  Data","18 pages, 7 figures, accepted to Phys. Rev. D",,,,astro-ph.CO,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Recent observations suggest that there are violations of the isotropy of the
universe at large scales, an important part of the cosmological principle. In
this paper, we use the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data to search for
spatial variations of the cosmological parameters in the $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$
model. We fit the Planck temperature angular power spectrum
$\mathcal{C}^{TT}_\ell$ for 48 different half-skies, centering on 48 different
directions, to search for directional dependences of the standard cosmological
parameters. There are $3(2)\sigma$-level directional variations in
$\Omega_bh^2$, $\Omega_ch^2$, $n_s$, $100\theta_\mathrm{MC}$, and $H_0$ $(\tau$
and $\ln(10^{10}A_s))$. Furthermore, the directional distributions of the
parameters follow a dipole form to good approximation. The Bayes factor between
the isotropic and anisotropic hypotheses is $0.0041$, strongly disfavouring the
former. The best-fit dipole axes for $\Omega_bh^2$, $\Omega_ch^2$, $n_s$,
$100\theta_\mathrm{MC}$, and $A_s e^{-2\tau}$ all generally align with the mean
direction of $\boldsymbol{V} \equiv (b = -5.6^{+17.0{\circ}}_{-17.4}, l =
48.8^{+14.3{\circ}}_{-14.4})$, which is roughly perpendicular to the dipole of
the variation in fine structure constant, and is about $45^{\circ}$ to the
directions of the CMB kinematic dipole, CMB parity asymmetry, and polarization
of QSOs. Our results suggest either significant violation of the cosmological
principle, or previously unknown systematic errors in the standard CMB
analysis.

collected a new fashion product dataset with 853,056 products in total.
Finally, we trained a deep learning model that can explicitly predict and

from near infrared to near-visible bands. For many nonlinear and quantum
photonics applications, it is desirable to operate deep into the visible band
within LN's transparency window. However, the strong material dispersion at
short wavelengths makes phase-matching difficult, necessitating sub-micron
scale control of domain structures for efficient quasi-phase-matching (QPM).
Here we report the operation of thin film LN in the blue wavelength and high
fidelity poling of thin-film LN waveguide to this regime. As a result,
quasi-phase matching is realized between IR (871nm) and blue (435.5nm)
wavelengths in a straight waveguide and prompts strong blue light generation

2112.07583,Mingyang Song,"Mingyang Song, Liping Jing",Reinforcing Semantic-Symmetry for Document Summarization,"10 pages, 8 figures",,,,cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Document summarization condenses a long document into a short version with
salient information and accurate semantic descriptions. The main issue is how
to make the output summary semantically consistent with the input document. To
reach this goal, recently, researchers have focused on supervised end-to-end
hybrid approaches, which contain an extractor module and abstractor module.
Among them, the extractor identifies the salient sentences from the input
document, and the abstractor generates a summary from the salient sentences.
This model successfully keeps the consistency between the generated summary and
the reference summary via various strategies (e.g., reinforcement learning).
There are two semantic gaps when training the hybrid model (one is between
document and extracted sentences, and the other is between extracted sentences
and summary). However, they are not explicitly considered in the existing
methods, which usually results in a semantic bias of summary. To mitigate the
above issue, in this paper, a new \textbf{r}einforcing
s\textbf{e}mantic-\textbf{sy}mmetry learning \textbf{m}odel is proposed for
document summarization (\textbf{ReSyM}). ReSyM introduces a
semantic-consistency reward in the extractor to bridge the first gap. A
semantic dual-reward is designed to bridge the second gap in the abstractor.
The whole document summarization process is implemented via reinforcement
learning with a hybrid reward mechanism (combining the above two rewards).
Moreover, a comprehensive sentence representation learning method is presented
to sufficiently capture the information from the original document. A series of
experiments have been conducted on two wildly used benchmark datasets CNN/Daily
Mail and BigPatent. The results have shown the superiority of ReSyM by
comparing it with the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of various evaluation
metrics.

$cost_{c}(p,S)$ as the sum of distances from $p$ to the nearest $c $ points in
$S \setminus \{p\}$, where $c\geq 1$ is a fixed integer. We define
$cost_{c}(S)=\min_{p \in S}\{cost_{c}(p,S)\}$ for $S \subseteq P$. In the

  and Correcting for the Past",,,,,stat.ME stat.ML,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Instrumental variable (IV) regression relies on instruments to infer causal
effects from observational data with unobserved confounding. We consider IV
regression in time series models, such as vector auto-regressive (VAR)

propose methodology for constructing identifying equations that can be used for
consistently estimating causal effects. To do so, we develop nuisance IV, which
can be of interest even in the i.i.d. case, as it generalizes existing IV
methods. We further propose a graph marginalization framework that allows us to
apply nuisance and other IV methods in a principled way to time series. Our
framework builds on the global Markov property, which we prove holds for VAR
processes. For VAR(1) processes, we prove identifiability conditions that
relate to Jordan forms and are different from the well-known rank conditions in
the i.i.d. case (they do not require as many instruments as covariates, for
example). We provide methods, prove their consistency, and show how the
inferred causal effect can be used for distribution generalization. Simulation
experiments corroborate our theoretical results. We provide ready-to-use Python

flow has a stripe-like spatial structure. The width of the stripes L =

and the angle between them, and the length of the stripes is limited by the
system size. It was found that the vertical vorticity $\Omega$ of the current
on the fluid surface is proportional to the product of wave amplitudes, but its
value is much higher than the value corresponding to the Stokes drift and it
continues to grow with time even after the wave motion reaches a stationary

selection criterion for Bayesian statistics in recent years. It is an
asymptotically unbiased estimator of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a
Bayesian predictive distribution and the true distribution. Not only is the
WAIC theoretically more sound than other information criteria, its usefulness
in practice has also been reported. On the other hand, the WAIC is intended for
settings in which the prior distribution does not have an asymptotic influence,
and as we set the class of the prior distribution to be more complex, it never
fails to select the most complex one. To alleviate these concerns, this paper
proposed the prior intensified information criterion (PIIC). In addition, it
customizes this criterion to incorporate sparse estimation and causal
inference. Numerical experiments show that the PIIC clearly outperforms the
WAIC in terms of prediction performance when the above concerns are manifested.

recognition has reached a boiling point. As developers have continued to
swiftly expand the scope of these kinds of technologies into an almost
unbounded range of applications, an increasingly strident chorus of critical
voices has sounded concerns about the injurious effects of the proliferation of
such systems. Opponents argue that the irresponsible design and use of facial
detection and recognition technologies (FDRTs) threatens to violate civil
liberties, infringe on basic human rights and further entrench structural
racism and systemic marginalisation. They also caution that the gradual creep
of face surveillance infrastructures into every domain of lived experience may
eventually eradicate the modern democratic forms of life that have long
provided cherished means to individual flourishing, social solidarity and human
self-creation. Defenders, by contrast, emphasise the gains in public safety,
security and efficiency that digitally streamlined capacities for facial
identification, identity verification and trait characterisation may bring. In
this explainer, I focus on one central aspect of this debate: the role that
dynamics of bias and discrimination play in the development and deployment of
FDRTs. I examine how historical patterns of discrimination have made inroads
into the design and implementation of FDRTs from their very earliest moments.
And, I explain the ways in which the use of biased FDRTs can lead
distributional and recognitional injustices. The explainer concludes with an
exploration of broader ethical questions around the potential proliferation of
pervasive face-based surveillance infrastructures and makes some
recommendations for cultivating more responsible approaches to the development
and governance of these technologies.

produce aerosol levels that are comparable to normal speech in quantity and

decays to background indoor-air levels approximately 2 m away from the

reason at abstract levels in open-ended environments. Towards this goal, we
propose a novel and general method that finds action-grounded, discrete object
and effect categories and builds probabilistic rules over them that can be used
in complex action planning. Our robot interacts with single and multiple
objects using a given action repertoire and observes the effects created in the
environment. In order to form action-grounded object, effect, and relational
categories, we employ a binarized bottleneck layer of a predictive, deep
encoder-decoder network that takes as input the image of the scene and the
action applied, and generates the resulting object displacements in the scene
(action effects) in pixel coordinates. The binary latent vector represents a
learned, action-driven categorization of objects. To distill the knowledge
represented by the neural network into rules useful for symbolic reasoning, we
train a decision tree to reproduce its decoder function. From its branches we
extract probabilistic rules and represent them in PPDDL, allowing off-the-shelf
planners to operate on the robot's sensorimotor experience. Our system is
verified in a physics-based 3d simulation environment where a robot arm-hand

query matching against large-scale reference databases within a short time. We
define this as the query matching problem in ER in this work. Indexing or

provoked questions about the very nature of reality. We address these questions
by considering the universe, and the multiverse, fundamentally as complex
patterns, or mathematical structures. Basic mathematical structures can be
expressed more simply in terms of emergent parameters. Even simple mathematical
structures can interact within their own structural environment, in a
rudimentary form of self-awareness, which suggests a definition of reality in a
mathematical structure as simply the complete structure. The absolute
randomness of quantum outcomes is most satisfactorily explained by a multiverse
of discrete, parallel universes. Some of these have to be identical to each
other, but that introduces a dilemma, because each mathematical structure must
be unique. The resolution is that the parallel universes must be embedded
within a mathematical structure, the multiverse, which allows universes to be
identical within themselves, but nevertheless distinct, as determined by their
position in the structure. The multiverse needs more emergent parameters than
our universe and so it can be considered to be a superstructure.
Correspondingly, its reality can be called a super-reality. While every
universe in the multiverse is part of the super-reality, the complete
super-reality is forever beyond the horizon of any of its component universes.

behaviours in abstract models of computation. Therefore, given a monoid $M$, it
is natural to ask how long a sequence of elements of $M$ needs to be to ensure
the presence of consecutive idempotent factors. This question is formalised
through the notion of the Ramsey function $R_M$ associated to M, obtained by
mapping every positive integer $k$ to the minimal integer $R_M(k)$ such that
every word $u$ in $M^*$ of length $R_M(k)$ contains $k$ consecutive non-empty
factors that correspond to the same idempotent element of $M$.
  In this work, we study the behaviour of the Ramsey function $R_M$ by
investigating the regular $D$-length of $M$, defined as the largest size $L(M)$
of a submonoid of $M$ isomorphic to the set of natural numbers $\{1,2, ...,

structures for computing ray-object intersections. Less known is the
Constrained Convex Space Partitioning (CCSP), which partitions space and makes
the geometric primitives exactly overlap with the boundaries of its cells.
Consequently, it is robust against ill-fitting cells that plague methods with
axis-aligned cells (kd-tree, BVH) and it permits an efficient, stackless
traversal.
  Within computer graphics, CCSPs have received some attention in both 2D and
3D, but their construction methods were never directly aimed at minimizing
their traversal cost -- even having fundamentally opposing goals for
Delaunay-type methods. Instead, for an isotropic and translation-invariant ray
distribution the traversal cost is minimized by minimizing the weight: the
total boundary size of all cells in the structure.
  We study the 2D case using triangulations as CCSPs and minimize their total
edge length using a simulated annealing process that allows for topological
changes and varying vertex count. Standard Delaunay-based triangulation
techniques show total edge lengths ranging from 10% higher to twice as high as
our optimized triangulations for a variety of scenes, with a similar difference
in traversal cost when using the triangulations for ray tracing. Compared to a
roped kd-tree, our triangulations require less traversal steps for all scenes
that we tested and they are robust against the kd-tree's pathological behaviour
when geometry becomes misaligned with the world axes. Moreover, the stackless
traversal strongly outperforms a BVH, which always requires a top-down descent
in the hierarchy. In fact, we show several scenes where the number of traversal
operations for our triangulations decreases(!) as the number of geometric
primitives $N$ increases, in contrast to the increasing $\log N$ behaviour of a
BVH.

Large Program (LP) that is identifying and performing a first characterization
of many of the most luminous star-forming galaxies known in the z>6.5 universe.
REBELS is providing this probe by systematically scanning 40 of the brightest
UV-selected galaxies identified over a 7-deg**2 area for bright 158-micron
[CII] and 88-micron [OIII] lines and dust-continuum emission. Selection of the
40 REBELS targets was done by combining our own and other photometric
selections, each of which is subject to extensive vetting using three
completely independent sets of photometry and template-fitting codes. Building
on the observational strategy deployed in two pilot programs, we are increasing
the number of massive interstellar medium (ISM) reservoirs known at z>6.5 by
~4-5x to >30. In this manuscript, we motivate the observational strategy
deployed in the REBELS program and present initial results. Based on the 60.6
hours of ALMA observations taken in the first year of the program (November
2019 to January 2020), 18 highly significant >~7sigma [CII] lines have already
been discovered, the bulk of which (13/18) also show >~3.3 sigma dust-continuum
emission. These newly discovered lines more than triple the number of bright
ISM-cooling lines known in the z>6.5 universe, such that the number of
ALMA-derived redshifts at z>6.5 already rival Lya redshift discoveries. An
analysis of the completeness of our search results vs. star formation rate
(SFR) suggests an ~79% efficiency in scanning for [CII] when the SFR(UV+IR) is
in excess of 28 M_sol/yr. These new LP results further demonstrate ALMA's
efficiency as a ""redshift machine"", particularly in the epoch of reionization.

replaced by an 800 MeV superconducting LINAC (PIP-II) with an increased beam
power >50% of the PIP design goal. Both in PIP and PIP-II era, the existing
Booster is going to play a very significant role, at least for next two
decades. In the meanwhile, we have recently developed an innovative beam
injection and bunching scheme for the Booster called ""early injection scheme""

classification and object detection, and achieve stunning success in terms of
their high accuracy over the traditional statistical methods. To exploit the
potential of CNN models, a huge amount of research and industry efforts have
been devoted to optimizing CNNs. Among these endeavors, CNN architecture design
has attracted tremendous attention because of its great potential of improving
model accuracy or reducing model complexity. However, existing work either
introduces repeated training overhead in the search process or lacks an
interpretable metric to guide the design. To clear these hurdles, we propose
3D-Receptive Field (3DRF), an explainable and easy-to-compute metric, to
estimate the quality of a CNN architecture and guide the search process of
designs. To validate the effectiveness of 3DRF, we build a static optimizer to
improve the CNN architectures at both the stage level and the kernel level. Our
optimizer not only provides a clear and reproducible procedure but also
mitigates unnecessary training efforts in the architecture search process.
Extensive experiments and studies show that the models generated by our
optimizer can achieve up to 5.47% accuracy improvement and up to 65.38%
parameters deduction, compared with state-of-the-art CNN structures like

provide Pareto-optimal plans trading off between material waste, fabrication
time, precision, and other considerations. However, when developing fabrication
plans, experts rarely restrict to a single design, instead considering families
of design variations, sometimes adjusting designs to simplify fabrication.
Jointly exploring the design and fabrication plan spaces for each design is
intractable using current techniques. We present a new approach to jointly
optimize design and fabrication plans for carpentered objects. To make this
bi-level optimization tractable, we adapt recent work from program synthesis
based on equality graphs (e-graphs), which encode sets of equivalent programs.
Our insight is that subproblems within our bi-level problem share significant
substructures. By representing both designs and fabrication plans in a new bag
of parts(BOP) e-graph, we amortize the cost of optimizing design components
shared among multiple candidates. Even using BOP e-graphs, the optimization
space grows quickly in practice. Hence, we also show how a feedback-guided
search strategy dubbed Iterative Contraction and Expansion on E-graphs(ICEE)
can keep the size of the e-graph manage-able and direct the search toward
promising candidates. We illustrate the advantages of our pipeline through
examples from the carpentry domain.

our investigation, we propose a novel evaluation strategy, ClassWise DG (CWDG),

wave optics, for two widely used lens models such as point mass lens and
Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS). Observable effects due to wave nature of
gravitational waves are discussed. As a consequence of interference GWs produce
beat patterns which might be observable with the next generation detectors like

how much a feature vector informs us about an attribute, where a feature vector
can be from internal or final layers of a network. Expressivity is computed by
a second neural network whose inputs are features and attributes. The output of
the second neural network approximates the mutual information between feature
vectors and an attribute. We investigate the expressivity for two different
deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) architectures: a Resnet-101 and an

found the order of expressivity for facial attributes to be Age > Sex > Yaw.
Additionally, we studied the changes in the encoding of facial attributes over

yaw, sex, and age decrease. Our technique can be a tool for investigating the

  Inference for the Internet of Things?",,,,,cs.CR,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Collaborative inference has recently emerged as an intriguing framework for
applying deep learning to Internet of Things (IoT) applications, which works by
splitting a DNN model into two subpart models respectively on
resource-constrained IoT devices and the cloud. Even though IoT applications'
raw input data is not directly exposed to the cloud in such framework,
revealing the local-part model's intermediate output still entails privacy
risks. For mitigation of privacy risks, differential privacy could be adopted
in principle. However, the practicality of differential privacy for
collaborative inference under various conditions remains unclear. For example,
it is unclear how the calibration of the privacy budget epsilon will affect the
protection strength and model accuracy in presence of the state-of-the-art
reconstruction attack targeting collaborative inference, and whether a good
privacy-utility balance exists. In this paper, we provide the first systematic
study to assess the effectiveness of differential privacy for protecting
collaborative inference in presence of the reconstruction attack, through
extensive empirical evaluations on various datasets. Our results show
differential privacy can be used for collaborative inference when confronted
with the reconstruction attack, with insights provided about privacyutility
trade-offs. Specifically, across the evaluated datasets, we observe there
exists a suitable privacy budget range (particularly 100<=epsilon<=200 in our
evaluation) providing a good tradeoff between utility and privacy protection.
Our key observation drawn from our study is that differential privacy tends to
perform better in collaborative inference for datasets with smaller intraclass
variations, which, to our knowledge, is the first easy-toadopt practical

  convection-driven plane layer dynamos",,,,,physics.flu-dyn physics.geo-ph,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Rapidly rotating convection-driven dynamos are investigated under different
kinematic and magnetic boundary conditions using DNS. At a fixed rotation rate,
represented by the Ekman number $E=5\times10^{-7}$, the thermal forcing is
varied from 2 to 20 times its value at the onset of convection
($\mathcal{R}=Ra/Ra_c=2-20$), keeping the fluid properties constant
($Pr=Pr_m=1$). The statistical behavior, force balance and heat transport
characteristics of the dynamos depend on boundary conditions that dictate both
boundary layer and the interior dynamics. At a fixed thermal forcing
($\mathcal{R}=3$), the Ekman plumes in the presence of viscous boundary layers
lead to energetic vortices that result in higher enstrophy and kinetic helicity
with no-slip boundaries compared to free-slip boundaries. The structure and
strength of the magnetic field are also dictated by the boundary conditions.
Though the leading order force balance remains geostrophic, Lorentz force
dominates inside the thermal boundary layer with no-slip, electrically
conducting walls. Here, the Lorentz work term in the turbulent kinetic energy
budget is found to have components that exchange energy from the velocity field
to the magnetic field, and vice-versa. However, with no-slip, insulated walls,
all Lorentz work components perform unidirectional energy transfer to produce
magnetic energy from the kinetic energy of the fluid. The heat transfer
enhancement in dynamos, compared to non-magnetic rotating convection, exhibits
a peak in the range $\mathcal{R}=3-5$. For free-slip conditions, dynamo action
may alter the heat transport by suppressing the formation of large-scale
vortices. However, the highest heat transfer enhancement occurs when the
boundaries are no-slip, electrically conducting walls.

Formal static analysis is seeing increasingly widespread adoption as a tool for

While existing techniques offer some demand-driven or incremental aspects for
certain classes of analysis, the fundamental challenge we tackle is doing both

  Our technique, demanded abstract interpretation, lifts program syntax and
analysis state to a dynamically evolving graph structure, in which program
edits, client-issued queries, and evaluation of abstract semantics are all
treated uniformly. The key difficulty addressed by our approach is the
application of general incremental computation techniques to the complex,
cyclic dependency structure induced by abstract interpretation of loops with
widening operators. We prove that desirable abstract interpretation
meta-properties, including soundness and termination, are preserved in our
approach, and that demanded analysis results are equal to those computed by a
batch abstract interpretation. Experimental results suggest promise for a
prototype demanded abstract interpretation framework: by combining incremental

results at interactive speeds, answering 95% of queries within 1.2 seconds.

come in cluttered configurations, randomly orientated and overlapping. Recent
work on log picking automation usually assume that the logs' pose is known,
with little consideration given to the actual perception problem. In this
paper, we squarely address the latter, using a data-driven approach. First, we
introduce a novel dataset, named TimberSeg 1.0, that is densely annotated,
i.e., that includes both bounding boxes and pixel-level mask annotations for
logs. This dataset comprises 220 images with 2500 individually segmented logs.
Using our dataset, we then compare three neural network architectures on the
task of individual logs detection and segmentation; two region-based methods
and one attention-based method. Unsurprisingly, our results show that
axis-aligned proposals, failing to take into account the directional nature of
logs, underperform with 19.03 mAP. A rotation-aware proposal method
significantly improve results to 31.83 mAP. More interestingly, a
Transformer-based approach, without any inductive bias on rotations,
outperformed the two others, achieving a mAP of 57.53 on our dataset. Our use
case demonstrates the limitations of region-based approaches for cluttered,
elongated objects. It also highlights the potential of attention-based methods
on this specific task, as they work directly at the pixel-level. These
encouraging results indicate that such a perception system could be used to
assist the operators on the short-term, or to fully automate log picking
operations in the future.

rely on the quality of synthesized features to recognize seen and unseen data.
Therefore, learning a joint distribution of seen-unseen domains and preserving
domain distinction is crucial for these methods. However, existing methods only
learn the underlying distribution of seen data, although unseen class semantics
are available in the GZSL problem setting. Most methods neglect retaining
domain distinction and use the learned distribution to recognize seen and
unseen data. Consequently, they do not perform well. In this work, we utilize
the available unseen class semantics alongside seen class semantics and learn
joint distribution through a strong visual-semantic coupling. We propose a
bidirectional mapping coupled generative adversarial network (BMCoGAN) by
extending the coupled generative adversarial network into a dual-domain
learning bidirectional mapping model. We further integrate a Wasserstein
generative adversarial optimization to supervise the joint distribution
learning. We design a loss optimization for retaining domain distinctive
information in the synthesized features and reducing bias towards seen classes,
which pushes synthesized seen features towards real seen features and pulls
synthesized unseen features away from real seen features. We evaluate BMCoGAN
on benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superior performance against
contemporary methods.

complex multiscale fluids and then focus on the derivation and analysis of a
new hybrid continuum-kinetic model. In particular, we combine conservation of
mass and momentum for an isentropic macroscopic model with a kinetic
representation of the microscopic behaviour. After introducing a small scale of
interest, we compute the complex stress tensor by means of Irving-Kirkwood
formula. The latter requires an expansion of kinetic distribution around an
equilibrium state and a successive homogenization over the fast in time and
small in space scale dynamics. For a new hybrid continuum-kinetic model the
results of linear stability analysis indicates a conditional stability in the
relevant low-speed regimes and instability for high speed regimes for higher
modes. Extensive numerical experiments confirm that the proposed multiscale
model can reflect new phenomena of complex fluids not being present in standard
Newtonian fluids. Consequently, the proposed general technique can be
successfully used to derive new interesting systems combining the macro and
micro structure of a given physical problem.

galaxies, and feedback from the high-mass stars in these clusters can have
profound effects on the surrounding interstellar medium. The nuclear starburst
in the nearby galaxy NGC253 at a distance of 3.5 Mpc is a key laboratory in
which to study star formation in an extreme environment. Previous high
resolution (1.9 pc) dust continuum observations from ALMA discovered 14
compact, massive super star clusters (SSCs) still in formation. We present here
ALMA data at 350 GHz with 28 milliarcsecond (0.5 pc) resolution. We detect
blueshifted absorption and redshifted emission (P-Cygni profiles) towards three
of these SSCs in multiple lines, including CS 7$-$6 and H$^{13}$CN 4$-$3, which
represents direct evidence for previously unobserved outflows. The mass
contained in these outflows is a significant fraction of the cluster gas
masses, which suggests we are witnessing a short but important phase. Further
evidence of this is the finding of a molecular shell around the only SSC
visible at near-IR wavelengths. We model the P-Cygni line profiles to constrain
the outflow geometry, finding that the outflows must be nearly spherical.
Through a comparison of the outflow properties with predictions from
simulations, we find that none of the available mechanisms completely explains
the observations, although dust-reprocessed radiation pressure and O star
stellar winds are the most likely candidates. The observed outflows will have a
very substantial effect on the clusters' evolution and star formation
efficiency.

able to predict (i.e., anticipate) future events, and execute actions in a
timely manner. However, the observation of the human limb movements may not be
sufficient to anticipate their actions unambiguously. In this work, we consider
two additional sources of information (i.e., context) over time, gaze, movement
and object information, and study how these additional contextual cues improve
the action anticipation performance. We address action anticipation as a
classification task, where the model takes the available information as the
input and predicts the most likely action. We propose to use the uncertainty
about each prediction as an online decision-making criterion for action
anticipation. Uncertainty is modeled as a stochastic process applied to a
time-based neural network architecture, which improves the conventional
class-likelihood (i.e., deterministic) criterion. The main contributions of
this paper are four-fold: (i) We propose a novel and effective decision-making
criterion that can be used to anticipate actions even in situations of high
ambiguity; (ii) we propose a deep architecture that outperforms previous
results in the action anticipation task when using the Acticipate collaborative

curve and orientation of a rigid body moving along a railway track. Compared to
other recent developments in the literature, the presented approach has the
significant advantage of tracking the position and orientation of a railway
vehicle using inertial sensors only, excluding global position sensors (GNSS or
total station) and also excluding global orientation sensors (magnetometers or
inclinometers). The algorithm is based on a kinematic model of the relative
motion of the body with respect to the track. This kinematic model is used as
the system equations of a Kalman filter algorithm that includes in the state
vector the coordinates used to define the position and orientation of the body.
Two different Kalman filter approaches are described. In the first one, the
position and orientation are calculated independently. In the second one, both
position and orientation are calculated as a coupled problem. Crucial to the
success of the results of the Kalman filters is the use of the correct
covariance matrices associated with the system process and the measurements.
The calculated trajectory and orientation are applied in this research to the
problem of track geometry measurement. A scale track with known design geometry
and irregularities is used to conduct experiments for tuning and evaluating the
quality of the output of the algorithm. Results show that the developed
algorithm is accurate enough for this application. They also show that, using
either of the two proposed Kalman filtering approaches, the constrained maximum
likelihood method for the estimation of the covariance matrices performs
similarly to the known-output method. This is very convenient because it allows
a straightforward application of the observation model in different scenarios.

through behavioral repetition, it can trigger behavior automatically in the
same environment. Given the reciprocal relationship between habit and behavior,
changing lifestyle behaviors (e.g., toothbrushing) is largely a task of
breaking old habits and creating new and healthy ones. Thus, representing
users' habit strengths can be very useful for behavior change support systems
(BCSS), for example, to predict behavior or to decide when an intervention
reaches its intended effect. However, habit strength is not directly observable
and existing self-report measures are taxing for users. In this paper, built on
recent computational models of habit formation, we propose a method to enable
intelligent systems to compute habit strength based on observable behavior. The
hypothesized advantage of using computed habit strength for behavior prediction
was tested using data from two intervention studies, where we trained
participants to brush their teeth twice a day for three weeks and monitored
their behaviors using accelerometers. Through hierarchical cross-validation, we
found that for the task of predicting future brushing behavior, computed habit
strength clearly outperformed self-reported habit strength (in both studies)
and was also superior to models based on past behavior frequency (in the larger
second study). Our findings provide initial support for our theory-based
approach of modeling user habits and encourages the use of habit computation to

motion of Bloch electrons by pre-localization due to the band-structure
properties. Another known source of electronic localization in solids is the
Coulomb repulsion in partially filled d- or f-orbitals, which leads to the
formation of local magnetic moments. The combination of these two effects is
usually considered of little relevance to strongly correlated materials. Here
we show that it represents, instead, the underlying physical mechanism in two
of the most important ferromagnets: nickel and iron. In nickel, the van Hove
singularity has an unexpected impact on the magnetism. As a result, the
electron-electron scattering rate is linear in temperature, in violation of the
conventional Landau theory of metals. This is true even at Earth's core
pressures, at which iron is instead a good Fermi liquid. The importance of
nickel in models of geomagnetism may have therefore to be reconsidered.

original definition might include infinite computations, and is not consistent
with other proposals for Datalog semantics over annotated data. In this work,

adaptively remove the motion blur in spike streams according to the prior
motion. Further, for training SCFlow, we synthesize two sets of optical flow

High-speed Motion, denoted as SPIFT and PHM respectively, corresponding to

topology. Here we study how quantum information and correlations spread under a
quantum quench generated by a prototypical non-Hermitian spin chain. Using the
mapping to fermions we solve exactly the problem and compute the entanglement
entropy and the correlation dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. Depending on
the quench parameters, we identify two dynamical phases. One is characterized
by rapidly saturating entanglement and correlations. The other instead presents
a logarithmic growth in time, and correlations spreading faster than the
Lieb-Robinson bound, with collapses and revivals giving rise to a modulated
light-cone structure. Here, in the long-time limit, we compute analytically the
entanglement entropy that we show to scale logarithmically with the size of the
cut, with an effective central charge that we obtain in closed form. Our
results provide an example of an exactly solvable non-Hermitian many-body
problem that shows rich physics including entanglement and spectral
transitions.

perfectly realized once the thermal boundary layer is fully decoupled from the
viscous boundary layer and locates inside the turbulent bulk. The heat flux can
be greatly enhanced by one order of magnitude. Our results provide concrete
evidences for the appearance of the ultimate state when the entire thermal

trained on synthetic binary voxelized unit cells of composite materials with
uncertain three dimensional microstructures, uncertain linear elastic material

which textual units are assigned to an emotion from a predefined inventory
(e.g., fear, joy, anger, disgust, sadness, surprise, trust, anticipation). More
recently, semantic role labeling approaches have been developed to extract
structures from the text to answer questions like: ""who is described to feel
the emotion?"" (experiencer), ""what causes this emotion?"" (stimulus), and at
which entity is it directed?"" (target). Though it has been shown that jointly
modeling stimulus and emotion category prediction is beneficial for both
subtasks, it remains unclear which of these semantic roles enables a classifier
to infer the emotion. Is it the experiencer, because the identity of a person
is biased towards a particular emotion (X is always happy)? Is it a particular
target (everybody loves X) or a stimulus (doing X makes everybody sad)? We
answer these questions by training emotion classification models on five
available datasets annotated with at least one semantic role by masking the
fillers of these roles in the text in a controlled manner and find that across
multiple corpora, stimuli and targets carry emotion information, while the
experiencer might be considered a confounder. Further, we analyze if informing
the model about the position of the role improves the classification decision.

give high-level commands instead of low-level control of the tools. We present
a data-set of needle insertion in soft tissue with two arms where Arm 1 inserts
the needle into the tissue and Arm 2 actively manipulate the soft tissue to
ensure the desired and actual exit points are the same. This is important in
real-surgery because suturing without active manipulation of tissue may yield
failure of the suturing as the stitch may not grip enough tissue to resist the
force applied for the suturing. We present a needle insertion dataset including

corruptions, equipment failures or cyber-attacks. The unreliable agents, which
are called as Byzantine agents thereafter, can send faulty values to their

Byzantine attacks is to formulate a total variation (TV) norm-penalized
approximation of the Byzantine-free problem, where the penalty term forces the
local models of regular agents to be close, but also allows the existence of
outliers from the Byzantine agents. A stochastic subgradient method is applied
to solve the penalized problem. We prove that the proposed method reaches a
neighborhood of the Byzantine-free optimal solution, and the size of
neighborhood is determined by the number of Byzantine agents and the network

continental shelves even at slopes as low as 1{\deg} and can cause significant
casualty and damage to infrastructure. The run-out mechanism in a submarine
landslide is affected by factors such as the initial packing density,
permeability, slope angle, and initial volume. While past studies have focused
on the influence of density, permeability, and slope angle on the granular
column collapse, the impact of volume on the run-out characteristics has not
been investigated. This study aims to understand how the initial volume affects
the run-out using a two-dimensional coupled lattice Boltzman and discrete
element (LBM-DEM) method. The coupled LBM-DEM approach allows simulating fluid
flow at the pore-scale resolution to understand the grain-scale mechanisms
driving the complex continuum-scale response in the granular column collapse.
For submerged granular column collapse, the run-out mechanism is heavily
influenced by the interaction between the grains and the surrounding fluid. The
development of negative pore pressures during shearing and hydrodynamic drag
forces inhibit the flow. On the other hand, entrainment of water resulting in
hydroplaning enhances the flow. With an increase in volume, the interaction
between the grains and the surrounding fluid varies, causing changes in the
run-out behavior. For smaller volumes, the forces inhibiting the underwater
flow predominates, resulting in shorter run-outs than their dry counterparts.
At large volumes, hydroplaning results in larger run-out than the dry cases,
despite the inhibiting effects of drag forces and negative pore pressures.

similarity measure defined on item pairs, which is a common practical use-case.
By design, our approach directly maximizes off-the-shelf relevance functions
and does not require any proxy auxiliary models. Via extensive experiments, we

forget in continual learning settings. The following three factors can affect
catastrophic forgetting in the output layer: (1) weights modifications, (2)
interference, and (3) projection drift. In this paper, our goal is to provide
more insights into how changing the output layers may address (1) and (2). Some
potential solutions to those issues are proposed and evaluated here in several
continual learning scenarios. We show that the best-performing type of the
output layer depends on the data distribution drifts and/or the amount of data
available. In particular, in some cases where a standard linear layer would
fail, it turns out that changing parameterization is sufficient in order to
achieve a significantly better performance, whithout introducing a
continual-learning algorithm and instead using the standard SGD to train a
model. Our analysis and results shed light on the dynamics of the output layer
in continual learning scenarios, and suggest a way of selecting the best type
of output layer for a given scenario.

We couple domain invariance in a probabilistic formula with the variational

principled way. Specifically, we derive domain-invariant representations and
classifiers, which are jointly established in a two-layer Bayesian neural
network. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal on four
widely used cross-domain visual recognition benchmarks. Ablation studies
validate the synergistic benefits of our Bayesian treatment when jointly
learning domain-invariant representations and classifiers for domain
generalization. Further, our method consistently delivers state-of-the-art mean

population-wide mobility patterns from anonymised mobile phone location data
and subsequently superimposes a vehicle charging and discharging scheme. The
framework allows for the estimation of the aggregate V2G energy supply and

input code fragment. If that is the case, SATDID will automatically generate
the appropriate descriptive SATD comment that can be attached with the code.
While our approach is applicable in principle to any type of code fragments, we
focus in this study on technical debt hidden in conditional statements, one of

incorporating these information. In particular, Eco-Cruise and Eco-Lane
Selection on highways and/or motorways have immense potential to save energy,
because there are generally fewer traffic controllers and the vehicles keep
moving in general. In this paper, we present a cooperative and energy-efficient
lane-selection strategy named MultiCruise, where each CAV selects one among
multiple candidate lanes that allows the most energy-efficient travel.
MultiCruise incorporates an Eco-Cruise component to select the most
energy-efficient lane. The Eco-Cruise component calculates the driving
parameters and prospective energy consumption of the ego vehicle for each
candidate lane, and the Eco-Lane Selection component uses these values. As a
result, MultiCruise can account for multiple data sources, such as the road
curvature and the surrounding vehicles' velocities and accelerations. The
eco-autonomous driving strategy, MultiCruise, is tested, designed and verified
by using a co-simulation test platform that includes autonomous driving
software and realistic road networks to study the performance under realistic

these phenomena in machine learning might transform the curse of dimensionality
into the blessing of dimensionality.
  This paper summarises recently discovered phenomena of measure concentration
which drastically simplify some machine learning problems in high dimension,
and allow us to correct legacy artificial intelligence systems. The classical
concentration of measure theorems state that i.i.d. random points are
concentrated in a thin layer near a surface (a sphere or equators of a sphere,
an average or median level set of energy or another Lipschitz function, etc.).
  The new stochastic separation theorems describe the thin structure of these
thin layers: the random points are not only concentrated in a thin layer but
are all linearly separable from the rest of the set, even for exponentially
large random sets. The linear functionals for separation of points can be
selected in the form of the linear Fisher's discriminant.
  All artificial intelligence systems make errors. Non-destructive correction
requires separation of the situations (samples) with errors from the samples
corresponding to correct behaviour by a simple and robust classifier. The
stochastic separation theorems provide us by such classifiers and a
non-iterative (one-shot) procedure for learning.

such that $\| A(I -ZZ^\top)\|_{S_p} \leq (1+\epsilon)\min_{U^\top U = I_k}
\|A(I - U U^\top)\|_{S_p}$, where $\|M\|_{S_p}$ denotes the $\ell_p$ norm of
the the singular values of $M$. For the special cases of $p=2$ (Frobenius norm)
and $p = \infty$ (Spectral norm), Musco and Musco (NeurIPS 2015) obtained an
algorithm based on Krylov methods that uses $\tilde{O}(k/\sqrt{\epsilon})$
matrix-vector products, improving on the na\""ive $\tilde{O}(k/\epsilon)$
dependence obtainable by the power method, where $\tilde{O}$ suppresses
poly$(\log(dk/\epsilon))$ factors.
  Our main result is an algorithm that uses only
$\tilde{O}(kp^{1/6}/\epsilon^{1/3})$ matrix-vector products, and works for all
$p \geq 1$. For $p = 2$ our bound improves the previous
$\tilde{O}(k/\epsilon^{1/2})$ bound to $\tilde{O}(k/\epsilon^{1/3})$. Since the
Schatten-$p$ and Schatten-$\infty$ norms are the same up to a $1+ \epsilon$
factor when $p \geq (\log d)/\epsilon$, our bound recovers the result of Musco

of $\Omega(1/\epsilon^{1/3})$ for any fixed constant $p \geq 1$, showing that
surprisingly $\tilde{\Theta}(1/\epsilon^{1/3})$ is the optimal complexity for
constant~$k$.
  To obtain our results, we introduce several new techniques, including
optimizing over multiple Krylov subspaces simultaneously, and pinching
inequalities for partitioned operators. Our lower bound for $p \in [1,2]$ uses

based on introducing a new packer but on the augmentation of the capabilities
of an existing and widely used tool for packaging Python, PyInstaller but can

range of grain sizes are transported as bedload. More particularly, vertical
size segregation is a multi-scale process that originates in interactions at
the scale of particles with important morphological consequences on the reach
scale. To address this issue, a volume-averaged multi-phase flow model for
immersed bidisperse granular flows was developed based on an interparticle
segregation force (Guillard et al. 2016) and a granular Stokesian drag force
(Tripathi and Khakhar 2013). An advection-diffusion model was derived from this
model yielding parametrisations for the advection and diffusion coefficients
based on the interparticle interactions. This approach makes it possible to
bridge the gap between grain-scale physics and continuum modelling. Both models
were successfully tested against existing Discrete Element Model (DEM)
simulations of size segregation in bedload transport (Chassagne et al. 2020).
Through a detailed investigation of the granular forces, it is demonstrated
that the observed scaling of the advection and diffusion coefficients with the
inertial number can be explained by the granular drag force dependency on the
viscosity. The drag coefficient was shown to be linearly dependent on the small
particle concentration. The scaling relationship of the segregation force with
the friction coefficient is confirmed and additional non-trivial dependencies
including the inertial number and small particle concentration are identified.
Lastly, adding a size ratio dependency in the segregation force perfectly
reproduces the DEM results for a large range of small particle concentrations
and size-ratios.

VR based driving simulator platform designed with behavioural and interaction
research priorities in mind. DReyeVR (read ""driver"") is based on Unreal Engine
and the CARLA autonomous vehicle simulator and has features such as eye
tracking, a functional driving heads-up display (HUD) and vehicle audio, custom
definable routes and traffic scenarios, experimental logging, replay

  (arXiv:2007.14045), with additional results",,,,cs.AI cs.CC,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  In Machine Learning, the $\mathsf{SHAP}$-score is a version of the Shapley
value that is used to explain the result of a learned model on a specific
entity by assigning a score to every feature. While in general computing
Shapley values is an intractable problem, we prove a strong positive result
stating that the $\mathsf{SHAP}$-score can be computed in polynomial time over
deterministic and decomposable Boolean circuits. Such circuits are studied in
the field of Knowledge Compilation and generalize a wide range of Boolean
circuits and binary decision diagrams classes, including binary decision trees
and Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs).
  We also establish the computational limits of the SHAP-score by observing
that computing it over a class of Boolean models is always polynomially as hard
as the model counting problem for that class. This implies that both
determinism and decomposability are essential properties for the circuits that
we consider. It also implies that computing $\mathsf{SHAP}$-scores is
intractable as well over the class of propositional formulas in DNF. Based on
this negative result, we look for the existence of fully-polynomial randomized
approximation schemes (FPRAS) for computing $\mathsf{SHAP}$-scores over such
class. In contrast to the model counting problem for DNF formulas, which admits
an FPRAS, we prove that no such FPRAS exists for the computation of
$\mathsf{SHAP}$-scores. Surprisingly, this negative result holds even for the
class of monotone formulas in DNF. These techniques can be further extended to
prove another strong negative result: Under widely believed complexity
assumptions, there is no polynomial-time algorithm that checks, given a
monotone DNF formula $\varphi$ and features $x,y$, whether the
$\mathsf{SHAP}$-score of $x$ in $\varphi$ is smaller than the
$\mathsf{SHAP}$-score of $y$ in $\varphi$.

idea to combine a set of single-transition-metal ferromagnetic semiconductors
together. Motivated by structural engineering on bilayer CrI$_3$ to tune its
magnetism and works that realize ideal properties by stacking van der Waals
transitional metal dichalcogenides in a certain order. Here we stack monolayer
VI$_3$ onto monolayer CrI$_3$ with a middle-layer I atoms discarded to
construct monolayer V$_2$Cr$_2$I$_9$. Based on this crystal model, the stable
and metastable phases are determined among 7 possible phases by
first-principles calculations. It is illustrated that both the two phases have
Curie temperature $\sim$ 6 (4) times higher than monolayer CrI$_3$ and VI$_3$.
The reason can be partly attributed to their large magnetic anisotropy energy
(the maximum value reaches 412.9 $\mu$eV/atom). More importantly, the Curie
temperature shows an electric field and strain dependent character and can even
surpass room temperature under a moderate strain range. At last, we believe
that the bimetal transition iodide V$_2$Cr$_2$I$_9$ monolayer would support
potential opportunities for spintronic devices.

the performance metrics for cast components through various modeling
techniques. However, a computationally efficient framework to account for
porosity with various shapes and sizes is still lacking. The main contribution
of this work is to address this limitation. Specifically, a novel porosity
sensitivity method is proposed, which integrates the merits of topological
sensitivity and shape sensitivity. While topological sensitivity approximates
the first order change on the quantity of interest when an infinitesimally
small spherical pore is inserted into a dense (no pore) structure, shape
sensitivity estimates the subsequent change in the quantity when the small pore
boundary is continuously perturbed to resemble the geometry reconstructed from
tomography characterization data. In this method, an exterior problem is solved
to explicitly formulate pore stress and strain fields as functions of shape
scaling parameters. By neglecting higher order pore-to-pore interaction terms,
the influence of multiple pores can be estimated through a linear
approximation. The proposed method is first studied on a benchmark example to
establish the impact of different pore parameters on the estimation accuracy.
The method is then applied onto case studies where the pore geometry is either
from tomography reconstruction or computer-generated representations.
Efficiency and accuracy of the method are finally demonstrated using a
commercial 3D application. The proposed method can be extended to other
manufacturing (e.g., additive manufacturing) induced porosity problems.

sheets end in the ocean. Ice mass loss via calving of the glaciers into the
ocean has increased over the last few decades. Information on the temporal
variability of the calving front position provides fundamental information on
the state of the glacier and ice stream, which can be exploited as calibration
and validation data to enhance ice dynamics modeling. To identify the calving
front position automatically, deep neural network-based semantic segmentation
pipelines can be used to delineate the acquired SAR imagery. However, the
extreme class imbalance is highly challenging for the accurate calving front
segmentation in these images. Therefore, we propose the use of the Mathews
correlation coefficient (MCC) as an early stopping criterion because of its
symmetrical properties and its invariance towards class imbalance. Moreover, we
propose an improvement to the distance map-based binary cross-entropy (BCE)
loss function. The distance map adds context to the loss function about the
important regions for segmentation and helps accounting for the imbalanced
data. Using Mathews correlation coefficient as early stopping demonstrates an
average 15% dice coefficient improvement compared to the commonly used BCE. The
modified distance map loss further improves the segmentation performance by
another 2%. These results are encouraging as they support the effectiveness of
the proposed methods for segmentation problems suffering from extreme class
imbalances.

knowledge distillation (KD) to effectively compress a transformer-based large

inconsistent regional visual tokens extracted from different detectors of
Teacher and Student, resulting in the misalignment of hidden representations
and attention distributions. To address the problem, we retrain and adapt the
Teacher by using the same region proposals from Student's detector while the
features are from Teacher's own object detector. With aligned network inputs,
the adapted Teacher is capable of transferring the knowledge through the
intermediate representations. Specifically, we use the mean square error loss
to mimic the attention distribution inside the transformer block and present a
token-wise noise contrastive loss to align the hidden state by contrasting with
negative representations stored in a sample queue. To this end, we show that
our proposed distillation significantly improves the performance of small VL
models on image captioning and visual question answering tasks. It reaches
120.8 in CIDEr score on COCO captioning, an improvement of 5.1 over its

oracle, is proposed. Sufficient conditions to ensure the existence of such
oracle are studied, proving that it can be derived for a general nonlinear
system if the economic cost function is a Morse function. Based on this oracle,
economic model predictive controllers are proposed, and their stability is
demonstrated in nominal conditions under a standard dissipativity assumption.
The viability of these controllers in practical settings (where the oracle may
provide imperfect predictions for generic inputs) is proven by means of
input-to-state stability. These properties have been illustrated in a case
study based on a continuously stirred tank reactor.

interest in developing novel neuromorphic hardware, including photonic
integrated circuits. Although an optical waveguide can accommodate hundreds of
channels with THz bandwidth, the channel count of photonic systems is always
bottlenecked by the devices within. In WDM-based photonic neural networks, the
synapses, i.e. network interconnections, are typically realized by microring
resonators (MRRs), where the WDM channel count (N) is bounded by the
free-spectral range of the MRRs. For typical Si MRRs, we estimate N <= 30
within the C-band. This not only restrains the aggregate throughput of the
neural network but also makes applications with high input dimensions
unfeasible. We experimentally demonstrate that photonic crystal nanobeam based
synapses can be FSR-free within C-band, eliminating the bound on channel count.
This increases data throughput as well as enables applications with
high-dimensional inputs like natural language processing and high resolution
image processing. In addition, the smaller physical footprint of photonic
crystal nanobeam cavities offers higher tuning energy efficiency and a higher
compute density than MRRs. Nanophotonic cavity based synapse thus offers a path
towards realizing highly scalable photonic neural networks.

Existing methods train multilingual models with additional code-mixed task data

this work, we enhance the transfer learning process by intermediate fine-tuning
of pretrained multilingual models, where the multilingual models are fine-tuned
with different but related data and/or tasks. Specifically, we use parallel and
conversational movie subtitles datasets to design cross-lingual intermediate
tasks suitable for downstream dialogue tasks. We use only 200K lines of

MUSE integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopy, we find the SN environment
contains three episodes of star formation; the low ejecta mass suggests the SN
progenitor is most likely from the oldest population, corresponding to an
initial mass of 10.4$^{+1.5}_{-1.3}$ $M_\odot$. The pre-explosion SED can be
reproduced by two components, one for the hot and compact SN progenitor and one
for a cool and inflated yellow hypergiant (YHG) companion that dominates the

the progenitor's binary companion is directly detected on pre-explosion images.
Both the low progenitor mass and the YHG companion suggest significant binary

constraints at the BS and unit-modulus constraints at the RIS. To address the
formulated optimization problem, we first decouple it into two tractable

alternately optimize the subproblems. Two different methods are proposed to
solve the two obtained subproblems. The first method transforms each subproblem
into a second order cone programming (SOCP) problem, which can be directly
solved using CVX. The second method leverages the Minorization- Maximization

which is a lower bound of the original objective function, and then the two
subproblems are transformed into two simple surrogate problems with closedform
solutions. Simulation results verify the performance gains of the proposed

experiments: a) without augmentation, b) Gaussian blur, c) rotation and
flipping, d) Gaussian blur, rotation and flipping and e) different input patch
sizes. All experiments were performed by patch-training both a 2D and 3D U-Net
and predicted on a test set of MRAs. Ground truth was manually defined using an
interactive threshold and region growing method. The performance was evaluated
using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Modified Hausdorff Distance and
Volumetric Similarity, between the predicted images and the interactively
defined ground truth. The segmentation performance of all trained networks on
the test set was found to be good, with DSC scores ranging from 0.72 to 0.83.
Both the 2D and 3D U-Net had the best segmentation performance with Gaussian

agreement with experiments and other theoretical calculations; in particular,
for Li$^+$/D$^-$ calculations predict the wrong ordering of importance of final
channels, including the incorrect most populated channel. The reason for this
anomaly is investigated and a leading constant to the asymptotic H$^-$
wavefunction is found that is different by roughly a factor $1/\sqrt{2}$ to
that which has been used in previous calculations with the surface integral

the solution using symmetric key is heavy re-keying cost. To reduce re-keying
cost tree based architecture is used. But it requires extra overhead to balance
the key- tree in order to achieve logarithmic re-keying cost. The main
challenging issue in dynamic and secure multimedia multicast communication is
to design a centralized group key management scheme with minimal computational,
communicational and storages complexities without breaching security issues.
Several authors have proposed different centralized group key management
schemes, wherein one of them proposes reducing communicational complexity but
increases computational and storage costs however another proposes decreasing
the computational and storage costs which eventually breaches forward and
backward secrecy. In this paper we propose a comparatively more efficient
centralized group key management scheme that not only minimize the

performing only binary classification, all models diagnose patients into five
severity categories, with stage zero representing healthy patients and stages
four and five representing patients with PD. The symptoms only, MRI scans only,
and hybrid models achieved accuracies of 0.77, 0.68, and 0.94, respectively.
The hybrid model also had high precision and recall scores of 0.94 and 0.95.
Real clinical cases confirm the strong performance of the hybrid, where
patients were classified incorrectly with both other models but correctly by
the hybrid. It is also consistent across the five severity stages, indicating
accurate early detection. This is the first report to combine symptoms data and
MRI scans with a machine learning approach on such a large scale.

emotion detector, artificial intelligence (AI). To date, researchers proposed
many factors that may affect happiness such as wealth, health and safety. Even
though these factors all seem relevant, there is no clear consensus between
sociologists on how to interpret these, and the models to estimate the cost of
these utilities include some assumptions. Researchers in social sciences have
been working on determination of the happiness levels in society and
exploration of the factors correlated with it through polls and different
statistical methods. In our work, by using artificial intelligence, we
introduce a different and relatively unbiased approach to this problem. By
using AI, we make no assumption about what makes a person happy, and leave the
decision to AI to detect the emotions from the faces of people collected from
publicly available street footages. We analyzed the happiness levels in eight
different cities around the world through available footage on the Internet and
found out that there is no statistically significant difference between
countries in terms of happiness.

non-linear reward function, extending existing work on adversarial linear
combinatorial bandit. {The adversarial combinatorial bandit with general
non-linear reward is an important open problem in bandit literature, and it is
still unclear whether there is a significant gap from the case of linear
reward, stochastic bandit, or semi-bandit feedback.} We show that, with $N$
arms and subsets of $K$ arms being chosen at each of $T$ time periods, the
minimax optimal regret is $\widetilde\Theta_{d}(\sqrt{N^d T})$ if the reward
function is a $d$-degree polynomial with $d< K$, and $\Theta_K(\sqrt{N^K T})$
if the reward function is not a low-degree polynomial. {Both bounds are
significantly different from the bound $O(\sqrt{\mathrm{poly}(N,K)T})$ for the
linear case, which suggests that there is a fundamental gap between the linear
and non-linear reward structures.} Our result also finds applications to
adversarial assortment optimization problem in online recommendation. We show
that in the worst-case of adversarial assortment problem, the optimal algorithm
must treat each individual $\binom{N}{K}$ assortment as independent.

spectrum radio quasar 3C 454.3 using {\it Fermi}-LAT and Swift XRT/UVOT data
are reported. In the $\gamma$-ray band, {\it Fermi}-LAT observations show
several major flares when the source flux was $>10^{-5}\:{\rm
photon\:cm^{-2}\:s^{-1}}$; the peak $\gamma$-ray flux above $141.6$ MeV,
$(9.22\pm1.96)\times10^{-5}\:{\rm photon\:cm^{-2}\:s^{-1}}$ observed on MJD
55519.33, corresponds to $2.15\times10^{50}\:{\rm erg\:s^{-1}}$ isotropic
$\gamma$-ray luminosity. The analysis of Swift XRT and UVOT data revealed a
flux increase, although with smaller amplitudes, also in the X-ray and
optical/UV bands. The X-ray emission of 3C 454.3 is with a hard spectral index
of $\Gamma_{\rm X}=1.16-1.75$, and the flux in the flaring states increased up
to $(1.80\pm0.18)\times10^{-10}{\rm erg\:cm^{-2}\: s^{-1}}$. Through combining
the analyzed data, it was possible to assemble 362 high-quality and
quasi-simultaneous spectral energy distributions of 3C 454.3 in 2008-2018 which
all were modeled within a one-zone leptonic scenario assuming the emission
region is within the broad line region, involving synchrotron, synchrotron
self-Compton and external Compton mechanisms. Such an extensive modeling is the
key for constraining the underlying emission mechanisms in the 3C 454.3 jet and
allows to derive the physical parameters of the jet and investigate their
evolution in time. The modeling suggests that during the flares, along with the
variation of emitting electron parameters, the Doppler boosting factor
increased substantially implying that the emission in these periods has most
likely originated in a faster moving region.

  with AMS-02","24 pages, 9 figures",,,,astro-ph.HE,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The AMS-02 experiment has provided high-precision measurements of several
cosmic-ray (CR) species. The achieved percent-level accuracy gives access to
small spectral differences among the different species and, in turn, this
allows scrutinizing the universality of CR acceleration, which is expected in
the standard scenario of CR shock acceleration. While pre-AMS-02 data already
indicated a violation of the universality between protons and helium, it is
still an open question if at least helium and heavier nuclei can be reconciled.
To address this issue, we performed a joint analysis using the AMS-02 CR
measurements of antiprotons, protons, helium, helium 3, boron, carbon,
nitrogen, and oxygen. We explore two competing propagation scenarios, one with
a break in the diffusion coefficient at a few GVs and no reacceleration, and
another one with reacceleration and with a break in the injection spectra of
primaries. Furthermore, we explicitly consider the impact of the uncertainties
in the nuclear production cross-sections of secondaries by including nuisance
parameters in the fit. The resulting parameter space is explored with the help
of Monte Carlo methods. We find that, contrary to the naive expectation, in the
standard propagation scenarios CR universality is violated also for He, on the
one hand, and C, N, and O, on the other hand, i.e., different injection slopes
are required to explain the observed spectra. As an alternative, we explore
further propagation scenarios, inspired by non-homogeneous diffusion, which
might save universality. Finally, we also investigate the universality of CR
propagation, i.e., we compare the propagation properties inferred using only
light nuclei ($\bar{p}$, p, He, $^3$He) with the ones inferred using only
heavier nuclei (B, C, N, O).

extensively uses feature scoring methods for identifying which parts of the
input are the most important for a model to make a prediction (i.e. explanation
or rationale). However, previous research has shown that there is no clear best
scoring method across various text classification tasks while practitioners
typically have to make several other ad-hoc choices regarding the length and
the type of the rationale (e.g. short or long, contiguous or not). Inspired by
this, we propose a simple yet effective and flexible method that allows
selecting optimally for each data instance: (1) a feature scoring method; (2)
the length; and (3) the type of the rationale. Our method is inspired by input
erasure approaches to interpretability which assume that the most faithful
rationale for a prediction should be the one with the highest difference
between the model's output distribution using the full text and the text after
removing the rationale as input respectively. Evaluation on four standard text
classification datasets shows that our proposed method provides more faithful,
comprehensive and highly sufficient explanations compared to using a fixed
feature scoring method, rationale length and type. More importantly, we
demonstrate that a practitioner is not required to make any ad-hoc choices in
order to extract faithful rationales using our approach.

in existing super-resolution (SR) methods. To avoid the domain gap between
synthetic and test images, most previous methods try to adaptively learn the
synthesizing (degrading) process via a deterministic model. However, some
degradations in real scenarios are stochastic and cannot be determined by the
content of the image. These deterministic models may fail to model the random
factors and content-independent parts of degradations, which will limit the
performance of the following SR models. In this paper, we propose a
probabilistic degradation model (PDM), which studies the degradation
$\mathbf{D}$ as a random variable, and learns its distribution by modeling the
mapping from a priori random variable $\mathbf{z}$ to $\mathbf{D}$. Compared
with previous deterministic degradation models, PDM could model more diverse
degradations and generate HR-LR pairs that may better cover the various
degradations of test images, and thus prevent the SR model from over-fitting to
specific ones. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our degradation
model can help the SR model achieve better performance on different datasets.

The large-scale [O III] $\lambda5007$ \AA velocity field shows a superposition
of two disk kinematics: one similar to that of the stars and another along the

which probably originated from the capture of a dwarf galaxy, is moving inwards
and triggering an AGN, as supported by the local X-ray emission, which seems to
be the source of the H$_2$ 1-0 S(1) excitation. The fact that we see neither

  Variational Autoencoder based Collaborative Filtering",,,,,cs.LG stat.ML,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Matrix factorization (MF) has been widely applied to collaborative filtering
in recommendation systems. Its Bayesian variants can derive posterior
distributions of user and item embeddings, and are more robust to sparse
ratings. However, the Bayesian methods are restricted by their update rules for
the posterior parameters due to the conjugacy of the priors and the likelihood.
Variational autoencoders (VAE) can address this issue by capturing complex
mappings between the posterior parameters and the data. However, current
research on VAEs for collaborative filtering only considers the mappings based
on the explicit data information while the implicit embedding information is
overlooked. In this paper, we first derive evidence lower bounds (ELBO) for
Bayesian MF models from two viewpoints: user-oriented and item-oriented. Based
on the ELBOs, we propose a VAE-based Bayesian MF framework. It leverages not
only the data but also the embedding information to approximate the user-item
joint distribution. As suggested by the ELBOs, the approximation is iterative
with cross feedback of user and item embeddings into each other's encoders.
More specifically, user embeddings sampled at the previous iteration are fed to
the item-side encoders to estimate the posterior parameters for the item
embeddings at the current iteration, and vice versa. The estimation also
attends to the cross-fed embeddings to further exploit useful information. The
decoder then reconstructs the data via the matrix factorization over the
currently re-sampled user and item embeddings.

first extend the existing least squares (LS) ON/OFF channel estimation protocol

consider a low-complexity direct estimation (DE) scheme, where the BS obtains
the MMSE estimate of the overall channel in a single sub-phase. Under both

the RIS phases are studied in the large system limit, where we derive
deterministic equivalents of the signal- to-interference-plus-noise ratio

Rayleigh fading, the RIS phase-shift values do not play a significant role in
improving the sum-rate but the RIS still provides an array gain. However, under
Rician fading, we show that RIS provides both array and reflect beamforming
gains. A projected gradient ascent-based algorithm is used to optimize the
phase-shifts under both ON/OFF and DE protocol. Simulation results show that
the DE of the overall channel yields better downlink performance when

pair-interaction potential energy required in this framework to two-body
elastic scattering is based on the screened interaction energy between system
particles. In such an energetically optimized modeling the swift bare
projectile interacts with independent screened constituents of a fixed-density
interacting many-body target. The first-order Born momentum-transfer
(transport) cross section is calculated and thus a comparison with stopping
data obtained [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 26}, 2335 (1982)] by swift ions,
$Z_1\in{[9,17]}$ and $(v/v_0)\simeq{11}$, under channeling condition in Si is
made. A quantitative agreement between the elastic scattering-based theoretical
stopping and the experimentally observed reduced magnitude is found.
Conventionally, such a reduced magnitude for the observable is interpreted,
applying an equipartition rule, as inelastic energy loss mediated by a
collective classical plasma-mode without momentum transfer to the valence-part.
Beyond the leading, i.e., first-order Born-Bethe term ($Z_1^2$), the Barkas
($Z_1^3$) and Bloch ($Z_1^4$) terms are discussed, following the arguments of
Lindhard for screened interaction. An extension to the case of stopping of warm

muscle-to-machine-interfaces (MMI) and their application for e.g.
rehabilitation therapy. sEMG signals have high inter-subject variability, due
to various factors, including skin thickness, body fat percentage, and
electrode placement. Therefore, obtaining high generalization quality of a
trained sEMG decoder is quite challenging. Usually, machine learning based sEMG
decoders are either trained on subject-specific data, or at least recalibrated
for each user, individually. Even though, deep learning algorithms produced
several state of the art results for sEMG decoding,however, due to the limited
amount of availability of sEMG data, the deep learning models are prone to
overfitting. Recently, transfer learning for domain adaptation improved
generalization quality with reduced training time on various machine learning
tasks. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of transfer learning
using weight initialization for recalibration of two different pretrained deep
learning models on a new subjects data, and compare their performance to
subject-specific models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
that thoroughly investigated weight-initialization based transfer learning for
sEMG classification and compared transfer learning to subject-specific

various settings. On average over all settings, our transfer learning approach
improves 5~\%-points on the pretrained models without fine-tuning and
12~\%-points on the subject-specific models, while being trained on average
22~\% fewer epochs. Our results indicate that transfer learning enables faster
training on fewer samples than user-specific models, and improves the
performance of pretrained models as long as enough data is available.

state that is hidden, but from which information can leak. They are typically
represented as 3-way joint-probability distributions.
  We use HMM's as denotations of probabilistic hidden-state sequential
programs: for that, we recast them as `abstract' HMM's, computations in the
Giry monad $\mathbb{D}$, and we equip them with a partial order of increasing
security. However to encode the monadic type with hiding over some state
$\mathcal{X}$ we use $\mathbb{D}\mathcal{X}\to \mathbb{D}^2\mathcal{X}$ rather
than the conventional $\mathcal{X}{\to}\mathbb{D}\mathcal{X}$ that suffices for
Markov models whose state is not hidden. We illustrate the
$\mathbb{D}\mathcal{X}\to \mathbb{D}^2\mathcal{X}$ construction with a small
Haskell prototype.
  We then present uncertainty measures as a generalisation of the extant
diversity of probabilistic entropies, with characteristic analytic properties
for them, and show how the new entropies interact with the order of increasing
security. Furthermore, we give a `backwards' uncertainty-transformer semantics
for HMM's that is dual to the `forwards' abstract HMM's - it is an analogue of
the duality between forwards, relational semantics and backwards,
predicate-transformer semantics for imperative programs with demonic choice.
  Finally, we argue that, from this new denotational-semantic viewpoint, one
can see that the Dalenius desideratum for statistical databases is actually an
issue in compositionality. We propose a means for taking it into account.

  on Microarchitecture (MICRO 2021)",,,,cs.AR,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  State-of-the-art techniques for addressing scaling-related main memory errors
identify and repair bits that are at risk of error from within the memory
controller. Unfortunately, modern main memory chips internally use on-die error
correcting codes (on-die ECC) that obfuscate the memory controller's view of
errors, complicating the process of identifying at-risk bits (i.e., error
profiling). To understand the problems that on-die ECC causes for error
profiling, we analytically study how on-die ECC changes the way that memory
errors appear outside of the memory chip (e.g., to the memory controller). We
show that on-die ECC introduces statistical dependence between errors in
different bit positions, raising three key challenges for practical and
effective error profiling.
  To address the three challenges, we introduce Hybrid Active-Reactive
Profiling (HARP), a new error profiling algorithm that rapidly achieves full
coverage of at-risk bits in memory chips that use on-die ECC. HARP separates
error profiling into two phases: (1) using existing profiling techniques with
the help of small modifications to the on-die ECC mechanism to quickly identify
a subset of at-risk bits; and (2) using a secondary ECC within the memory
controller to safely identify the remaining at-risk bits, if and when they
fail. Our evaluations show that HARP achieves full coverage of all at-risk bits
faster (e.g., 99th-percentile coverage 20.6%/36.4%/52.9%/62.1% faster, on
average, given 2/3/4/5 raw bit errors per ECC word) than two state-of-the-art
baseline error profiling algorithms, which sometimes fail to achieve full
coverage. We perform a case study of how each profiler impacts the system's
overall bit error rate (BER) when using a repair mechanism to tolerate DRAM
data-retention errors. We show that HARP outperforms the best baseline
algorithm (e.g., by 3.7x for a raw per-bit error probability of 0.75).

fidelity to the underlying classifier for local explanation models which is
based on distances to a target decision boundary. A system called CLEAR:
Counterfactual Local Explanations via Regression, is introduced and evaluated.
CLEAR generates w-counterfactual explanations that state minimum changes
necessary to flip a prediction's classification. CLEAR then builds local
regression models, using the w-counterfactuals to measure and improve the
fidelity of its regressions. By contrast, the popular LIME method, which also
uses regression to generate local explanations, neither measures its own
fidelity nor generates counterfactuals. CLEAR's regressions are found to have
significantly higher fidelity than LIME's, averaging over 45% higher in this

systems which we have studied. These systems' light curves were derived from
observations made by the Transiting Light Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and
some ground-based telescopes. We used Exofast-v1 to model these light curves
and calculate mid-transit times. Also, we plotted TTV diagrams for them using
derived mid-transit times and those available within the literature. O-C
analysis of these timings enables us to refine the linear ephemeris of four
systems. We measured WASP-12's tidal quality factor based on adding TESS data
as Q*'=(2.13+-0.29)*10^5. According to the analysis, the orbital period of the
WASP-46 b system is increasing. The WASP-36 b and WASP-33 b systems have not
shown any obvious quadratic trend in their TTV diagrams. The increase in their
period is most likely due to inaccurate liner ephemeris that has increased over
time. So, more observations are needed to evaluate whether or not there is an
orbital decay in the WASP-36 b and WASP-33 b systems.

Photovoltaic (PV) inverters for providing voltage regulation on 3-phase
unbalanced distribution feeders. Voltage sensitivity studies are conducted to
uncover the dependency between nodal voltage changes and the reactive power
injections at nodes with smart PV inverters. A fast incremental clustering
method is developed to divide the distribution feeder into weakly coupled zones
based on correlations of nodal voltage sensitivities. Because each zone is
weakly coupled, voltage of each zone can be controlled independently. Thus, in
each zone, a rule-based voltage controller will dispatch PV smart inverters to
provide reactive power control for correcting the over/under voltages. An
actual distribution feeder in North Carolina is used as a test bed. Simulation
results show that the proposed zonal based Volt/VAR control mechanism can
maintain the voltage in the distribution system within limits and solves faster
than the centralized controller.

\emph{first-passage resetting}, where the resetting of a random walk to a fixed
position is triggered by a first-passage event of the walk itself. In an
infinite domain, first-passage resetting of isotropic diffusion is
non-stationary, with the number of resetting events growing with time as
$\sqrt{t}$. We calculate the resulting spatial probability distribution of the
particle analytically, and also obtain this distribution by a geometric path
decomposition. In a finite interval, we define an optimization problem that is
controlled by first-passage resetting; this scenario is motivated by
reliability theory. The goal is to operate a system close to its maximum
capacity without experiencing too many breakdowns. However, when a breakdown
occurs the system is reset to its minimal operating point. We define and
optimize an objective function that maximizes the reward (being close to
maximum operation) minus a penalty for each breakdown. We also investigate
extensions of this basic model to include delay after each reset and to two
dimensions. Finally, we study the growth dynamics of a domain in which the
domain boundary recedes by a specified amount whenever the diffusing particle
reaches the boundary after which a resetting event occurs. We determine the
growth rate of the domain for the semi-infinite line and the finite interval
and find a wide range of behaviors that depend on how much the recession occurs
when the particle hits the boundary.

models which allow to sample from class-conditional distributions. Existing
cGANs are based on a wide range of different discriminator designs and training
objectives. One popular design in earlier works is to include a classifier
during training with the assumption that good classifiers can help eliminate
samples generated with wrong classes. Nevertheless, including classifiers in
cGANs often comes with a side effect of only generating easy-to-classify
samples. Recently, some representative cGANs avoid the shortcoming and reach
state-of-the-art performance without having classifiers. Somehow it remains
unanswered whether the classifiers can be resurrected to design better cGANs.
In this work, we demonstrate that classifiers can be properly leveraged to
improve cGANs. We start by using the decomposition of the joint probability
distribution to connect the goals of cGANs and classification as a unified
framework. The framework, along with a classic energy model to parameterize
distributions, justifies the use of classifiers for cGANs in a principled
manner. It explains several popular cGAN variants, such as ACGAN, ProjGAN, and
ContraGAN, as special cases with different levels of approximations, which
provides a unified view and brings new insights to understanding cGANs.
Experimental results demonstrate that the design inspired by the proposed
framework outperforms state-of-the-art cGANs on multiple benchmark datasets,
especially on the most challenging ImageNet. The code is available at

survival. Common strategies for camouflage include background matching,
imitating the color and pattern of the environment, and disruptive coloration,
disguising body outlines [35]. Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to
segment camouflaged objects hiding in their surroundings. Existing COD models
are built upon binary ground truth to segment the camouflaged objects without
illustrating the level of camouflage. In this paper, we revisit this task and
argue that explicitly modeling the conspicuousness of camouflaged objects
against their particular backgrounds can not only lead to a better
understanding about camouflage and evolution of animals, but also provide
guidance to design more sophisticated camouflage techniques. Furthermore, we
observe that it is some specific parts of the camouflaged objects that make
them detectable by predators. With the above understanding about camouflaged
objects, we present the first ranking based COD network (Rank-Net) to
simultaneously localize, segment and rank camouflaged objects. The localization
model is proposed to find the discriminative regions that make the camouflaged
object obvious. The segmentation model segments the full scope of the
camouflaged objects. And, the ranking model infers the detectability of
different camouflaged objects. Moreover, we contribute a large COD testing set
to evaluate the generalization ability of COD models. Experimental results show
that our model achieves new state-of-the-art, leading to a more interpretable
COD network.

FGK stars may be modulated by surface ice coverage. To estimate its frequency
and locations, we simulated the climates of hypothetical planets with a 1D
energy balance model and assumed that the planets possess properties similar to
modern Earth (mass, geography, atmosphere). We first simulated planets with
fixed rotational axes and circular orbits, finding that the vast majority
(>90%) of planets with habitable surfaces are free of ice. For planets with
partial ice coverage, the parameter space for ice caps (interannual ice located
at the poles) is about as large as that for ""ice belts"" (interannual ice
located at the equator), but belts only persist on land. We then performed
simulations that mimicked perturbations from other planets by forcing
sinusoidal orbital and rotational oscillations over a range of frequencies and
amplitudes. We assume initially ice-free surfaces and set the initial
eccentricity distribution to mirror known exoplanets, while the initial
obliquity distribution matches planet formation predictions, ie favoring 90
degrees. For these dynamic cases, we find again that ~90% of habitable planets
are free of surface ice for a range of assumptions for ice's albedo. Planets
orbiting F dwarfs are three times as likely to have ice caps than belts, but
for planets orbiting K and G dwarfs ice belts are twice as likely as caps. In
some cases, a planet's surface ice can cycle between the equatorial and polar
regions. Future direct imaging surveys of habitable planets may be able to test
these predictions.

simulating dynamics on dense random matrix ensembles with translation-invariant
properties. Examples include the Gaussian ensemble, the Haar-distributed random
orthogonal ensemble, and their complex-valued counterparts. A ""direct"" approach
to the simulation, where one first generates a dense $n \times n$ matrix from
the ensemble, requires at least $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ resource in space and time.
The HD algorithm overcomes this $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ bottleneck by using the
principle of deferred decisions: rather than fixing the entire random matrix in
advance, it lets the randomness unfold with the dynamics. At the heart of this
matrix-free algorithm is an adaptive and recursive construction of (random)
Householder reflectors. These orthogonal transformations exploit the group
symmetry of the matrix ensembles, while simultaneously maintaining the
statistical correlations induced by the dynamics. The memory and computation
costs of the HD algorithm are $\mathcal{O}(nT)$ and $\mathcal{O}(nT^2)$,
respectively, with $T$ being the number of iterations. When $T \ll n$, which is
nearly always the case in practice, the new algorithm leads to significant
reductions in runtime and memory footprint. Numerical results demonstrate the
promise of the HD algorithm as a new computational tool in the study of
high-dimensional random systems.

  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5661975",,,,cs.PL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Contemporary proof assistants such as Coq require that recursive functions be
terminating and corecursive functions be productive to maintain logical
consistency of their type theories, and some ensure these properties using
syntactic checks. However, being syntactic, they are inherently delicate and
restrictive, preventing users from easily writing obviously terminating or
productive functions at their whim.
  Meanwhile, there exist many sized type theories that perform type-based
termination and productivity checking, including theories based on the Calculus
of (Co)Inductive Constructions (CIC), the core calculus underlying Coq. These
theories are more robust and compositional in comparison. So why haven't they
been adapted to Coq?
  In this paper, we venture to answer this question with CIC$\widehat{*}$, a
sized type theory based on CIC. It extends past work on sized types in CIC with
additional Coq features such as global and local definitions. We also present a
corresponding size inference algorithm and implement it within Coq's kernel;
for maximal backward compatibility with existing Coq developments, it requires
no additional annotations from the user.
  In our evaluation of the implementation, we find a severe performance
degradation when compiling parts of the Coq standard library, inherent to the
algorithm itself. We conclude that if we wish to maintain backward
compatibility, using size inference as a replacement for syntactic checking is
wildly impractical in terms of performance.

formulate the task of neural network architecture optimization as a graph space

  Power System Security",Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,,,,eess.SY cs.SY,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Ensuring reliable operation of large power systems subjected to multiple
outages is a challenging task because of the combinatorial nature of the
problem. Traditional approaches for security assessment are often limited by
their scope and/or speed, resulting in missing of critical contingencies that
could lead to cascading failures. This paper proposes a two-component
methodology to enhance power system security. The first component combines an
efficient algorithm to detect cut-set saturation (called the feasibility test
(FT) algorithm) with real-time contingency analysis (RTCA) to create an
integrated corrective action (iCA), whose goal is to secure the system against
cut-set saturation as well as critical branch overloads. The second component
only employs the results of the FT to create a relaxed corrective action (rCA)
to secure the system against post-contingency cut-set saturation. The first
component is more comprehensive, but the latter is computationally more
efficient. The effectiveness of the two components is evaluated based upon the
number of cascade triggering contingencies alleviated, and the computation
time. The results obtained by analyzing different case-studies on the IEEE
118-bus and 2000-bus synthetic Texas systems indicate that the proposed
two-component methodology successfully enhances the scope and speed of power
system security assessment during multiple outages.

pseudo-inputs and their corresponding posterior densities. Our method avoids
undesired data centralisation, reduces rising computational costs and allows
the transfer of learned uncertainty metrics after training. We exploit the
augmentation of high-dimensional integral operators based on the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between stochastic processes to introduce an
efficient lower bound under all the sparse variational GPs, with different
complexity and even likelihood distribution. The method is also valid for
multi-output GPs, learning correlations a posteriori between independent

strongly coupled region (SCR) based on eigenfrequency separation of the

coupling effect is dominant, leading to intra-cavity power oscillation between
these two modes in a periodic manner and non-identical variation of their
phases. In SCR, the mode coupling effect reduces gradually with nearly
identical characteristics of both the modes. We further verify our numerical
findings with the semi-analytical variational method, leading to an in-depth

polarization evolving state, and the polarization locked state with the help of
Stokes parameters and Jones vectors in WCR and SCR, respectively.

attention is their capacity to capture inter-task relationships. Current
approaches either only rely on weight sharing, or add explicit dependency
modelling by decomposing the task joint distribution using Bayes chain rule. If
the latter strategy yields comprehensive inter-task relationships modelling, it
requires imposing an arbitrary order into an unordered task set. Most
importantly, this sequence ordering choice has been identified as a critical
source of performance variations. In this paper, we present Multi-Order Network

uses a differentiable order selection based on soft order modelling inside
Birkhoff's polytope to jointly learn task-wise recurrent modules with their
optimal chaining order. Furthermore, we introduce warm up and order dropout to
enhance order selection by encouraging order exploration. Experimentally, we

based on their specific iteration strategies, thus lack a general recipe to
uniformly analyze the convergence behaviors of different gradient-based BLOs.
In this work, we formulate BLOs from an optimistic bi-level viewpoint and
establish a new gradient-based algorithmic framework, named Bi-level Descent
Aggregation (BDA), to partially address the above issues. Specifically, BDA
provides a modularized structure to hierarchically aggregate both the upper-

Theoretically, we establish a general convergence analysis template and derive
a new proof recipe to investigate the essential theoretical properties of
gradient-based BLO methods. Furthermore, this work systematically explores the
convergence behavior of BDA in different optimization scenarios, i.e.,
considering various solution qualities (i.e., global/local/stationary solution)

preserve their local-data privacy. One main challenge confronting practical FL
is that resource constrained devices struggle with the computation intensive
task of updating of a deep-neural network model. To tackle the challenge, in
this paper, a federated dropout (FedDrop) scheme is proposed building on the
classic dropout scheme for random model pruning. Specifically, in each
iteration of the FL algorithm, several subnets are independently generated from
the global model at the server using dropout but with heterogeneous dropout
rates (i.e., parameter-pruning probabilities),each of which is adapted to the
state of an assigned channel. The subnets are downloaded to associated devices
for updating. Thereby, FedDrop reduces both the communication overhead and
devices' computation loads compared with the conventional FL while
outperforming the latter in the case of overfitting and also the FL scheme with
uniform dropout (i.e., identical subnets).

  Tracking and More)",To be published in 2021 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP),,,,cs.CR,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We analyze the prandom pseudo random number generator (PRNG) in use in the
Linux kernel (which is the kernel of the Linux operating system, as well as of
Android) and demonstrate that this PRNG is weak. The prandom PRNG is in use by
many ""consumers"" in the Linux kernel. We focused on three consumers at the
network level -- the UDP source port generation algorithm, the IPv6 flow label
generation algorithm and the IPv4 ID generation algorithm. The flawed prandom
PRNG is shared by all these consumers, which enables us to mount ""cross layer
attacks"" against the Linux kernel. In these attacks, we infer the internal
state of the prandom PRNG from one OSI layer, and use it to either predict the
values of the PRNG employed by the other OSI layer, or to correlate it to an
internal state of the PRNG inferred from the other protocol.
  Using this approach we can mount a very efficient DNS cache poisoning attack
against Linux. We collect TCP/IPv6 flow label values, or UDP source ports, or
TCP/IPv4 IP ID values, reconstruct the internal PRNG state, then predict an
outbound DNS query UDP source port, which speeds up the attack by a factor of
x3000 to x6000. This attack works remotely, but can also be mounted locally,
across Linux users and across containers, and (depending on the stub resolver)
can poison the cache with an arbitrary DNS record. Additionally, we can
identify and track Linux and Android devices -- we collect TCP/IPv6 flow label
values and/or UDP source port values and/or TCP/IPv4 ID fields, reconstruct the
PRNG internal state and correlate this new state to previously extracted PRNG
states to identify the same device.

programs. For example, one can prove properties of a slow, specification
implementation, porting the proofs to an optimized implementation that behaves
the same. Without functional extensionality, proofs must relate functions that
are fully applied. When data itself has a higher-order representation, fully
applied proofs face serious impediments! When working with first-order data,
fully applied proofs lead to noisome duplication when using higher-order
functions.
  While dependent type theories are typically consistent with functional
extensionality axioms, refinement type systems with semantic subtyping treat
naive phrasings of functional extensionality inconsistently, leading to
unsoundness. We demonstrate this unsoundness and develop a new approach to
equality in Liquid Haskell: we define a propositional equality in a library we
call PEq. Using PEq avoids the unsoundness while still proving useful
equalities at higher types; we demonstrate its use in several case studies. We
validate PEq by building a small model and developing its metatheory.
Additionally, we prove metaproperties of PEq inside Liquid Haskell itself using

-- the generator and the discriminator -- that are jointly trained to generate
artificial data, such as images, from random inputs. The quality of these
generated images has recently reached such levels that can often lead both
machines and humans into mistaking fake for real examples. However, the process
performed by the generator of the GAN has some limitations when we want to
condition the network to generate images from subcategories of a specific
class. Some recent approaches tackle this \textit{conditional generation} by
introducing extra information prior to the training process, such as image
semantic segmentation or textual descriptions. While successful, these
techniques still require defining beforehand the desired subcategories and
collecting large labeled image datasets representing them to train the GAN from
scratch. In this paper we present a novel and alternative method for guiding
generic non-conditional GANs to behave as conditional GANs. Instead of
re-training the GAN, our approach adds into the mix an encoder network to
generate the high-dimensional random input vectors that are fed to the
generator network of a non-conditional GAN to make it generate images from a
specific subcategory. In our experiments, when compared to training a
conditional GAN from scratch, our guided GAN is able to generate artificial
images of perceived quality comparable to that of non-conditional GANs after
training the encoder on just a few hundreds of images, which substantially
accelerates the process and enables adding new subcategories seamlessly.

to correct fluxes for the change of effective rest-frame wavelengths of filter

becomes so large that typical broadband photometric bands shift into the
neighboring rest frame band. At $z=0.6-0.8$ the shift reaches two or even three
bands. Therefore, we need perform $k$-corrections from one observed bandpass to
another. Here we expand the methodology proposed by Chilingarian et al. (2010)
and fit cross-band $k$-corrections by smooth low-order polynomial functions of
one observed color and a redshift - this approach but without cross-band is
implemented as standard functions in {\sc topcat}, which can be used for

measurements for galaxies out to redshift $z=1$. We calculated standard and

  shrinking content horizons",,,,,cs.SI physics.soc-ph,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The global public sphere has changed dramatically over the past decades: a
significant part of public discourse now takes place on algorithmically driven
platforms owned by a handful of private companies. Despite its growing
importance, there is scant large-scale academic research on the long-term
evolution of user behaviour on these platforms, because the data are often
proprietary to the platforms. Here, we evaluate the individual behaviour of
600,000 Twitter users between 2012 and 2019 and find empirical evidence for an
acceleration of the way Twitter is used on an individual level. This manifests
itself in the fact that cohorts of Twitter users behave differently depending
on when they joined the platform. Behaviour within a cohort is relatively
consistent over time and characterised by strong internal interactions, but
over time behaviour from cohort to cohort shifts towards increased activity.
Specifically, we measure this in terms of more tweets per user over time,
denser interactions with others via retweets, and shorter content horizons,
expressed as an individual's decaying autocorrelation of topics over time. Our
observations are explained by a growing proportion of active users who not only
tweet more actively but also elicit more retweets. These behaviours suggest a
collective contribution to an increased flow of information through each
cohort's news feed -- an increase that potentially depletes available
collective attention over time. Our findings complement recent, empirical work
on social acceleration, which has been largely agnostic about individual user
activity.

with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), is one of the most powerful
methods for simulating astronomical images. However, current work is limited to
utilizing paired images with supervised translation, and there has been rare
discussion on reconstructing noise background that encodes instrumental and
observational effects. These limitations might be harmful for subsequent
scientific applications in astrophysics. Therefore, we aim to develop methods
for using unpaired images and preserving noise characteristics in image
translation. In this work, we propose a two-way image translation model using
GANs that exploits both paired and unpaired images in a semi-supervised manner,
and introduce a noise emulating module that is able to learn and reconstruct
noise characterized by high-frequency features. By experimenting on multi-band
galaxy images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Canada France
Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHT), we show that our method recovers global
and local properties effectively and outperforms benchmark image translation
models. To our best knowledge, this work is the first attempt to apply
semi-supervised methods and noise reconstruction techniques in astrophysical
studies.

News articles usually contain rich textual information, and PLMs have the
potentials to enhance news text modeling for various intelligent news
applications like news recommendation and retrieval. However, most existing
PLMs are in huge size with hundreds of millions of parameters. Many online news
applications need to serve millions of users with low latency tolerance, which
poses huge challenges to incorporating PLMs in these scenarios. Knowledge
distillation techniques can compress a large PLM into a much smaller one and
meanwhile keeps good performance. However, existing language models are
pre-trained and distilled on general corpus like Wikipedia, which has some gaps
with the news domain and may be suboptimal for news intelligence. In this
paper, we propose NewsBERT, which can distill PLMs for efficient and effective
news intelligence. In our approach, we design a teacher-student joint learning
and distillation framework to collaboratively learn both teacher and student
models, where the student model can learn from the learning experience of the
teacher model. In addition, we propose a momentum distillation method by
incorporating the gradients of teacher model into the update of student model
to better transfer useful knowledge learned by the teacher model. Extensive
experiments on two real-world datasets with three tasks show that NewsBERT can
effectively improve the model performance in various intelligent news

applies the dynamical response from physical systems to information processing.
However, the relation between computation performance and physical
parameters/phenomena still remains unclear. This study reports our progress
regarding the role of current-dependent magnetic damping in the computational
performance of reservoir computing. The current-dependent relaxation dynamics
of a magnetic vortex core results in an asymmetric memory function with respect
to binary inputs. A fast relaxation caused by a large input leads to a fast
fading of the input memory, whereas a slow relaxation by a small input enables
the reservoir to keep the input memory for a relatively long time. As a result,
a step-like dependence is found for the short-term memory and parity-check
capacities on the pulse width of input data, where the capacities remain at 1.5
for a certain range of the pulse width, and drop to 1.0 for a long pulse-width
limit. Both analytical and numerical analyses clarify that the step-like
behavior can be attributed to the current-dependent relaxation time of the
vortex core to a limit-cycle state. }

end-to-end CNN acceleration so-lutions either transform the diverse computation
into matrix/vector arithmetic, which loses data reuse op-portunities in
convolution, or introduce dedicated functional unit to each kind of layer,
which results in underutilization and high update expense. To enhance the
whole-life cost efficiency, we need an acceleration solution that is efficient
in processing CNN layers and has the generality to apply to all kinds of

proposes a full-stack implementation to support GCONV Chain. On one hand, the
results on seven var-ious CNNs demonstrate that GCONV Chain improves the

  Physical Review Fluids",,,,physics.flu-dyn,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We use laboratory experiments to investigate the entrainment of ambient fluid
into an axisymmetric turbulent plume that contains dense particles with a
settling velocity that is considerably smaller than the plume velocity. We
consider the effect of particle size, particle concentration, and the
orientation of the plume buoyancy flux - either in the same or opposite
direction to the particle buoyancy flux. When the plume buoyancy flux is in the
opposite direction to the particle buoyancy flux, entrainment into the plume
increases by up to 40%. The rate of entrainment increases linearly with the
ratio of particle buoyancy flux to fluid buoyancy flux but does not depend on
the particle size. In contrast, when the plume buoyancy flux is in the same
direction as the particle buoyancy flux, entrainment into the plume is
unaffected by the addition of particles. The observed increase in entrainment,
when the plume and particle buoyancy fluxes are in opposite directions, is
consistent with inertial clustering whereby particles are ejected from regions
of relatively high vorticity and accumulate in regions of relatively high
strain rate within the turbulent flow field. Regions with high particle
concentration can then experience convective instabilities that affect the
entrainment of ambient fluid into the plume. The differing behaviour observed
based on the plume buoyancy flux orientation is also consistent with the above
mechanism. Finally, based on the laboratory findings, we propose a new
expression for the entrainment coefficient to take into account the effect of
suspended particles of opposing buoyancy flux to the plume buoyancy flux.

Toeplitz graphs and, for $\Omega=[0,1]^d$, the considered class includes
$d$-level Toeplitz graphs. In the general case, the underlying sequence of
adjacency matrices has a canonical eigenvalue distribution, in the Weyl sense,
and it has been shown in the theoretical part of this work that we can
associate to it a symbol $\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{f}}$. The knowledge of the
symbol and of its basic analytical features provides key information on the
eigenvalue structure in terms of localization, spectral gap, clustering, and
global distribution. In the present paper, many different applications are

the practical use of the developed theory. Tests and applications are mainly
obtained from the approximation of differential operators via numerical schemes

of the circuit, such as bounded treewidth or pathwidth, to convert the circuit
to structured classes, e.g., deterministic structured NNFs (d-SDNNFs) or OBDDs.
In this work, we show how to connect the width of circuits to the size of their
structured representation, through upper and lower bounds. For the upper bound,
we show how bounded-treewidth circuits can be converted to a d-SDNNF, in time
linear in the circuit size. Our bound, unlike existing results, is constructive
and only singly exponential in the treewidth. We show a related lower bound on
monotone DNF or CNF formulas, assuming a constant bound on the arity (size of
clauses) and degree (number of occurrences of each variable). Specifically, any
d-SDNNF (resp., SDNNF) for such a DNF (resp., CNF) must be of exponential size
in its treewidth; and the same holds for pathwidth when compiling to OBDDs. Our
lower bounds, in contrast with most previous work, apply to any formula of this
class, not just a well-chosen family. Hence, for our language of DNF and CNF,
pathwidth and treewidth respectively characterize the efficiency of compiling
to OBDDs and (d-)SDNNFs, that is, compilation is singly exponential in the
width parameter. We conclude by applying our lower bound results to the task of
query evaluation.

and closely related to other solar phenomena like UV bursts or coronal jets.
Our aim is to address the current lack of inverted models and diagnostics of
surges as well as characterizing their plasma properties. We have analyzed
different surges related to UV bursts observed with the Interface Region
Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) on 2016 April. The mid- and low-chromosphere of the
surges are examined by getting their representative Mg II h&k line profiles
through the k-means algorithm and performing inversions on them using the STiC
code. We have studied the far-UV spectra focusing on the O IV 1399.8 and 1401.2
\r{A} lines, carrying out density diagnostics to determine the transition
region properties of these ejections. We have also used experiments performed
with the Bifrost code for comparisons. Thanks to k-means, we reduce the number
of Mg II h&k profiles to invert by a factor 43.2. The inversions of the
representative profiles show that the mid- and low-chromosphere of the surges
have temperatures mainly around T $=6$ kK at $ -6.0 \le \log_{10}(\tau) \le
-3.2$. For the electronic number density, $n_e$, and line-of-sight velocity,
$V_{\mathrm{LOS}}$, the most reliable results from the inversions are within $
-6.0 \le \log_{10}(\tau) \le -4.8$, with $n_e$ ranging from $\sim1.6 \times
10^{11}$ up to $10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$, and $V_{\mathrm{LOS}}$ of a few km
s$^{-1}$. We find, for the first time, observational evidence of enhanced O IV
emission within the surges, indicating that these phenomena have a considerable
impact on the transition region even in the weakest far-UV lines. The O IV
emitting layers show electron number densities from $2.5\times 10^{10}$ to
$10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$. The simulations provide theoretical support in terms of
the topology and of the location of the O IV emission of the surges.

paper, we propose a RIS phase shift and BS beamforming optimization technique
that minimizes the uplink transmit power of a RIS-aided IoT network. Key idea
of the proposed scheme, referred to as Riemannian conjugate gradient-based
joint optimization (RCG-JO), is to jointly optimize the RIS phase shifts and
the BS beamforming vectors using the Riemannian conjugate gradient technique.
By exploiting the product Riemannian manifold structure of the sets of
unit-modulus phase shifts and unit-norm beamforming vectors, we convert the
nonconvex uplink power minimization problem into the unconstrained problem and
then find out the optimal solution on the product Riemannian manifold. From the
performance analysis and numerical evaluations, we demonstrate that the
proposed RCG-JO technique achieves $94\%$ reduction of the uplink transmit
power over the conventional scheme without RIS.

Monitoring (SHM) has evolved through multiple eras of development during the
past decades. Nevertheless, there still exists a number of challenges facing
the current state-of-the-art approaches, both in the industry as well as in

to uncertainties, need for user-defined thresholds, and non-uniform response
across a sensor network. In this work, a novel statistical framework is
proposed for active-sensing SHM based on the use of ultrasonic guided waves.
This framework is based on stochastic non-parametric time series models and
their corresponding statistical properties in order to readily provide healthy
confidence bounds and enable accurate and robust damage detection via the use
of appropriate statistical decision making tests. Three such methods and
corresponding statistical quantities (test statistics) along with decision
making schemes are formulated and experimentally assessed via the use of three
coupons with different levels of complexity: an Al plate with a growing notch,
a Carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) plate with added weights to simulate
local damages, and the CFRP panel used in the Open Guided Waves project [1],
all fitted with piezoelectric transducers and a pitch-catch configuration. The
performance of the proposed methods is compared to that of state-of-the-art
time-domain damage indices (DIs). The results demonstrate the increased
sensitivity and robustness of the proposed methods, with better tracking
capability of damage evolution compared to conventional approaches, even for
damage-non-intersecting actuator-sensor paths. Overall, the proposed
statistical methods exhibit greater damage sensitivity across different
components, with enhanced robustness to uncertainty, as well as user-friendly
application.

of the array making the decoupling a very challenging task at ultra-high
fields. High impedance RF coils have demonstrated to be a prominent design
method to circumvent these coupling issues. However, inherent characteristics
of these coils have ramification on the B1 field efficiency and SNR or the
complexity of the design. In this work, we propose a hairpin RF coil, a simple
design based on high impedance technique that provides excellent decoupling
performance and superior RF magnetic field efficiency compared to the current

proposed hairpin RF coils, systematical studies on decoupling performance,
field distribution, and SNR are performed, and the results are compared with
those obtained from one high impedance RF coil namely self-decoupled RF coil.
To investigate the proposed hairpin RF coil design, a 7T 8-channel head coil
array using hairpin resonators is built and evaluated. The MR imaging results
in a cylindrical phantom obtained from the 8-channel array demonstrated a 13 %

  Images in OCT Scan",,,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Deep learning models tend to underperform in the presence of domain shifts.
Domain transfer has recently emerged as a promising approach wherein images
exhibiting a domain shift are transformed into other domains for augmentation
or adaptation. However, with the absence of paired and annotated images, most
domain transfer methods mainly rely on adversarial networks and weak cycle
consistency, which could result in incomplete domain transfer or poor adherence
to the original image content. In this paper, we introduce MDT-Net to address
the limitations above through a multi-domain transfer model based on perceptual
supervision. Specifically, our model consists of an encoder-decoder network,
which aims to preserve anatomical structures, and multiple domain-specific
transfer modules, which guide the domain transition through feature
transformation. During the inference, MDT-Net can directly transfer images from
the source domain to multiple target domains at one time without any reference
image. To demonstrate the performance of MDT-Net, we evaluate it on RETOUCH
dataset, comprising OCT scans from three different scanner devices (domains),
for multi-domain transfer. We also take the transformed results as additional
training images for fluid segmentation in OCT scans in the tasks of domain
adaptation and data augmentation. Experimental results show that MDT-Net can
outperform other domain transfer models qualitatively and quantitatively.
Furthermore, the significant improvement in dice scores over multiple
segmentation models also demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed method.

regions of the World in subsequent waves. There is, however, no consensus on
the origin of this pattern, which may originate from human behaviour rather
than from the virus diffusion itself. Time-honoured models of the SIR type or
others based on complex networks describe well the exponential spread of the
disease, but cannot naturally accommodate the wave pattern. Nevertheless,
understanding this time-structure is of paramount importance in designing
effective prevention measures. Here we propose a consistent picture of the wave
pattern based on the epidemic Renormalisation Group (eRG) framework, which is
guided by the global symmetries of the system under time rescaling. We show
that the rate of spreading of the disease can be interpreted as a time-dilation
symmetry, while the final stage of an epidemic episode corresponds to reaching
a time scale-invariant state. We find that the endemic period between two waves
is a sign of instability in the system, associated to near-breaking of the time
scale-invariance. This phenomenon can be described in terms of an eRG model
featuring complex fixed points. Our results demonstrate that the key to control
the arrival of the next wave of a pandemic is in the strolling period in
between waves, i.e. when the number of infections grow linearly. Thus, limiting
the virus diffusion in this period is the most effective way to prevent or
delay the arrival of the next wave. In this work we establish a new guiding
principle for the formulation of mid-term governmental strategies to curb
pandemics and avoid recurrent waves of infections, deleterious in terms of
human life loss and economic damage.

milestones in the computer vision field, while the high computation and memory
cost makes its propagation in industrial production difficult. Pruning, a
traditional model compression paradigm for hardware efficiency, has been widely
applied in various DNN structures. Nevertheless, it stays ambiguous on how to
perform exclusive pruning on the ViT structure. Considering three key points:
the structural characteristics, the internal data pattern of ViTs, and the
related edge device deployment, we leverage the input token sparsity and
propose a computation-aware soft pruning framework, which can be set up on
vanilla Transformers of both flatten and CNN-type structures, such as
Pooling-based ViT (PiT). More concretely, we design a dynamic attention-based
multi-head token selector, which is a lightweight module for adaptive
instance-wise token selection. We further introduce a soft pruning technique,
which integrates the less informative tokens generated by the selector module
into a package token that will participate in subsequent calculations rather
than being completely discarded. Our framework is bound to the trade-off
between accuracy and computation constraints of specific edge devices through
our proposed computation-aware training strategy. Experimental results show
that our framework significantly reduces the computation cost of ViTs while
maintaining comparable performance on image classification. Moreover, our
framework can guarantee the identified model to meet resource specifications of
mobile devices and FPGA, and even achieve the real-time execution of DeiT-T on
mobile platforms. For example, our method reduces the latency of DeiT-T to 26
ms (26%$\sim $41% superior to existing works) on the mobile device with

errors, thermal deformations real trajectory differs from desired ones. This
negatively affects the resulting quality of tomographic reconstruction. Neither

process. A similar problem of position refinement while observing different
images of an object from different angles is well known in robotics

the field are among its key characteristics, yet measurement of optical
chirality at dimensions beyond the diffraction limit has proven difficult. Here
we theoretically show that the chiral properties of light can be characterized
down to the nanometer scale by means of force detection. To measure the chiral
properties of a beam of given handedness at the nanoscale, we determine the
photo-induced force exerted on a sharp tip, which is illuminated first by the
beam of interest and second by an auxiliary beam of opposite handedness, in a
sequential manner. We show that the difference between the force measurements
is directly proportional to the chiral properties of the beam of interest. In
particular, the gradient force difference $\Delta\langle F_{grad, z}\rangle$ is
found to have exclusive correspondence to the time-averaged helicity density of
the incident light, whereas the differential scattering force provides
information about the spin angular momentum density of light. We further

compatible with the translational equivariance property of standard
convolutions, thus degrading performance. Instead, we propose to use spherical
convolutions. The resulting network, which we call OmniLayout performs
convolutions directly on the sphere surface, sampling according to inverse
equirectangular projection and hence invariant to equirectangular distortions.
Using a new evaluation metric, we show that our network reduces the error in

highly influenced by network properties such as latency, bandwidth, packet
loss, and jitter. For instance, an engineer might need to answer questions such
as: What is the impact of an increase in network latency in application
response time? How does moving a cluster between geographical regions affect
application throughput? How network dynamics affects application stability?
Answering these questions in a systematic and reproducible way is very hard,
given the variability and lack of control over the underlying network.
Unfortunately, state-of-the-art network emulation or testbeds scale poorly
(i.e., MiniNet), focus exclusively on the control-plane (i.e., CrystalNet) or
ignore network dynamics (i.e., EmuLab). Kollaps is a fully distributed network
emulator that address these limitations. Kollaps hinges on two key
observations. First, from an application's perspective, what matters are the
emergent end-to-end properties (e.g., latency, bandwidth, packet loss, and
jitter) rather than the internal state of the routers and switches leading to
those properties. This premise allows us to build a simpler, dynamically
adaptable, emulation model that circumvent maintaining the full network state.
Second, this simplified model is maintainable in a fully decentralized way,
allowing the emulation to scale with the number of machines for the
application. Kollaps is fully decentralized, agnostic of the application
language and transport protocol, scales to thousands of processes and is
accurate when compared against a bare-metal deployment or state-of-the-art
approaches that emulate the full state of the network. We showcase how Kollaps
can accurately reproduce results from the literature and predict the behaviour

increase using more reliable uncertainty estimates as unary potentials within a
Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is able to incorporate contextual

achieve domain adaptation in a semi-supervised manner, which requires less

strands a fraction of Theia's mantle into orbit, while Earth accretes most of
Theia and its momentum. Simulations show that this produces a hot, high angular
momentum, silicate-dominated protolunar system, in substantial agreement with
lunar geology, geochemistry, and dynamics. However, a Moon that derives mostly
from Theia's mantle, as angular momentum dictates, is challenged by the fact
that O, Ti, Cr, radiogenic W, and other elements are indistinguishable in Earth
and lunar rocks. Moreover, the model requires an improbably low initial
velocity. Here we develop a scenario for Moon formation that begins with a
somewhat faster collision, when proto-Theia impacts proto-Earth at ~1.2 $v_{\rm
esc}$, also around 45{\deg}. Instead of merging, the bodies come into violent
contact for a half-hour and their major components escape, a ""hit-and-run
collision."" N-body evolutions show that the ""runner"" often returns ~0.1-1 Myr
later for a second giant impact, closer to $v_{\rm esc}$; this produces a
postimpact disk of ~2-3 lunar masses in smoothed particle hydrodynamics
simulations, with angular momentum comparable to canonical scenarios. The disk
ends up substantially inclined, in most cases, because the terminal collision
is randomly oriented to the first. Proto-Earth contributions to the silicate
disk are enhanced by the compounded mixing and greater energy of a collision
chain.

turbulence at mesoscale even though the constituent particles move at Reynolds
number below unity. It is intensely debated whether such fluids possess an
effective temperature and obey fluctuation-dissipation relations (FDR) as they
are generally marred by a lack of detailed balance. In this letter, we answer
this question and report an exact expression of the effective temperature for a

are fundamentally memory-bound. For such workloads, data movement between
memory and CPU cores imposes a significant overhead in terms of both latency
and energy. A major reason is that this communication happens through a narrow
bus with high latency and limited bandwidth, and the low data reuse in
memory-bound workloads is insufficient to amortize the cost of memory access.
Fundamentally addressing this data movement bottleneck requires a paradigm
where the memory system assumes an active role in computing by integrating
processing capabilities. This paradigm is known as processing-in-memory (PIM).
Recent research explores different forms of PIM architectures, motivated by the
emergence of new technologies that integrate memory with a logic layer, where
processing elements can be easily placed. Past works evaluate these
architectures in simulation or, at best, with simplified hardware prototypes.
In contrast, the UPMEM company has designed and manufactured the first
publicly-available real-world PIM architecture. The UPMEM PIM architecture
combines traditional DRAM memory arrays with general-purpose in-order cores,
called DRAM Processing Units (DPUs), integrated in the same chip. This paper
presents key takeaways from the first comprehensive analysis of the first
publicly-available real-world PIM architecture. We provide four key takeaways

inference method for directed networks with co-evolving nodal processes that
solves the ill-posedness problem. The proposed method, large-scale kernelized
Granger causality (lsKGC), uses kernel functions to transform data into a
low-dimensional feature space and solves the autoregressive problem in the
feature space, then finds the pre-images in the input space to infer the
topology. Extensive simulations on synthetic datasets with nonlinear and linear

different facets of next generation networks. The challenges in creating a

techno-economics, politics and ethics. This white paper addresses their
fundamental research challenges in three key areas. Trust: Under the current
""open internet"" regulation, the telco cloud can be used for trust services only
equally for all users. 6G network must support embedded trust for increased
level of information security in 6G. Trust modeling, trust policies and trust
mechanisms need to be defined. 6G interlinks physical and digital worlds making
safety dependent on information security. Therefore, we need trustworthy 6G.
Security: In 6G era, the dependence of the economy and societies on IT and the
networks will deepen. The role of IT and the networks in national security
keeps rising - a continuation of what we see in 5G. The development towards
cloud and edge native infrastructures is expected to continue in 6G networks,
and we need holistic 6G network security architecture planning. Security
automation opens new questions: machine learning can be used to make safer
systems, but also more dangerous attacks. Physical layer security techniques
can also represent efficient solutions for securing less investigated network
segments as first line of defense. Privacy: There is currently no way to
unambiguously determine when linked, deidentified datasets cross the threshold
to become personally identifiable. Courts in different parts of the world are
making decisions about whether privacy is being infringed, while companies are
seeking new ways to exploit private data to create new business revenues. As
solution alternatives, we may consider blockchain, distributed ledger

participants is not modeled directly in the environmental model so that tracked
objects can split, merge or disappear. The Boids flocking algorithm is used to
model the interaction between road users on already tracked objects by applying
the movement rules (separation, cohesion, alignment) on the boids. This

As in the classical case, our definition is syntactic: we use an appropriate

the class of models defined by a partial theory. We demonstrate the
expressivity of such equational theories by considering a number of examples,
including partial combinatory algebras and cartesian closed categories.
Moreover, despite the increase in expressivity of the syntax we retain a
well-behaved notion of semantics: we show that our categories of models are
precisely locally finitely presentable categories, and that free models exist.

Radio Bursts (FRBs) have demonstrated similar narrow-band features while only
little has been observed in the giant pulses of pulsars. We report the

  towards COVID-19 vaccine in the Arab world",,,,,cs.SI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Background: Vaccination programs are effective only when a significant
percentage of people are vaccinated. However, vaccine acceptance varies among
communities around the world. Social media usage is arguably one of the factors
affecting public attitudes towards vaccines. Objective: This study aims to
identify if the social media usages factors can be used to predict attitudes
and behavior towards the COVID-19 vaccines among the people in the Arab world.
Methods: An online survey was conducted in the Arab countries and 217 Arab
people participated in this study. Logistic regression was applied to identify
what demographics and social media usage factors predict public attitudes and
behavior towards the COVID-19 vaccines. Results: Of the 217 participants,
56.22% of them were willing to accept the vaccine and 41.47% of them were
hesitant. This study shows that none of the social media usages factors were
significant enough to predict the actual vaccine acceptance behavior. Whereas
the analysis showed few of the social media usage factors can predict public
attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccines. For example, frequent social media
users were 2.85 times more likely to agree that the risk of COVID-19 is being
exaggerated (OR=2.85, 95% CI=0.86-9.45, p=0.046) than infrequent social media
users. Whereas participants having more trust in vaccine information shared by
their contacts are less likely to agree that decision-makers have verified that
vaccines are safe (OR=0.528, 95% CI= 0.276-1.012, p=0.05). Conclusion: The use
of social media and information shared on it may affect public attitudes
towards COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, disseminating correct and validated
information about COVID-19 and other vaccines on social media is important for
increasing public trust and countering the impact of incorrect and
misinformation.

robots to learn complex skills by trial-and-error. Despite numerous successes

almost zero explanation when they fail to perform the task. For these reasons,
the adoption of RL in industrial settings is not common. Behavior Trees (BTs),
on the other hand, can provide a policy representation that a) supports modular
and composable skills, b) allows for easy interpretation of the robot actions,
and c) provides an advantageous low-dimensional parameter space. In this paper,
we present a novel algorithm that can learn the parameters of a BT policy in
simulation and then generalize to the physical robot without any additional
training. We leverage a physical simulator with a digital twin of our

significant tension between the predictions for such maximum masses, with
GW170817 suggesting that $M_{_{\rm TOV}} \lesssim 2.3\,M_{\odot}$, and GW190814
requiring $M_{_{\rm TOV}} \gtrsim 2.5\,M_{\odot}$ if the secondary was a (non-

sample the multidimensional space of parameters spanned by gravitational-wave

emission that are well above the numerical-relativity estimates, but they also

addition to conflicts in the spatial domain (i.e. spatially misaligned
stimuli), we consider gender-specific conflicts with male and female avatars.
Our results suggest that while semantically related stimuli affect the
magnitude of the visual bias (perceptually shifting the location of the sound
towards a semantically congruent visual cue), humans still strongly rely on
environmental statistics to solve AV conflicts. Together with previously
reported results, this work contributes to a better understanding of how

the major steps of quasi-static ultrasound elastography, which detects tissue
pathology by estimating its mechanical properties. Regularized
optimization-based techniques, a prominent class of TDE algorithms, optimize a
non-linear energy functional consisting of data constancy and spatial
continuity constraints to obtain the displacement and strain maps between the
time-series frames under consideration. The existing optimization-based TDE
methods often consider the L2-norm of displacement derivatives to construct the
regularizer. However, such a formulation over-penalizes the displacement
irregularity and poses two major issues to the estimated strain field. First,
the boundaries between different tissues are blurred. Second, the visual
contrast between the target and the background is suboptimal. To resolve these
issues, herein, we propose a novel TDE algorithm where instead of L2-, L1-norms
of both first- and second-order displacement derivatives are taken into account
to devise the continuity functional. We handle the non-differentiability of
L1-norm by smoothing the absolute value function's sharp corner and optimize
the resulting cost function in an iterative manner. We call our technique
Second-Order Ultrasound eLastography with L1-norm spatial regularization
(L1-SOUL). In terms of both sharpness and visual contrast, L1-SOUL

2103.07668,Omri Armstrong,"Omri Armstrong, Ran Gilad-Bachrach",Robust Model Compression Using Deep Hypotheses,,,,,cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Machine Learning models should ideally be compact and robust. Compactness
provides efficiency and comprehensibility whereas robustness provides
resilience. Both topics have been studied in recent years but in isolation.
Here we present a robust model compression scheme which is independent of model
types: it can compress ensembles, neural networks and other types of models
into diverse types of small models. The main building block is the notion of
depth derived from robust statistics. Originally, depth was introduced as a
measure of the centrality of a point in a sample such that the median is the
deepest point. This concept was extended to classification functions which
makes it possible to define the depth of a hypothesis and the median
hypothesis. Algorithms have been suggested to approximate the median but they
have been limited to binary classification. In this study, we present a new
algorithm, the Multiclass Empirical Median Optimization (MEMO) algorithm that
finds a deep hypothesis in multi-class tasks, and prove its correctness. This
leads to our Compact Robust Estimated Median Belief Optimization (CREMBO)
algorithm for robust model compression. We demonstrate the success of this
algorithm empirically by compressing neural networks and random forests into
small decision trees, which are interpretable models, and show that they are
more accurate and robust than other comparable methods. In addition, our
empirical study shows that our method outperforms Knowledge Distillation on DNN
to DNN compression.

protection of computer networks against increasingly frequent and sophisticated
cyber attacks. Recently, a lot of research effort has been dedicated to the
development of Machine Learning (ML) based NIDSs. As in any ML-based
application, the availability of high-quality datasets is critical for the
training and evaluation of ML-based NIDS. One of the key problems with the
currently available datasets is the lack of a standard feature set. The use of
a unique and proprietary set of features for each of the publicly available
datasets makes it virtually impossible to compare the performance of ML-based
traffic classifiers on different datasets, and hence to evaluate the ability of
these systems to generalise across different network scenarios. To address that
limitation, this paper proposes and evaluates standard NIDS feature sets based
on the NetFlow network meta-data collection protocol and system. We evaluate
and compare two NetFlow-based feature set variants, a version with 12 features,
and another one with 43 features.

representations of word embeddings. Word embedding helps to transfer knowledge
learned from readily available unlabelled data for improving task-specific
performance in low-resource setting. Last decade, there has been much
excitement in the field of digitization of Sanskrit. To effectively use such
readily available resources, it is very much essential to perform a systematic
study on word embedding approaches for the Sanskrit language. In this work, we
investigate the effectiveness of word embeddings. We classify word embeddings
in broad categories to facilitate systematic experimentation and evaluate them
on four intrinsic tasks. We investigate the efficacy of embeddings approaches
(originally proposed for languages other than Sanskrit) for Sanskrit along with
various challenges posed by language.

planetary signal had not been noticed before. The planetary system has a
planet-host mass ratio of $q = (1.25 \pm 0.13) \times 10^{-5}$. A Bayesian
analysis yields estimates of the mass of the host star, $M_{\rm host} =
0.61_{-0.24}^{+0.29}~M_\odot$, the mass of its planet, $M_{\rm planet} =

Based on density functional theory, we employ machine learning based molecular
dynamics to model sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and sodium bromide
solutions at different concentrations. The resulting reciprocal-space structure
factors agree quantitatively with neutron diffraction data. Here we provide
clear evidence that the ions in salt water do not distort the structure of
water in the same way as neat water responds to elevated pressure. Rather, the
computed structural changes are restricted to the ionic first solvation shells
intruding into the hydrogen bond network, beyond which the oxygen
radial-distribution function does not undergo major change relative to neat
water. Our findings suggest that the widely cited pressure-like effect on the
solvent in Hofmeister series ionic solutions should be carefully revisited.

length scales ranging from geometrical shapes of living organisms to protein
and DNA molecules. Interaction of chiral matter with chiral light - that is,
electromagnetic field possessing a certain handedness - underlies our ability
to discriminate enantiomers of chiral molecules. In this context, it is often
desired to have an optical cavity that efficiently couples to only a specific
(right or left) molecular enantiomer, and does not couple to the opposite one.
Here, we demonstrate a single-handedness chiral optical cavity supporting only
an eigenmode of a given handedness and lacking modes having the opposite one.
Resonant excitation of the cavity with light of appropriate handedness enables
formation of a helical standing wave with a uniform chirality density, while
the light of opposite handedness does not cause any resonant effects.
Furthermore, only chiral emitters of the matching handedness efficiently
interact with such a chiral eigenmode, enabling the handedness-selective
strength of light-matter coupling. The proposed system expands the set of tools
available for investigations of chiral matter and opens the door to studies of
chiral electromagnetic vacuum.

stochastic GW background lies in the $95\%$ confidence region of the GW signal
probed by NANOGrav collaboration. This is the case when the generated

controversies about the harms of digital technology, discourses and practices

in practice suffers from several significant limitations: tech ethics is vague
and toothless, has a myopic focus on individual engineers and technology
design, and is subsumed into corporate logics and incentives. These limitations
suggest that tech ethics enables corporate ""ethics-washing"": embracing the
language of ethics to defuse criticism and resist government regulation,
without committing to ethical behavior. Given these dynamics, I describe tech
ethics as a terrain of contestation where the central debate is not whether
ethics is desirable, but what ""ethics"" entails and who gets to define it.
Current approaches to tech ethics are poised to enable technologists and
technology companies to label themselves as ""ethical"" without substantively
altering their practices. Thus, those striving for structural improvements in
digital technologies must be mindful of the gap between ethics as a mode of
normative inquiry and ethics as a practical endeavor. In order to better
evaluate the opportunities and limits of tech ethics, I propose a
sociotechnical approach that analyzes tech ethics in light of who defines it
and what impacts it generates in practice.

  Cause Extraction",ACL2021 Main Conference Long paper,,,,cs.CL cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The Emotion Cause Extraction (ECE)} task aims to identify clauses which
contain emotion-evoking information for a particular emotion expressed in text.
We observe that a widely-used ECE dataset exhibits a bias that the majority of
annotated cause clauses are either directly before their associated emotion
clauses or are the emotion clauses themselves. Existing models for ECE tend to
explore such relative position information and suffer from the dataset bias. To
investigate the degree of reliance of existing ECE models on clause relative
positions, we propose a novel strategy to generate adversarial examples in
which the relative position information is no longer the indicative feature of
cause clauses. We test the performance of existing models on such adversarial
examples and observe a significant performance drop. To address the dataset
bias, we propose a novel graph-based method to explicitly model the emotion
triggering paths by leveraging the commonsense knowledge to enhance the
semantic dependencies between a candidate clause and an emotion clause.
Experimental results show that our proposed approach performs on par with the
existing state-of-the-art methods on the original ECE dataset, and is more
robust against adversarial attacks compared to existing models.

  using Cycle GANs",,,,,q-bio.QM physics.med-ph,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  As a means to extract biomarkers from medical imaging, radiomics has
attracted increased attention from researchers. However, reproducibility and
performance of radiomics in low dose CT scans are still poor, mostly due to
noise. Deep learning generative models can be used to denoise these images and
in turn improve radiomics' reproducibility and performance. However, most
generative models are trained on paired data, which can be difficult or
impossible to collect. In this article, we investigate the possibility of
denoising low dose CTs using cycle generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
improve radiomics reproducibility and performance based on unpaired datasets.
Two cycle GANs were trained: 1) from paired data, by simulating low dose CTs
(i.e., introducing noise) from high dose CTs; and 2) from unpaired real low
dose CTs. To accelerate convergence, during GAN training, a slice-paired
training strategy was introduced. The trained GANs were applied to three
scenarios: 1) improving radiomics reproducibility in simulated low dose CT
images and 2) same-day repeat low dose CTs (RIDER dataset) and 3) improving
radiomics performance in survival prediction. Cycle GAN results were compared
with a conditional GAN (CGAN) and an encoder-decoder network (EDN) trained on
simulated paired data.The cycle GAN trained on simulated data improved
concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) of radiomic features from 0.87 to
0.93 on simulated noise CT and from 0.89 to 0.92 on RIDER dataset, as well
improving the AUC of survival prediction from 0.52 to 0.59. The cycle GAN
trained on real data increased the CCCs of features in RIDER to 0.95 and the
AUC of survival prediction to 0.58. The results show that cycle GANs trained on
both simulated and real data can improve radiomics' reproducibility and
performance in low dose CT and achieve similar results compared to CGANs and
EDNs.

  State",submitted to ApJ,,,,astro-ph.CO astro-ph.HE,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) are more nearly standard candles when measured in
the near-infrared (NIR) than in the optical. With this motivation, from
2012-2017 we embarked on the RAISIN program with the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) to obtain rest-frame NIR light curves for a cosmologically distant sample
of 37 SN Ia ($0.2<z<0.7$) discovered by Pan-STARRS and the Dark Energy Survey.
By comparing higher-$z$ HST data with 43 SN Ia at $z<0.1$ observed in the NIR
by the Carnegie Supernova Project, we construct a Hubble diagram exclusively
from NIR observations to pursue a unique avenue to constrain the dark energy
equation of state parameter, $w$. We analyze the dependence of the full set of
Hubble residuals on the SN Ia host galaxy mass and find Hubble residual steps
of size $\sim$0.08-0.12 mag with 2- to 3-$\sigma$ significance depending on the
method and step location used. Combining our NIR sample with Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) constraints, we find $1+w=-0.04\pm0.12$
(statistical$+$systematic errors). The largest systematic errors are the
redshift-dependent SN selection biases and the properties of the NIR mass step.
We also use these data to measure ${\rm H}_0=75.4\pm 2.4~{\rm
km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ from stars with geometric distance calibration in the
hosts of 8 SNe Ia observed in the NIR versus ${\rm H}_0=65.9\pm3.4~{\rm
km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ using an inverse distance ladder approach tied to Planck.
Using optical data we find $1+w=-0.01\pm0.09$ and with optical and NIR data
combined, we find $1+w=0.03\pm0.08$; these shifts of up to $\sim$0.07 in $w$
could point to inconsistency in the optical versus NIR SN models. There will be
many opportunities to improve this NIR measurement and better understand
systematic uncertainties through larger low-$z$ samples, new light-curve
models, calibration improvements, and eventually building high-$z$ samples from
the Roman Space Telescope.

However, factors like vague boundaries or small regions dissociated from viable

multi-scale features in various vision-related tasks, we present a
structure-aware scale-adaptive feature selection method for efficient and
accurate cancer segmentation. Based on a segmentation network with a popular
encoder-decoder architecture, a scale-adaptive module is proposed for selecting
more robust features to represent the vague, non-rigid boundaries. Furthermore,
a structural similarity metric is proposed for better tissue structure
awareness to deal with small region segmentation. In addition, advanced designs
including several attention mechanisms and the selective-kernel convolutions
are applied to the baseline network for comparative study purposes. Extensive
experimental results show that the proposed structure-aware scale-adaptive
networks achieve outstanding performance on liver cancer segmentation when
compared to top ten submitted results in the challenge of PAIP 2019. Further
evaluation on colorectal cancer segmentation shows that the scale-adaptive
module improves the baseline network or outperforms the other excellent designs
of attention mechanisms when considering the tradeoff between efficiency and
accuracy.

governmental and public sectors, such as power and energy - which serve as
critical infrastructures for most societal operations. However, due to the
requirements of reliability, accountability, and explainability, it is risky to
directly apply AI-based methods to power systems because society cannot afford
cascading failures and large-scale blackouts, which easily cost billions of
dollars. To meet society requirements, this paper proposes a methodology to
develop, deploy, and evaluate AI systems in the energy sector by: (1)
understanding the power system measurements with physics, (2) designing AI
algorithms to forecast the need, (3) developing robust and accountable AI
methods, and (4) creating reliable measures to evaluate the performance of the
AI model. The goal is to provide a high level of confidence to energy utility
users. For illustration purposes, the paper uses power system event forecasting
(PEF) as an example, which carefully analyzes synchrophasor patterns measured
by the Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). Such a physical understanding leads to
a data-driven framework that reduces the dimensionality with physics and
forecasts the event with high credibility. Specifically, for dimensionality
reduction, machine learning arranges physical information from different
dimensions, resulting inefficient information extraction. For event
forecasting, the supervised learning model fuses the results of different
models to increase the confidence. Finally, comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the high accuracy, efficiency, and reliability as compared to other
state-of-the-art machine learning methods.

produce the optimized adversarial example, i.e., similarity-based adversarial
attack. This technique applies to both white-box and gray-box attacks against

dissimilarity score. To validate the effectiveness of SGADV, we conduct
extensive experiments on face datasets of LFW, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ against
deep face recognition models of FaceNet and InsightFace in both white-box and
gray-box settings. The results suggest that the proposed method significantly
outperforms the existing adversarial attack techniques in the gray-box setting.
We hence summarize that the similarity-base approaches to develop the

measure of overall quality-i.e., the naturalness of an utterance-and so cannot
tell us where exactly synthesis errors occur. This can make evaluation of the
appropriateness of prosodic variation within utterances inconclusive. To
address this, we propose a novel evaluation method based on the Rapid Prosody
Transcription paradigm. This allows listeners to mark the locations of errors
in an utterance in real-time, providing a probabilistic representation of the
perceptual errors that occur in the synthetic signal. We conduct experiments
that confirm that the fine-grained evaluation can be mapped to system rankings
of standard MOS tests, but the error marking gives a much more comprehensive
assessment of synthesized prosody. In particular, for standard audiobook test
set samples, we see that error marks consistently cluster around words at major
prosodic boundaries indicated by punctuation. However, for question-answer

  Prediction and its Application to NaCl",Submitted to the Journal of Chemical Physics,,,,cond-mat.stat-mech,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Knowledge of the vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) properties of molten salts is
important in the design of thermal energy storage systems for solar power and
nuclear energy production applications. The high temperatures involved make
their experimental determination problematic, and the development of both
macroscopic thermodynamic correlations and predictive molecular-based
methodologies are complicated by the requirement to appropriately incorporate
the chemically reacting vapor-phase species. We derive a general
thermodynamic-based atomistic simulation framework for molten salt VLE
prediction and show its application to NaCl. Its input quantities are
temperature-dependent ideal-gas free energy data for the vapor phase reactions,
and density and residual chemical potential data for the liquid. If these are
not available experimentally, the former may be predicted using standard
electronic structure software, and the latter by means of classical atomistic
simulation methodology. The framework predicts the temperature dependence of
vapor pressure, coexisting phase densities, vapor phase composition, and
vaporization enthalpy. It also predicts the concentrations of vapor phase
species present in minor amounts (such as the free ions), quantities that are
extremely difficult to measure experimentally. We furthermore use the VLE
results to obtain approximations to the complete VLE binodal dome and the
critical properties. We verify the framework for molten NaCl, for which
experimentally based density and chemical potential data are available in the
literature. We then apply it to the analysis of NaCl simulation data for two
commonly used atomistic force fields. The framework can be readily extended to
molten salt mixtures and to ionic liquids.

true for coverage on politics and related issues, where studies have shown that
bias in the news may influence elections and other collective decisions. Due to
its viable importance, news coverage has long been studied in the social

in-progress system for news recommendation that is the first to automate the
manual procedure of content analysis to reveal person-targeting biases in news
articles reporting on policy issues. In a large-scale user study, we find very
promising results regarding this interdisciplinary research direction. Our
recommender detects and reveals substantial frames that are actually present in
individual news articles. In contrast, prior work rather only facilitates the
visibility of biases, e.g., by distinguishing left- and right-wing outlets.
Further, our study shows that recommending news articles that differently frame
an event significantly improves respondents' awareness of bias.

best performing neural network architecture often used to tackle optimization
problems in the field of artificial intelligence. This paper utilizes the NEAT
algorithm to achieve competitive multiagent learning on a modified pong game

ultrasonic pulse-based IBCs, and SDSD can significantly improve bit-error rate

detection (ED) receivers. To overcome the high complexity and improve the BER
performance of SDSD, a splitting-detection joint-decision (SDJD) receiver is
proposed. The core idea of SDJD is to split the received signal into two steams
that can be separately processed by CD and ED, and then summed up as joint
decision variables to achieve diversity combining. The theoretical channel
capacity and BER of the SDSD and SDJD are derived for M-ary pulse position
modulation (M-PPM) and PPM with spreading codes. The derivation takes into
account the channel noise, intra-body channel fading, and channel estimation
error. Simulation results verify the theoretical analysis and show that both

criterion minimises overall output trajectory error across an utterance, rather
than minimising the error per frame independently, and thus takes into account
the interaction between static and dynamic features. The two techniques can be
easily combined to further improve performance. We present both objective and

particular, I use LISA's PISC to perform a systematic comparison of several

the optimal signal-to-noise ratio, (ii) allows for different power-law indices

confusion noise from compact binaries, and (iv) exhibits the dependence of the

features a parameter to represent the level of stress. It is known that people
choose different walking strategies when subjected to fear or stressful
situations. To demonstrate that our model for crowd dynamics could be used to

areas are often biased or prohibitively small. Researchers turn to methods such
as multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to improve the efficiency
of estimates by partially pooling data across areas via random effects.
However, the random effect approach can pool observations only through
area-level aggregates. We instead propose a weighting estimator, the synthetic
area estimator, which weights on variables measured only in the survey to
partially pool observations individually. The proposed method consists of
two-step weighting: first to adjust differences across areas and then to adjust
for differences between the sample and population. Unlike MRP, our estimator
can directly use the national weights that are often estimated from pollsters
using proprietary information. Our approach also clarifies the assumptions
needed for valid partial pooling, without imposing an outcome model. We apply
the proposed method to estimate the support for immigration policies at the

circumvention. Balboa provides a general framework for tunneling data through
existing applications. Balboa sits between an application and the operating
system, intercepting outgoing network traffic and rewriting it to embed data.
To avoid introducing any distinguishable divergence from the expected
application behavior, Balboa only rewrites traffic that matches an externally
specified \emph{traffic model} pre-shared between the communicating parties.
The traffic model captures some subset of the network traffic (e.g., some
subset of music an audio streaming server streams). The sender uses this model
to replace outgoing data with a pointer to the associated location in the model
and embed data in the freed up space. The receiver then extracts the data,
replacing the pointer with the original data from the model before passing the
data on to the application. When using TLS, this approach means that
application behavior with Balboa is \emph{equivalent}, modulo small
(protocol-dependent) timing differences, to if the application was running
without Balboa.
  Balboa differs from prior approaches in that it (1) provides a framework for
tunneling data through arbitrary (TLS-protected) protocols/applications, and
(2) runs the unaltered application binaries on standard inputs, as opposed to
most prior tunneling approaches which run the application on non-standard --
and thus potentially distinguishable -- inputs.
  We present two instantiations of Balboa -- one for audio streaming and one
for web browsing -- and demonstrate the difficulty of identifying Balboa by a
machine learning classifier.

first- and second- order correlation functions, and (3) determining the Schmidt
number of the entangled photons. The analytical expression derived for the

excellent performance to deal with hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis but,

readily applicable to out-of-sample data. A common assumption to deal with the
problem is that the transformation between the high-dimensional input space and
the (typically low) latent space is linear. This is a particularly strong
assumption, especially when dealing with hyperspectral images due to the
well-known nonlinear nature of the data. To address this problem, a manifold

proposed, which enables to present a nonlinear embedding function to project
out-of-sample samples into the latent space. The proposed method is compared to
manifold learning methods along with its linear counterparts and achieves
promising performance in terms of classification accuracy of a representative

for multiple pieces of evidence that characterize a patient case. This
typically includes at least the name of a condition and a genetic variation
that applies to the patient. Other factors such as demographic attributes,
comorbidities, and social determinants may also be pertinent. As such, the
retrieval problem is often formulated as ad hoc search but with multiple facets
(e.g., disease, mutation) that may need to be incorporated. In this paper, we
present a document reranking approach that combines neural query-document
matching and text summarization toward such retrieval scenarios. Our
architecture builds on the basic BERT model with three specific components for
reranking: (a). document-query matching (b). keyword extraction and (c).
facet-conditioned abstractive summarization. The outcomes of (b) and (c) are
used to essentially transform a candidate document into a concise summary that
can be compared with the query at hand to compute a relevance score. Component
(a) directly generates a matching score of a candidate document for a query.
The full architecture benefits from the complementary potential of
document-query matching and the novel document transformation approach based on
summarization along PM facets. Evaluations using NIST's TREC-PM track datasets
(2017--2019) show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. To

of which is initially excited. These forces derive from the time variation of
the longitudinal electromagnetic momentum. In contrast to the conservative
van-der-Waals forces, the nonconservative forces posses components orthogonal
to the interatomic axis. Thus, despite being several orders of magnitude
smaller than van-der-Waals', they might be accessible experimentally for the
case of two identical atoms. In addition, as with the van-der-Waals forces, the
nonconservative forces present nonreciprocal constituents which result in a net
force on the two-atom system. We offer an estimate of the spatial displacement
caused by the nonconservative forces on a binary system of Hydrogen atoms.

scenario in which a number of devices with low-complexity and low-energy wish
to upload their respective messages to a base station. In the original problem
formulation, all devices communicate using the same information rate. This may
be very inefficient in certain wireless situations with varied channel
conditions, power budgets, and payload requirements at the devices. This paper
extends the original problem setting so as to allow for such variability. More
specifically, we consider the scenario in which devices are clustered into two
classes, possibly with different SNR levels or distinct payload requirements.
In the cluster with higher power,devices transmit using a two-layer
superposition modulation. In the cluster with lower energy, users transmit with
the same base constellation as in the high power cluster. Within each layer,
devices employ the same codebook. At the receiver, signal groupings are
recovered using Approximate Message Passing(AMP), and proceeding from the high
to the low power levels using successive interference cancellation (SIC). This
layered architecture is implemented using Coded Compressed Sensing(CCS) within
every grouping. An outer tree code is employed to stitch fragments together
across times and layers, as needed.This pragmatic approach to heterogeneous CCS
is validated numerically and design guidelines are identified.

affected by the vector potential in regions without any electric or magnetic
fields [1]. The Aharonov-Bohm effect was experimentally confirmed [2-3] and has
been found in many situations [4-6]. A common explanation is based on quantum
mechanics, which states that the wavefunctions associated with the charges will
accumulate a phase shift due to the vector potential. However, consensus about
its nature and interpretation has not been achieved [7-14]. We here propose a
simple but reasonable interpretation based on the theory for electromagnetic
radiation and couplings [15]. The energy associated with a pulse radiator is
divided into a Coulomb-velocity energy and a radiative energy, together with a
macroscopic Schott energy accounting for the energy exchange between them. All
these energies are expressed with terms including the potentials, so are the
mutual coupling energies. There exists a force acting on the moving charges
even though the fields completely vanish. This force makes the charges pass
through the magnetic solenoid in different velocity with different path length,
causing a phase shift the same as that obtained with quantum mechanics. The
theory is originally aimed for providing an interpretation for electromagnetic
radiation and mutual coupling. It is derived directly from the Maxwell theory
with no modification but only substitution and reorganization.

Cavity-enhanced parametric down-conversion with Sagnac configuration is

entanglement in path and frequency is realized with high dimensions. On-chip
reconfiguration of the entanglement structure is also demonstrated. We further

have specific dependencies under that direction. The unification achieved by
direction successfully preserves the original dependency assumption used in AR

elliptical hosts, detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient
Survey (BTS). SN 2019ape is a SN Ic that exploded in the main body of a typical
elliptical galaxy. Its properties are consistent with an explosion of a regular
SN Ic progenitor. A secondary g-band light curve peak could indicate
interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar material (CSM). An
H$\alpha$-emitting source at the explosion site suggests a residual local star
formation origin. SN 2018fsh and SN 2020uik are SNe II which exploded in the
outskirts of elliptical galaxies. SN 2020uik shows typical spectra for SNe II,
while SN 2018fsh shows a boxy nebular H$\alpha$ profile, a signature of CSM
interaction. We combine these 3 SNe with 7 events from the literature and
analyze their hosts as a sample. We present multi-wavelength photometry of the
hosts, and compare this to archival photometry of all BTS hosts. Using the
spectroscopically complete BTS we conclude that $0.3\%^{+0.3}_{-0.1}$ of all
CCSNe occur in elliptical galaxies. We derive star-formation rates and stellar
masses for the host-galaxies and compare them to the properties of other SN

  Corresponding to a Lattice Displacement",,,,,hep-lat cs.NA math.NA,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Probing is a general technique that is used to reduce the variance of the
Hutchinson stochastic estimator for the trace of the inverse of a large, sparse
matrix $A$. The variance of the estimator is the sum of the squares of the
off-diagonal elements of $A^{-1}$. Therefore, this technique computes probing
vectors that when used in the estimator they annihilate the largest
off-diagonal elements. For matrices that display decay of the magnitude of
$|A^{-1}_{ij}|$ with the graph distance between nodes $i$ and $j$, this is
achieved through graph coloring of increasing powers $A^p$. Equivalently, when
a matrix stems from a lattice discretization, it is computationally beneficial
to find a distance-$p$ coloring of the lattice.
  In this work, we study probing for the more general problem of computing the
trace of a permutation of $A^{-1}$, say $PA^{-1}$, motivated from Lattice QCD
where we need to construct ""disconnected diagrams"" to extract flavor-separated
Generalized Parton functions. In Lattice QCD, where the matrix has a 4D
toroidal lattice structure, these non-local operators correspond to a $PA^{-1}$
where $P$ is the permutation relating to some displacement in one or more
dimensions. We focus on a single dimension displacement ($k$) but our methods
are general. We show that probing on $A^p$ or $(PA)^p$ do not annihilate the
largest magnitude elements. To resolve this issue, our displacement-based
probing works on $PA^p$ using a new coloring scheme that works directly on
appropriately displaced neighborhoods on the lattice. We prove lower bounds on
the number of colors needed, and study the effect of this scheme on variance
reduction, both theoretically and experimentally on a real-world Lattice QCD
calculation. We achieve orders of magnitude speedup over the un-probed or the
naively probed methods.

GCNs only consider the nodes that are a few propagations away from the labeled
nodes to classify them. However, taking only a few propagation steps away nodes
into account defeats the purpose of using the graph topological information in
the GCNs. To remedy this problem, the-state-of-the-art methods leverage the
network diffusion approaches, namely personalized page rank and its variants,
to fully account for the graph topology, {\em after} they use the Neural
Networks in the GCNs. However, these approaches overlook the fact that the
network diffusion methods favour high degree nodes in the graph, resulting in
the propagation of labels to unlabeled centralized, hub, nodes. To address this
biasing hub nodes problem, in this paper, we propose to utilize a
dimensionality reduction technique conjugate with personalized page rank so
that we can both take advantage from graph topology and resolve the hub node
favouring problem for GCNs. Here, our approach opens a new holistic road for
message passing phase of GCNs by suggesting the usage of other proximity
matrices instead of well-known Laplacian. Testing on two real-world networks
that are commonly used in benchmarking GCNs' performance for the node
classification context, we systematically evaluate the performance of the
proposed methodology and show that our approach outperforms existing methods
for wide ranges of parameter values with very limited deep learning training
{\em epochs}.

increased traction in the deep learning community. It combines deep neural
networks and evolutionary algorithms to improve and/or automate the
construction of neural networks. Recent Neuro-Evolution approaches have shown
promising results, rivaling hand-crafted neural networks in terms of accuracy.
A two-step approach is introduced where a convolutional autoencoder is created
that efficiently compresses the input data in the first step, and a
convolutional neural network is created to classify the compressed data in the
second step. The creation of networks in both steps is guided by by an
evolutionary process, where new networks are constantly being generated by
mutating members of a collection of existing networks. Additionally, a method
is introduced that considers the trade-off between compression and information
loss of different convolutional autoencoders. This is used to select the
optimal convolutional autoencoder from among those evolved to compress the data
for the second step. The complete framework is implemented, tested on the
popular CIFAR-10 data set, and the results are discussed. Finally, a number of
possible directions for future work with this particular framework in mind are
considered, including opportunities to improve its efficiency and its
application in particular areas.

dynamics are dominated by a marginally irrelevant operator which induces a
temperature dependent stiffness term. The numerical computations of OTOC
exhibit a non-zero Lyapunov exponent (LE) in a wide range of temperatures and
interaction strengths. The LE (in units of temperature) is a weakly

transfer simulation to produce data for the training data of neural networks.
Each neural network can be trained using $\sim 4000 - 5000$ samples. Compared
with the direct results of the Skirt simulation, our deep learning model
produces $0.1 - 0.2$ mag errors in FUV to FIR wavelengths. At some bands, the
uncertainty is only $0.01$ mag. As an application, we fit our model to the
observed SEDs of IC4225 and NGC5166. Our model can reproduce the observations,
and successfully predicts that both IC4225 and NGC5166 are edge-on galaxies.
However, the predicted geometry parameters are different from image-fitting
studies. Our analysis implies that the inconsistency is mainly due to the
degeneracy in the star formation history of the stellar disk and bulge. In
addition, we find that the predicted fluxes at $20 \, \rm \mu m - 80 \, \rm \mu
m$ by our SED model are correlated with bulge radius. Our SED code is public

double that of the next largest $z\sim 7$ survey. We combine two new LAGER

Disparate image pairs are deemed those that exhibit strong affine variations in
scale, viewpoint and projection parameters accompanied by the presence of
partial or complete occlusion of objects and extreme variations in ambient
illumination. Under these challenging conditions, neither local nor global
feature-based image matching methods, when used in isolation, have been
observed to be effective. The proposed correspondence determination scheme for
matching disparate images exploits high-level shape cues that are derived from
low-level local feature descriptors, thus combining the best of both worlds. A
graph-based representation for the disparate image pair is generated by
constructing an affinity matrix that embeds the distances between feature
points in two images, thus modeling the correspondence determination problem as
one of graph matching. The eigenspectrum of the affinity matrix, i.e., the
learned global shape representation, is then used to further regress the
transformation or homography that defines the correspondence between the source
image and target image. The proposed scheme is shown to yield state-of-the-art
results for both, coarse-level shape matching as well as fine point-wise
correspondence determination.

framework to investigate consensus dynamics on complex networks is naming

vocabulary evolution in a population of agents. However, in order to name an
object, agents must first be able to distinguish objects according to their
features. We articulate a likelihood category game model (LCGM) to integrate
feature learning and the naming process. In the LCGM, self-organized agents can
define category based on acquired knowledge through learning and use likelihood
estimation to distinguish objects. The information communicated among the
agents is no longer simply in some form of absolute answer, but involves one's
perception. Extensive simulations with LCGM reveal that a more complex
knowledge makes it harder to reach consensus. We also find that agents with
larger degree contribute more to the knowledge formation and are more likely to
be intelligent. The proposed LCGM and the findings provide new insights into
the emergence and evolution of consensus in complex systems in general.

The limitations of the computer model or what is known as the model-form

unsupervised learning problems. Latent variable models, such as variation
autoencoders and Gaussian mixture models, are often trained with
likelihood-based approaches. In scope of Goodhart's law, when a metric becomes
a target it ceases to be a good metric and therefore we should not use
likelihood to assess the quality of the fit of these models. The solution we
propose is a new metric for model comparison or regularization that relies on
moments. The concept is to study the difference between the data moments and
the model moments using a matrix norm, such as the Frobenius norm. We show how
to use this new metric for model comparison and then for regularization. It is
common to draw samples from the fitted distribution when evaluating latent
variable models and we show that our proposed metric is faster to compute and
has a smaller variance that this alternative. We conclude this article with a
proof of concept of both applications and we discuss future work.

dialects of the same language family in the presence of noise is a challenging
problem. In these scenarios, the identity of the language/dialect may be
reliably present only in parts of the temporal sequence of the speech signal.
The conventional approaches to LID (and for speaker recognition) ignore the
sequence information by extracting long-term statistical summary of the
recording assuming an independence of the feature frames. In this paper, we
propose a neural network framework utilizing short-sequence information in
language recognition. In particular, a new model is proposed for incorporating
relevance in language recognition, where parts of speech data are weighted more
based on their relevance for the language recognition task. This relevance
weighting is achieved using the bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)
network with attention modeling. We explore two approaches, the first approach
uses segment level i-vector/x-vector representations that are aggregated in the
neural model and the second approach where the acoustic features are directly
modeled in an end-to-end neural model. Experiments are performed using the
language recognition task in NIST LRE 2017 Challenge using clean, noisy and
multi-speaker speech data as well as in the RATS language recognition corpus.
In these experiments on noisy LRE tasks as well as the RATS dataset, the
proposed approach yields significant improvements over the conventional
i-vector/x-vector based language recognition approaches as well as with other
previous models incorporating sequence information.

thus undermining their reliability in practice. Quality Estimation (QE) is the
task of automatically assessing the performance of MT systems at test time.
Thus, in order to be useful, QE systems should be able to detect such errors.
However, this ability is yet to be tested in the current evaluation practices,
where QE systems are assessed only in terms of their correlation with human
judgements. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing a general methodology
for adversarial testing of QE for MT. First, we show that despite a high
correlation with human judgements achieved by the recent SOTA, certain types of
meaning errors are still problematic for QE to detect. Second, we show that on
average, the ability of a given model to discriminate between
meaning-preserving and meaning-altering perturbations is predictive of its
overall performance, thus potentially allowing for comparing QE systems without
relying on manual quality annotation.

  https://github.com/jackneustadt/disc-gifs",,,,astro-ph.GA astro-ph.HE,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We introduce a new model for understanding AGN continuum variability. We
start from a Shakura--Sunyaev thin accretion disc with a steady-state radial
temperature profile $T(R)$ and assume that the variable flux is due to
axisymmetric temperature perturbations $\delta T(R,t)$. After linearizing the
equations, we fit UV-optical AGN lightcurves to determine $\delta T(R,t)$ for a
sample of seven AGNs. We see a diversity of $|\delta T/T| \sim 0.1$ fluctuation
patterns which are not dominated by outgoing waves traveling at the speed of
light as expected for the ""lamppost"" model used to interpret disc reverberation
mapping studies. Rather, the most common pattern resembles slow ($v \ll c$)
ingoing waves. An explanation for our findings is that these ingoing waves
trigger central temperature fluctuations that act as a lamppost, producing
lower amplitude temperature fluctuations moving outwards at the speed of light.
The lightcurves are dominated by the lamppost signal -- even though the
temperature fluctuations are dominated by other structures with similar
variability time-scales -- because the discs exponentially smooth the
contributions from the slower ($v \ll c$) moving fluctuations to the observed
lightcurves. This leads to lightcurves that closely resemble the expectations
for a lamppost model but with the slow variability time-scales of the ingoing
waves. This also implies that longer time-scale variability signals will
increasingly diverge from lamppost models because the smoothing of
slower-moving waves steadily decreases as their period or spatial wavelength
increases.

Reissner-Nordstrom black hole with an external magnetic field. Such explicit
symplectic methods are still available when the Hamiltonian is separated into
five independently integrable parts with analytical solutions as explicit
functions of proper time. Numerical tests show that the proposed algorithms
share the desirable properties in their long-term stability, precision and
efficiency for appropriate choices of step sizes. For the applicability of one
of the new algorithms, the effects of the black hole's charge, the Coulomb part
of the electromagnetic potential and the magnetic parameter on the dynamical
behavior are surveyed. Under some circumstances, the extent of chaos gets
strong with an increase of the magnetic parameter from a global phase-space
structure. No the variation of the black hole's charge but the variation of the
Coulomb part is considerably sensitive to affect the regular and chaotic
dynamics of particles' orbits. A positive Coulomb part is easier to induce
chaos than a negative one.

Using crowdsourcing data collected by multiple agents appears to be much
potential for enhancing SLAM performance. However, the measurement
uncertainties in practice and biased estimations from multiple agents may
result in serious errors. This study develops a robust SLAM method with
measurement plug-and-play and crowdsourcing mechanisms to address the above
problems. First, we divide measurements into different categories according to
their unknown biases and realize a measurement plug-and-play mechanism by
extending the classic belief propagation (BP)-based SLAM method. The proposed
mechanism can obtain the time-varying agent location, radio features, and
corresponding measurement biases (such as clock bias, orientation bias, and
received signal strength model parameters), with high accuracy and robustness
in challenging scenarios without any prior information on anchors and agents.
Next, we establish a probabilistic crowdsourcing-based SLAM mechanism, in which
multiple agents cooperate to construct and refine the radio map in a
decentralized manner. Our study presents the first BP-based crowdsourcing that
resolves the ""double count"" and ""data reliability"" problems through the
flexible application of probabilistic data association methods. Numerical
results reveal that the crowdsourcing mechanism can further improve the

no longer drift inward to reach the snow line due to the back-reaction that
slows down radial velocity of pebbles. We show that the pile-up of solids

favored for $\alpha_{\rm Dr}/\alpha_{\rm acc} \ll 1$, while that of pebbles

classification problems using piecewise linear predictors over a polyhedral
partition of the feature space. The resulting algorithm that we call PARC
(Piecewise Affine Regression and Classification) alternates between (i) solving
ridge regression problems for numeric targets, softmax regression problems for
categorical targets, and either softmax regression or cluster centroid
computation for piecewise linear separation, and (ii) assigning the training
points to different clusters on the basis of a criterion that balances
prediction accuracy and piecewise-linear separability. We prove that PARC is a
block-coordinate descent algorithm that optimizes a suitably constructed
objective function, and that it converges in a finite number of steps to a
local minimum of that function. The accuracy of the algorithm is extensively
tested numerically on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that the
approach provides an extension of linear regression/classification that is
particularly useful when the obtained predictor is used as part of an
optimization model. A Python implementation of the algorithm described in this

are able to handle larger vocabulary and reduce the training time (for systems
with equivalent target language vocabulary size). In addition, we can produce
new words that are not in the vocabulary. We use a morphological analyser to
get a factored representation of each word (lemmas, Part of Speech tag, tense,

and a practical problem with tangible implications for societal health.
Population structure has long been recognized as a catalyst for cooperation
because local interactions enable reciprocity. Analysis of this phenomenon
typically assumes bi-directional social interactions, even though real-world
interactions are often uni-directional. Uni-directional interactions -- where
one individual has the opportunity to contribute altruistically to another, but
not conversely -- arise in real-world populations as the result of
organizational hierarchies, social stratification, popularity effects, and
endogenous mechanisms of network growth. Here we expand the theory of
cooperation in structured populations to account for both uni- and
bi-directional social interactions. Even though directed interactions remove
the opportunity for reciprocity, we find that cooperation can nonetheless be
favored in directed social networks and that cooperation is provably maximized
for networks with an intermediate proportion of directed interactions, as
observed in many empirical settings. We also identify two simple structural
motifs that allow efficient modification of interaction directionality to
promote cooperation by orders of magnitude. We discuss how our results relate
to the concepts of generalized and indirect reciprocity.

Regression with Laplacian Eigenmaps (PCR-LE), a method for nonparametric
regression based on Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE). PCR-LE works by projecting a
vector of observed responses ${\bf Y} = (Y_1,\ldots,Y_n)$ onto a subspace
spanned by certain eigenvectors of a neighborhood graph Laplacian. We show that
PCR-LE achieves minimax rates of convergence for random design regression over
Sobolev spaces. Under sufficient smoothness conditions on the design density
$p$, PCR-LE achieves the optimal rates for both estimation (where the optimal
rate in squared $L^2$ norm is known to be $n^{-2s/(2s + d)}$) and
goodness-of-fit testing ($n^{-4s/(4s + d)}$). We also show that PCR-LE is
\emph{manifold adaptive}: that is, we consider the situation where the design
is supported on a manifold of small intrinsic dimension $m$, and give upper
bounds establishing that PCR-LE achieves the faster minimax estimation
($n^{-2s/(2s + m)}$) and testing ($n^{-4s/(4s + m)}$) rates of convergence.
Interestingly, these rates are almost always much faster than the known rates
of convergence of graph Laplacian eigenvectors to their population-level
limits; in other words, for this problem regression with estimated features
appears to be much easier, statistically speaking, than estimating the features
itself. We support these theoretical results with empirical evidence.

mathematical description of the relationship between local-scale interactions
between highly autonomous sub-system components (individuals) and global-scale
behavior of the composite system (the collective). In this paper we use the
Active Inference Formulation (AIF), a framework for explaining the behavior of
any non-equilibrium steady state system at any scale, to posit a minimal
agent-based model that simulates the relationship between local
individual-level interaction and collective intelligence (operationalized as
system-level performance). We explore the effects of providing baseline AIF
agents (Model 1) with specific cognitive capabilities: Theory of Mind (Model
2); Goal Alignment (Model 3), and Theory of Mind with Goal Alignment (Model 4).
These stepwise transitions in sophistication of cognitive ability are motivated
by the types of advancements plausibly required for an AIF agent to persist and
flourish in an environment populated by other AIF agents, and have also
recently been shown to map naturally to canonical steps in human cognitive
ability. Illustrative results show that stepwise cognitive transitions increase
system performance by providing complementary mechanisms for alignment between
agents' local and global optima. Alignment emerges endogenously from the
dynamics of interacting AIF agents themselves, rather than being imposed
exogenously by incentives to agents' behaviors (contra existing computational
models of collective intelligence) or top-down priors for collective behavior
(contra existing multiscale simulations of AIF). These results shed light on
the types of generic information-theoretic patterns conducive to collective
intelligence in human and other complex adaptive systems.

peaks without any feature extraction. Moreover, We made signal images
multimodal and multidomain by converting them into time-frequency and frequency

experimental approaches. To achieve high internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs)
in metal-free organic light emitting diode via TADF, the first triplet (T1) to
first singlet (S1) reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) is promoted by
configuring molecules in an electron donor-acceptor (D-A) alternation with a
large di-hedral angle, which results in a small energy gap ({\Delta}EST)
between S1 and T1 levels. This allows for effective non-radiative up-conversion
of triplet excitons to singlet excitons that fluoresce. However, this
traditional molecular de-sign of TADF results in broad emission spectral bands
(full-width at half-maximum = 70-100 nm). Despite reports suggesting that
suppressing the D-A dihedral rotation narrows the emission band, the origin of
emission broadening remains elusive. Indeed, our results suggest that the
intrinsic TADF emission bandwidth is primarily determined by the charge
transfer character of the molecule, rather than its propensity for rotational
motion, which offers a renewed perspective on the rational molecular design of
organic emitters exhibiting sharp emission spectra.

data due to their ability to flexibly model the distribution of survival times.
These methods typically employ a nonparametric prior on the survival function

particularly in the presence of covariates, can be challenging and inference
typically relies on computationally intensive Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes.
In this paper, we build on recent work that recasts Bayesian inference as
assigning a predictive distribution on the unseen values of a population
conditional on the observed samples, thus avoiding the need to specify a
complex prior. We describe a copula-based predictive update which admits a
scalable sequential importance sampling algorithm to perform inference that
properly accounts for right-censoring. We provide theoretical justification

probability of detection as a function of the probability of false alarm, is a
key information-theoretic indicator of the difficulty of a binary hypothesis
testing problem (BHT). It is well known that the optimal ROC curve for a given
BHT, corresponding to the likelihood ratio test, is theoretically determined by
the probability distribution of the observed data under each of the two
hypotheses. In some cases, these two distributions may be unknown or
computationally intractable, but independent samples of the likelihood ratio
can be observed. This raises the problem of estimating the optimal ROC for a
BHT from such samples. The maximum likelihood estimator of the optimal ROC
curve is derived, and it is shown to converge to the true optimal ROC curve in
the \levy\ metric, as the number of observations tends to infinity. A classical
empirical estimator, based on estimating the two types of error probabilities
from two separate sets of samples, is also considered. The maximum likelihood
estimator is observed in simulation experiments to be considerably more

devices. Rather than porting drivers, we propose a novel approach to deriving
minimum viable drivers: developers exercise a full driver and record the
driver/device interactions; the processed recordings, dubbed driverlets, are
replayed in the TEE at run time to access IO devices.
  Driverlets address two key challenges: correctness and expressiveness, for
which they build on a key construct called interaction template. The
interaction template ensures faithful reproduction of recorded IO jobs (albeit
on new IO data); it accepts dynamic input values; it tolerates nondeterministic
device behaviors.
  We demonstrate driverlets on a series of sophisticated devices, making them
accessible to TrustZone for the first time to our knowledge. Our experiments
show that driverlets are secure, easy to build, and incur acceptable overhead
(1.4x -2.7x compared to native drivers). Driverlets fill a critical gap in the
TrustZone TEE, realizing its long-promised vision of secure IO.

  Semantic Segmentation",,WACV 2022,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Image-level weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) relies on class
activation maps (CAMs) for pseudo labels generation. As CAMs only highlight the
most discriminative regions of objects, the generated pseudo labels are usually
unsatisfactory to serve directly as supervision. To solve this, most existing
approaches follow a multi-training pipeline to refine CAMs for better
pseudo-labels, which includes: 1) re-training the classification model to
generate CAMs; 2) post-processing CAMs to obtain pseudo labels; and 3) training
a semantic segmentation model with the obtained pseudo labels. However, this
multi-training pipeline requires complicated adjustment and additional time. To
address this, we propose a class-conditional inference strategy and an
activation aware mask refinement loss function to generate better pseudo labels
without re-training the classifier. The class conditional inference-time
approach is presented to separately and iteratively reveal the classification
network's hidden object activation to generate more complete response maps.
Further, our activation aware mask refinement loss function introduces a novel
way to exploit saliency maps during segmentation training and refine the
foreground object masks without suppressing background objects. Our method
achieves superior WSSS results without requiring re-training of the classifier.

introduce uniaxial single-ion anisotropy and Heisenberg exchange anisotropy

parameters on the magnetization process, as well as on the specific heat of the

and magnetization jumps with magnetic ground-state phase transitions at low
temperature $T=1$K. The magnetization plateaus are strongly dependent on both
the levels of exchange anisotropy and single-ion anisotropy. Varying the former
leads to change in width and magnetic position of all intermediate plateaus
while they become wider upon increasing the latter. The specific heat of the
model manifests a Schottky-type maximum at moderate temperature in the presence
of weak magnetic fields, when the system is isotropic. The introducion of
aniostropy results in substantial variations in the thermal behavior of the
specific heat. Indeed, by tuning anisotropy parameters the Schottky peak
convert to a double-peak temperature dependence that coincided with the

self-dual noncommutative connective. The logic is defined by means of
proof-nets, rather than a sequent calculus. Later a deep inference system BV
was developed with an eye to capturing Pomset logic, but equivalence of system
has not been proven up to now. As for a sequent calculus formulation, it has
not been known for either of these logics, and there are convincing arguments
that such a sequent calculus in the usual sense simply does not exist for them.
In an on-going work on semantics we discovered a system similar to Pomset
logic, where a noncommutative connective is no longer self-dual. Pomset logic
appears as a degeneration, when the class of models is restricted. Motivated by
these semantic considerations, we define in the current work a semicommutative
multiplicative linear logic}, which is multiplicative linear logic extended
with two nonisomorphic noncommutative connectives (not to be confused with very
different Abrusci-Ruet noncommutative logic). We develop a syntax of proof-nets
and show how this logic degenerates to Pomset logic. However, a more
interesting problem than just finding yet another noncommutative logic is to
find a sequent calculus for this logic. We introduce decorated sequents, which
are sequents equipped with an extra structure of a binary relation of
reachability on formulas. We define a decorated sequent calculus for
semicommutative logic and prove that it is cut-free, sound and complete. This
is adapted to ""degenerate"" variations, including Pomset logic. Thus, in
particular, we give a variant of sequent calculus formulation for Pomset logic,
which is one of the key results of the paper.

long-time steady state. This manifestation of non-Markovian effects of the
environment forces the entropy to decrease in the later stage, which yields the

Q2138-431 is a gravitational lens. From early work, the two quasar images are
known to have almost identical spectra and redshifts, but no lensing galaxy has
so far been detected. In this paper we used recent deep surveys in infrared and
optical bands to search for the presence of a galaxy with the expected
properties of a gravitational lens. The search revealed a $5 \sigma$ detection
of a faint galaxy between the two quasar images on a deep $J$-band frame from
the VISTA Science Archive, with apparent magnitude $J = 20.68$. Non-detection
in the $I$-band implied a redshift $z > 0.6$, and mass modelling of the quasar
system gave a mass of $1.31 \times 10^{12} M_\odot$ for the lensing galaxy,
with mass-to-light ratio $M_{\odot}/L_{\odot} = 9.0$. Archival photographic
data from the UK 1.2m Schmidt telescope covering 25 years were used to
construct light curves for the two quasar images, which were then
cross-correlated to measure any time lag. This showed image B to lead image A
by around a year, consistent with 410 days from the mass model. Although the
similarity of the spectra and the detection of the lensing galaxy are the most
compelling arguments for the classification of Q2138-431 as a gravitational
lens, the time delay and mass-to-light ratio provide a consistent picture to
support this conclusion. The wide separation of the quasar images and the
simplicity of the mass model make Q2138-431 an excellent system for the
measurement of the Hubble constant.

with an ultrafast (2000 km/s or greater) halo coronal mass ejection (CME) and a
type II radio burst in the decameter-hectometric (DH) wavelengths. The SGRE
duration is linearly related to the type II burst duration indicating that >300
MeV protons required for SGREs are accelerated by the same shock that
accelerates tens of keV electrons that produce type II bursts. When
magnetically well connected, the associated solar energetic particle (SEP)
event has a hard spectrum, indicating copious acceleration of high-energy
protons. In one of the SGRE events observed on 2014 January 7 by Fermi/LAT, the
SEP event detected by GOES has a very soft spectrum with not many particles
beyond 100 MeV. This contradicts the presence of the SGRE, implying the
presence of significant number of >300 MeV protons. Furthermore, the durations
of the type II burst and the SGRE agree with the known linear relationship
between them (Gopalswamy et al. 2018, ApJ 868, L19). We show that the soft
spectrum is due to poor magnetic connectivity of the shock nose to an Earth
observer. Even though the location of the eruption (S15W11) is close to the
disk center, the CME propagated non-radially making the CME flank crossing the
ecliptic rather than the nose. High-energy particles are accelerated near the
nose, so they do not reach GOES but they do precipitate to the vicinity of the
eruption region to produce SGRE. This study provides further evidence that SGRE

algorithm achieves real-time detection with lower power consumption on embedded
devices, and it is difficult to balance the calculation speed and
identification ability. To this end, this paper collected and annotated a data
set named ""Aquarium Fish"" of 84 fishes containing 10042 images, and based on
this data set, proposed a multi-scale input fast fish target detection network
(BTP-yoloV3) and its optimization method. The experiment uses Depthwise
convolution to redesign the backbone of the yoloV4 network, which reduces the
amount of calculation by 94.1%, and the test accuracy is 92.34%. Then, the
training model is enhanced with MixUp, CutMix, and mosaic to increase the test
accuracy by 1.27%; Finally, use the mish, swish, and ELU activation functions
to increase the test accuracy by 0.76%. As a result, the accuracy of testing
the network with 2000 fish images reached 94.37%, and the computational
complexity of the network BFLOPS was only 5.47. Comparing the YoloV3~4,
MobileNetV2-yoloV3, and YoloV3-tiny networks of migration learning on this data
set. The results show that BTP-Yolov3 has smaller model parameters, faster
calculation speed, and lower energy consumption during operation while ensuring
the calculation accuracy. It provides a certain reference value for the
practical application of neural network.

formation in other systems, giving us new constraints on planet formation
processes. Meanwhile, studies of our own Solar System rely on constraints
derived in a completely different way. However, it is still unclear what
features the Solar System's disk could have produced during its gas phase. By
running 2D isothermal hydro-simulations and a dust evolution model, we derive
synthetic images at 1.3 mm wavelength using the radiative transfer code
RADMC3D. We find that the embedded multiple giant planets strongly perturb the
radial gas velocities of the disk, creating traffic jams in the dust. They
produce over-densities different from the ones created by pressure traps and
located away from the planets' positions in the disk. By deriving the images at
1.3mm from these dust distributions, we show that the traffic jams, observable
with a high resolution, further blur the link between the number of gaps and
rings in disks and the number of embedded planets. We additionally show that a
system of 3 compact giant planets does not automatically produce bright outer
rings at large radii in the disk. This means that high resolution observations
of disks of various sizes are needed to distinguish between different giant
planet formation scenarios during the disk phase, where the giants form either
in the outer regions of the disks or in the inner regions. Finally, we find
that, even when the dust temperature is determined self-consistently, the dust
masses derived observationally might be off by up to a factor of ten compared
to the dust contained in our simulations due to the creation of optically thick
regions. Our study clearly shows that in addition to the constraints from
exoplanets and the Solar System, ALMA has the power to constrain different
stages of planet formation already during the first few million years.

for 2D Large-Eddy Simulation. Optimal eddy viscosities depending on the
magnitude of the vorticity gradient are determined subject to minimum
assumptions by solving PDE-constrained optimization problems defined such that
the corresponding optimal Large-Eddy Simulation best matches the Direct
Numerical Simulation. The main finding is that with a fixed cutoff wavenumber
$k_c$, the performance of the Large-Eddy Simulation systematically improves as
the regularization in the solution of the optimization problem is reduced and
this is achieved with the optimal eddy viscosities exhibiting increasingly
irregular behavior with rapid oscillations. Since the optimal eddy viscosities
do not converge to a well-defined limit as the regularization vanishes, we
conclude that the problem of finding an optimal eddy viscosity is not in fact
well posed.

generates natural language under the prompts of video-content-relevant

captioning problem, we propose a novel Retrieve-Copy-Generate network, where a
pluggable video-to-text retriever is constructed to retrieve sentences as hints
from the training corpus effectively, and a copy-mechanism generator is
introduced to extract expressions from multi-retrieved sentences dynamically.
The two modules can be trained end-to-end or separately, which is flexible and
extensible. Our framework coordinates the conventional retrieval-based methods
with orthodox encoder-decoder methods, which can not only draw on the diverse
expressions in the retrieved sentences but also generate natural and accurate
content of the video. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show
that our proposed approach surpasses the state-of-the-art performance,
indicating the effectiveness and promising of the proposed paradigm in the task

spreading of disease especially when the medical resource is limited.In the
modern society, the information on epidemics transmits swiftly through various

Here we study on the identification of super-spreaders in the
information-disease coupled spreading dynamics. Firstly, we find that the
centralities in physical contact layer are no longer effective to identify
super-spreaders in epidemics, which is due to the suppression effects from the
information spreading. Then by considering the structural and dynamical
couplings between the communication layer and physical contact layer, we
propose a centrality measure called coupling-sensitive centrality to identify
super-spreaders in disease spreading. Simulation results on synthesized and
real-world multiplex networks show that the proposed measure is not only much
more accurate than centralities on the single network, but also outperforms two
typical multilayer centralities in identifying super-spreaders. These findings
imply that considering the structural and dynamical couplings between layers is
very necessary in identifying the key roles in the coupled multilayer systems.
