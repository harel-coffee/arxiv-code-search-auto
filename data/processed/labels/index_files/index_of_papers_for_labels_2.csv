  Guarantees","14 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables",,,,cs.DB,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Assisting end users to identify desired results from a large dataset is an
important problem for multi-criteria decision making. To address this problem,
top-k and skyline queries have been widely adopted, but they both have inherent
drawbacks, i.e., the user either has to provide a specific utility function or
faces many results. The k-regret minimization query is proposed, which
integrates the merits of top-k and skyline queries. Due to the NP-hardness of
the problem, the k-regret minimization query is time consuming and the greedy
framework is widely adopted. However, formal theoretical analysis of the greedy
approaches for the quality of the returned results is still lacking. In this
paper, we first fill this gap by conducting a nontrivial theoretical analysis
of the approximation ratio of the returned results. To speed up query
processing, a sampling-based method, StocPreGreed,, is developed to reduce the
evaluation cost. In addition, a theoretical analysis of the required sample
size is conducted to bound the quality of the returned results. Finally,
comprehensive experiments are conducted on both real and synthetic datasets to
demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methods.

utmost importance for enabling engaging and meaningful conversations with
users. Entity Linking (EL) is one of the means of text understanding, with
proven efficacy for various downstream tasks in information retrieval. In this
paper, we study entity linking for conversational systems. To develop a better
understanding of what EL in a conversational setting entails, we analyze a
large number of dialogues from existing conversational datasets and annotate
references to concepts, named entities, and personal entities using
crowdsourcing. Based on the annotated dialogues, we identify the main
characteristics of conversational entity linking. Further, we report on the
performance of traditional EL systems on our Conversational Entity Linking
dataset, ConEL, and present an extension to these methods to better fit the
conversational setting. The resources released with this paper include
annotated datasets, detailed descriptions of crowdsourcing setups, as well as
the annotations produced by various EL systems. These new resources allow for
an investigation of how the role of entities in conversations is different from
that in documents or isolated short text utterances like queries and tweets,
and complement existing conversational datasets.

  lead to overly-optimistic results","16 pages, 7 figures, two tables. Submitted to a journal",,,,cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  While open databases are an important resource in the Deep Learning (DL) era,
they are sometimes used ""off-label"": data published for one task are used for
training algorithms for a different one. This work aims to highlight that in
some cases, this common practice may lead to biased, overly-optimistic results.
We demonstrate this phenomenon for inverse problem solvers and show how their
biased performance stems from hidden data preprocessing pipelines. We describe
two preprocessing pipelines typical of open-access databases and study their
effects on three well-established algorithms developed for Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) reconstruction: Compressed Sensing (CS), Dictionary Learning
(DictL), and DL. In this large-scale study we performed extensive computations.
Our results demonstrate that the CS, DictL and DL algorithms yield
systematically biased results when naively trained on seemingly-appropriate
data: the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) improves consistently with
the preprocessing extent, showing an artificial increase of 25%-48% in some
cases. Since this phenomenon is generally unknown, biased results are sometimes
published as state-of-the-art; we refer to that as subtle data crimes. This
work hence raises a red flag regarding naive off-label usage of Big Data and
reveals the vulnerability of modern inverse problem solvers to the resulting
bias.

extracted from the 3d domain. The machine learning approach consists of a Deep
Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) of the same kind developed in computer

from two different points of view. From the machine learning point of view it
shows the potential of DCNN, reaching good results on such a particularly
complex problem that goes well outside the limits of human vision. Second, from
the physics point of view, it provides an example on how machine learning can
be exploited in data analysis to infer information that would be inaccessible
otherwise. Indeed, by comparing DCNN with the other possible Bayesian
approaches, we find that DCNN yields to a much higher inference accuracy in all
the examined cases.

Unfortunately, SVMs have a serious drawback. They are sensitive to imbalanced
datasets, outliers and high multicollinearity among training samples, which
could be a cause of preferencing one group over another. Thus, an additional
calibration could be required for balancing a predictive relevance of models.
As a technique for this balancing, we propose the Platt's scaling. The achieved
results were demonstrated on single-target models trained on datasets exported
from the ExCAPE database. Unlike traditional used machine techniques, we focus

communication with a wide array of applications in disciplines including the
Life Sciences, Computer Science, and the Social Sciences. Languages like RDF,
OWL, and other formalisms based on formal logic are applied to make scientific
knowledge accessible not only to human readers but also to automated systems.
These approaches have mostly focused on the structure of scientific
publications themselves, on the used scientific methods and equipment, or on
the structure of the used datasets. The core claims or hypotheses of scientific
work have only been covered in a shallow manner, such as by linking mentioned
entities to established identifiers. In this research, we therefore want to
find out whether we can use existing semantic formalisms to fully express the
content of high-level scientific claims using formal semantics in a systematic
way. Analyzing the main claims from a sample of scientific articles from all
disciplines, we find that their semantics are more complex than what a
straight-forward application of formalisms like RDF or OWL account for, but we
managed to elicit a clear semantic pattern which we call the 'super-pattern'.
We show here how the instantiation of the five slots of this super-pattern
leads to a strictly defined statement in higher-order logic. We successfully
applied this super-pattern to an enlarged sample of scientific claims. We show
that knowledge representation experts, when instructed to independently
instantiate the super-pattern with given scientific claims, show a high degree
of consistency and convergence given the complexity of the task and the
subject. These results therefore open the door for expressing high-level
scientific findings in a manner they can be automatically interpreted, which on
the longer run can allow us to do automated consistency checking, and much
more.

associations between two sets of variables. The canonically correlated
representations, termed \textit{canonical variates} are widely used in
unsupervised learning to analyze unlabeled multi-modal registered datasets.
Despite their success, CCA models may break (or overfit) if the number of
variables in either of the modalities exceeds the number of samples. Moreover,
often a significant fraction of the variables measures modality-specific
information, and thus removing them is beneficial for identifying the
\textit{canonically correlated variates}. Here, we propose $\ell_0$-CCA, a
method for learning correlated representations based on sparse subsets of
variables from two observed modalities. Sparsity is obtained by multiplying the
input variables by stochastic gates, whose parameters are learned together with
the CCA weights via an $\ell_0$-regularized correlation loss. We further
propose $\ell_0$-Deep CCA for solving the problem of non-linear sparse CCA by
modeling the correlated representations using deep nets. We demonstrate the
efficacy of the method using several synthetic and real examples. Most notably,

Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) by enforcing our conditions through proper
constraints in causal process prior. Experimental results on various datasets
demonstrate that temporally causal latent processes are reliably identified
from observed variables under different dependency structures and that our
approach considerably outperforms baselines that do not properly leverage

in an unsupervised manner, for which we believe our work is one of the first,

first need to understand the current state of the practice. Therefore, we have
developed a methodology for assessing the state of the software development
practices for a given research software domain. For each domain we wish to
answer questions such as: i) What artifacts (documents, code, test cases, etc.)
are present? ii) What tools are used? iii) What principles, process and
methodologies are used? iv) What are the pain points for developers? v) What
actions are used to improve qualities like maintainability and reproducibility?
To answer these questions, our methodology prescribes the following steps: i)
Identify the domain; ii) Identify a list of candidate software packages; iii)
Filter the list to a length of about 30 packages; iv) Gather source code and
documentation for each package; v) Collect repository related data on each
software package, like number of stars, number of open issues, number of lines
of code; vi) Fill in the measurement template (the template consists of 108
questions to assess 9 qualities (including the qualities of installability,
usability and visibility)); vii) Interview developers (the interview consists
of 20 questions and takes about an hour); viii) Rank the software using the
Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP); and, ix) Analyze the data to answer the
questions posed above. A domain expert should be engaged throughout the
process, to ensure that implicit information about the domain is properly
represented and to assist with conducting an analysis of the commonalities and
variabilities between the 30 selected packages. Using our methodology,
spreadsheet templates and AHP tool, we estimate (based on our experience with
using the process) the time to complete an assessment for a given domain at 173
person hours.

the state-action value (Q-function) by minimizing the mean squared Bellman
error leads to a regression problem with confounding, the inputs and output
noise being correlated. Hence, direct minimization of the Bellman error can
result in significantly biased Q-function estimates. We explain why fixing the
target Q-network in Deep Q-Networks and Fitted Q Evaluation provides a way of
overcoming this confounding, thus shedding new light on this popular but not
well understood trick in the deep RL literature. An alternative approach to
address confounding is to leverage techniques developed in the causality
literature, notably instrumental variables (IV). We bring together here the
literature on IV and RL by investigating whether IV approaches can lead to
improved Q-function estimates. This paper analyzes and compares a wide range of
recent IV methods in the context of offline policy evaluation (OPE), where the
goal is to estimate the value of a policy using logged data only. By applying
different IV techniques to OPE, we are not only able to recover previously
proposed OPE methods such as model-based techniques but also to obtain
competitive new techniques. We find empirically that state-of-the-art OPE
methods are closely matched in performance by some IV methods such as AGMM,
which were not developed for OPE. We open-source all our code and datasets at

  Acceleration","Accepted by the HPCA 20222, the 28th IEEE International Symposium on
  High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA-28)",,,,cs.AR cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Exploiting sparsity is a key technique in accelerating quantized
convolutional neural network (CNN) inference on mobile devices. Prior sparse
CNN accelerators largely exploit un-structured sparsity and achieve significant
speedups. Due to the unbounded, largely unpredictable sparsity patterns,
however, exploiting unstructured sparsity requires complicated hardware design
with significant energy and area overhead, which is particularly detrimental to
mobile/IoT inference scenarios where energy and area efficiency are crucial. We
propose to exploit structured sparsity, more specifically, Density Bound Block
(DBB) sparsity for both weights and activations. DBB block tensors bound the
maximum number of non-zeros per block. DBB thus exposes statically predictable
sparsity patterns that enable lean sparsity-exploiting hardware. We propose new
hardware primitives to implement DBB sparsity for (static) weights and
(dynamic) activations, respectively, with very low overheads. Building on top
of the primitives, we describe S2TA, a systolic array-based CNN accelerator
that exploits joint weight and activation DBB sparsity and new dimensions of
data reuse unavailable on the traditional systolic array. S2TA in 16nm achieves
more than 2x speedup and energy reduction compared to a strong baseline of a
systolic array with zero-value clock gating, over five popular CNN benchmarks.
Compared to two recent non-systolic sparse accelerators, Eyeriss v2 (65nm) and
SparTen (45nm), S2TA in 65nm uses about 2.2x and 3.1x less energy per
inference, respectively.

high-level planner approximates the race as a discrete game with simplified
dynamics that encodes the complex safety and fairness rules seen in real-life
racing and calculates a series of target waypoints. The low-level controller
takes the resulting waypoints as a reference trajectory and computes
high-resolution control inputs by solving a simplified formulation of a
multi-agent racing game. We consider two approaches for the low-level planner
to construct two hierarchical controllers. One approach uses multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL), and the other solves a linear-quadratic Nash
game (LQNG) to produce control inputs. We test the controllers against three
baselines: an end-to-end MARL controller, a MARL controller tracking a fixed
racing line, and an LQNG controller tracking a fixed racing line. Quantitative
results show that the proposed hierarchical methods outperform their respective
baseline methods in terms of head-to-head race wins and abiding by the rules.
The hierarchical controller using MARL for low-level control consistently
outperformed all other methods by winning over 88% of head-to-head races and
more consistently adhered to the complex racing rules. Qualitatively, we
observe the proposed controllers mimicking actions performed by expert human
drivers such as shielding/blocking, overtaking, and long-term planning for
delayed advantages. We show that hierarchical planning for game-theoretic
reasoning produces competitive behavior even when challenged with complex rules
and constraints.

causes many issues to traditional approaches. Two languages written in two
different orthographies are not easily comparable, but orthographic information

data sets. Therefore, they have to scale well on any modern system and be able
to exploit the computing power of accelerators independent of their vendor. In
the field of supervised learning, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are widely
used. However, even modern and optimized implementations such as LIBSVM or
ThunderSVM do not scale well for large non-trivial dense data sets on
cutting-edge hardware: Most SVM implementations are based on Sequential Minimal
Optimization, an optimized though inherent sequential algorithm. Hence, they
are not well-suited for highly parallel GPUs. Furthermore, we are not aware of
a performance portable implementation that supports CPUs and GPUs from
different vendors.
  We have developed the PLSSVM library to solve both issues. First, we resort
to the formulation of the SVM as a least squares problem. Training an SVM then
boils down to solving a system of linear equations for which highly parallel
algorithms are known. Second, we provide a hardware independent yet efficient
implementation: PLSSVM uses different interchangeable backends--OpenMP, CUDA,
OpenCL, SYCL--supporting modern hardware from various vendors like NVIDIA, AMD,
or Intel on multiple GPUs. PLSSVM can be used as a drop-in replacement for
LIBSVM. We observe a speedup on CPUs of up to 10 compared to LIBSVM and on GPUs
of up to 14 compared to ThunderSVM. Our implementation scales on many-core CPUs
with a parallel speedup of 74.7 on up to 256 CPU threads and on multiple GPUs
with a parallel speedup of 3.71 on four GPUs.

classifiers to maximize their misclassification rates is a central focus of
adversarial machine learning. An alternative approach is to synthesize

use of large amounts of training data. By contrast, this paper considers
one-shot synthesis of adversarial examples; the inputs are synthesized from

models, while simultaneously maintaining high similarity to specified inputs.
To this end, we present a problem that encodes objectives on the distance
between the desired and output distributions of the trained model and the

surrogate loss functions for the dual-objective. We demonstrate the generality

self-supervised representation learning. For domain adaptation, however, FCL

propose a novel probability contrastive learning (PCL) in this paper, which not
only produces compact features but also enforces them to be distributed around
the class weights. Specifically, we propose to use the output probabilities
after softmax to perform contrastive learning instead of the extracted features

the probability will approximate the one-hot form, thereby narrowing the

superior, performance over distributed algorithms with a central node.
Recently, developing decentralized algorithms for deep learning has attracted
great attention. They are considered as low-communication-overhead alternatives
to those using a parameter server or the Ring-Allreduce protocol. However, the
lack of an easy-to-use and efficient software package has kept most
decentralized algorithms merely on paper. To fill the gap, we introduce
BlueFog, a python library for straightforward, high-performance implementations
of diverse decentralized algorithms. Based on a unified abstraction of various
communication operations, BlueFog offers intuitive interfaces to implement a
spectrum of decentralized algorithms, from those using a static, undirected
graph for synchronous operations to those using dynamic and directed graphs for
asynchronous operations. BlueFog also adopts several system-level acceleration
techniques to further optimize the performance on the deep learning tasks. On
mainstream DNN training tasks, BlueFog reaches a much higher throughput and
achieves an overall $1.2\times \sim 1.8\times$ speedup over Horovod, a

in understanding and shaping the interaction mechanisms between humans and
robots. The interaction implies communication between two dyadic agents and, if
the type of interaction is physical, the communication is represented by the
set of forces exchanged during the interaction. Within this context, the role
of quantifying these forces becomes of pivotal importance for understanding the
interaction mechanisms. At the current scientific stage, classical robots are
built to act for humans, but the scientific demand is going towards the
direction of robots that will have to collaborate with humans. This will be
possible by providing the robots with sufficient pieces of information of the
agent they are interacting with (i.e., kinematic and dynamic model of the
human). In a modern age where humans need the help of robots, apparently in an
opposite trend, this thesis attempts to answer the following questions: Do
robots need humans? Should robots know their human partners? A tentative answer
is provided here in the form of a novel framework for the simultaneous human
whole-body motion tracking and dynamics estimation, in a real-time scenario.
The framework encompasses a set of body-mounted sensors and a probabilistic
algorithm able of estimating physical quantities that in humans are not
directly measurable (i.e., torques and internal forces). This thesis is mainly
focussed on the paramount role in retrieving the human dynamics estimation but
straightforwardly it leaves the door open to the next development step: passing
the human dynamics feedback to the robot controllers. This step will enable the
robot with the capability to observe and understand the human partner by

of transverse translational ptychography and defocus multi-height phase
retrieval. In this approach, we place a tilted image sensor under the specimen
for linearly-increasing phase modulation along one lateral direction. Similar
to the operation of ptychography, we laterally translate the specimen and
acquire the diffraction images for reconstruction. Since the axial distance
between the specimen and the sensor varies at different lateral positions,
laterally translating the specimen effectively introduces defocus multi-height
measurements while eliminating axial scanning. Lateral translation further
introduces sub-pixel shift for pixel super-resolution imaging and naturally
expands the field of view for rapid whole slide imaging. We show that the
equivalent height variation can be precisely estimated from the lateral shift
of the specimen, thereby addressing the challenge of precise axial positioning
in conventional multi-height phase retrieval. Using a sensor with a 1.67-micron
pixel size, our low-cost and field-portable prototype can resolve 690-nm
linewidth on the resolution target. We show that a whole slide image of a blood
smear with a 120-mm^2 field of view can be acquired in 18 seconds. We also
demonstrate accurate automatic white blood cell counting from the recovered
image. The reported approach may provide a turnkey solution for addressing

the design of probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS), which is a popular scheme
that relies on an amplitude shaper for increasing spectral efficiencies of
fiber-optic systems. One property of certain shapers used in PAS -- including
constant-composition distribution matchers -- that is often overlooked is that
a time-dependency between amplitudes is introduced. This dependency results in
symbols that are non-i.i.d., which have time-varying statistical properties.
Somewhat surprisingly, the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in PAS has
been shown to increase when the shaping blocklength decreases. This blocklength
dependency of SNR has been attributed to time-varying statistical properties of
the symbol sequences, in particular, to variation of the symbol energies. In
this paper, we investigate the temporal energy behavior of symbol sequences,
and introduce a new metric called energy dispersion index (EDI). EDI captures
the time-varying statistical properties of symbol energies. Numerical results
show strong correlations between EDI and effective SNR, with absolute
correlation coefficients above 99% for different transmission distances.

tasks involving semantic segmentation of images. CNNs are vulnerable in the
area of biomedical image segmentation because of distributional gap between two
source and target domains with different data modalities which leads to domain
shift. Domain shift makes data annotations in new modalities necessary because
models must be retrained from scratch. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is
proposed to adapt a model to new modalities using solely unlabeled target
domain data. Common UDA algorithms require access to data points in the source
domain which may not be feasible in medical imaging due to privacy concerns. In
this work, we develop an algorithm for UDA in a privacy-constrained setting,
where the source domain data is inaccessible. Our idea is based on encoding the
information from the source samples into a prototypical distribution that is
used as an intermediate distribution for aligning the target domain
distribution with the source domain distribution. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing it to state-of-the-art medical
image semantic segmentation approaches on two medical image semantic
segmentation datasets.

This paper proposes a general machine learning framework called Neural
Information Squeezer to automatically extract the effective coarse-graining

directly from the time series data. By decomposing a coarse-graining operation
into two processes: information conversion and information dropping out, we can
not only exactly control the width of the information channel, but also can
derive some important properties analytically including the exact expression of

  Traffic Assignment",,,,,eess.SY cs.CY cs.SY,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  System optimum (SO) routing, wherein the total travel time of all users is
minimized, is a holy grail for transportation authorities. However, SO routing
may discriminate against users who incur much larger travel times than others
to achieve high system efficiency, i.e., low total travel times. To address the
inherent unfairness of SO routing, we study the ${\beta}$-fair SO problem whose
goal is to minimize the total travel time while guaranteeing a ${\beta\geq 1}$
level of unfairness, which specifies the maximum possible ratio between the
travel times of different users with shared origins and destinations.
  To obtain feasible solutions to the ${\beta}$-fair SO problem while achieving
high system efficiency, we develop a new convex program, the Interpolated
Traffic Assignment Problem (I-TAP), which interpolates between a
fairness-promoting and an efficiency-promoting traffic-assignment objective. We
evaluate the efficacy of I-TAP through theoretical bounds on the total system
travel time and level of unfairness in terms of its interpolation parameter, as
well as present a numerical comparison between I-TAP and a state-of-the-art
algorithm on a range of transportation networks. The numerical results indicate
that our approach is faster by several orders of magnitude as compared to the
benchmark algorithm, while achieving higher system efficiency for all desirable
levels of unfairness. We further leverage the structure of I-TAP to develop two
pricing mechanisms to collectively enforce the I-TAP solution in the presence
of selfish homogeneous and heterogeneous users, respectively, that
independently choose routes to minimize their own travel costs. We mention that
this is the first study of pricing in the context of fair routing for general
road networks (as opposed to, e.g., parallel road networks).

efficient and accurate with more practical and advanced datasets. Previous PPML
schemes replace non-arithmetic activation functions with simple arithmetic
functions instead of adopting approximation methods and do not use
bootstrapping, which enables continuous homomorphic evaluations. Thus, they
could not use standard activation functions and could not employ a large number
of layers. The maximum classification accuracy of the existing PPML model with
the FHE for the CIFAR-10 dataset was only 77% until now. In this work, we
firstly implement the standard ResNet-20 model with the RNS-CKKS FHE with
bootstrapping and verify the implemented model with the CIFAR-10 dataset and

learn useful representations from unlabeled sensor inputs, such as

varied and complex to be captured by known downsampling kernels and
signal-independent noises. So, in order to successfully super-resolve real
faces, a method needs to be robust to a wide range of noise, blur, compression
artifacts etc. Some of the recent works attempt to model these degradations
from a dataset of real images using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).
They generate synthetically degraded LR images and use them with corresponding
real high-resolution(HR) image to train a super-resolution (SR) network using a
combination of a pixel-wise loss and an adversarial loss. In this paper, we
propose a two module super-resolution network where the feature extractor
module extracts robust features from the LR image, and the SR module generates
an HR estimate using only these robust features. We train a degradation GAN to
convert bicubically downsampled clean images to real degraded images, and
interpolate between the obtained degraded LR image and its clean LR
counterpart. This interpolated LR image is then used along with it's
corresponding HR counterpart to train the super-resolution network from end to
end. Entropy Regularized Wasserstein Divergence is used to force the encoded
features learnt from the clean and degraded images to closely resemble those
extracted from the interpolated image to ensure robustness.

modalities as it offers excellent spatial resolution and soft-tissue contrast.
But, the usage of MRI is limited by its slow acquisition time, which makes it
expensive and causes patient discomfort. In order to accelerate the
acquisition, multiple deep learning networks have been proposed. Recently,
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown promising results in MRI
reconstruction. The drawback with the proposed GAN based methods is it does not
incorporate the prior information about the end goal which could help in better
reconstruction. For instance, in the case of cardiac MRI, the physician would
be interested in the heart region which is of diagnostic relevance while
excluding the peripheral regions. In this work, we show that incorporating
prior information about a region of interest in the model would offer better
performance. Thereby, we propose a novel GAN based architecture, Reconstruction
Global-Local GAN (Recon-GLGAN) for MRI reconstruction. The proposed model
contains a generator and a context discriminator which incorporates global and
local contextual information from images. Our model offers significant
performance improvement over the baseline models. Our experiments show that the

reconstruction models to offer better performance. We also demonstrate that the

redundant execution is not always feasible due to resource constraints. In this

perception system while keeping the additional compute overhead minimal. In
contrast to existing solutions, the monitor is realized by a well-balanced
combination of sensor checks -- here using LiDAR information -- and
plausibility checks on the object motion history. It is designed to detect

learning algorithms. Many real-world domains are, by definition, class
imbalanced by virtue of having a majority class that naturally has many more
instances than its minority class (e.g. genuine bank transactions occur much
more often than fraudulent ones). Many methods have been proposed to solve the
class imbalance problem, among the most popular being oversampling techniques
(such as SMOTE). These methods generate synthetic instances in the minority
class, to balance the dataset, performing data augmentations that improve the
performance of predictive machine learning (ML) models. In this paper we
advance a novel data augmentation method (adapted from eXplainable AI), that
generates synthetic, counterfactual instances in the minority class. Unlike
other oversampling techniques, this method adaptively combines exist-ing
instances from the dataset, using actual feature-values rather than
interpolating values between instances. Several experiments using four
different classifiers and 25 datasets are reported, which show that this
Counterfactual Augmentation method (CFA) generates useful synthetic data points

Can we teach them instead to identify paraphrases in a way that draws on the

participants to generate semantically equivalent (in the sense of mutually

sentence pairs can then be used both to test paraphrase identification models
(which get barely random accuracy) and then improve their performance. To
accelerate dataset generation, we explore automation of APT using T5, and show

varies not only between problems, but also between instances of the same

effectively evaluate a new solving method. Current methods for automatic
generation of instances for Constraint Programming problems start with a
declarative model and search for instances with some desired attributes, such
as hardness or size. We first explore the difficulties of adapting this
approach to generate instances starting from problem specifications written in
PDDL, the de-facto standard language of the automated planning community. We

we propose two computationally efficient multimodal fusion frameworks for ECG
heart beat classification called Multimodal Image Fusion (MIF) and Multimodal
Feature Fusion (MFF). At the input of these frameworks, we convert the raw ECG
data into three different images using Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Recurrence
Plot (RP) and Markov Transition Field (MTF). In MIF, we first perform image
fusion by combining three imaging modalities to create a single image modality
which serves as input to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In MFF, we
extracted features from penultimate layer of CNNs and fused them to get unique
and interdependent information necessary for better performance of classifier.
These informational features are finally used to train a Support Vector Machine

scientists in finding meaningful dependence among features, which can engender
further analysis for feature selection, feature extraction, projection,
identification of proxy variables, or insight into temporal variation at the
macro scale. Graph mining approaches for feature analysis exist, such as
association networks of binary features, or correlation networks of
quantitative features, but mixed data types present a unique challenge for
developing comprehensive feature networks for exploratory analysis. Using an
information theoretic approach, Sirius supports heterogeneous data sets
consisting of binary, continuous quantitative, and discrete categorical data
types, and provides a user interface exploring feature pairs with high mutual
information scores. We leverage a backbone sparsification approach from network
theory as a dimensionality reduction technique, which probabilistically trims
edges according to the local network context. Sirius is an open source Python
package and Django web application for exploratory visualization, which can be
deployed in data analysis pipelines. The Sirius codebase and exemplary data

reconstruction has achieved significant progress recently. However, previous
methods are built upon intuitions, lacking comprehensive explanations about the
effectiveness of the pretext task in self-supervised MVS. To this end, we
propose to estimate epistemic uncertainty in self-supervised MVS, accounting
for what the model ignores. Specially, the limitations can be categorized into
two types: ambiguious supervision in foreground and invalid supervision in
background. To address these issues, we propose a novel Uncertainty reduction
Multi-view Stereo (UMVS) framework for self-supervised learning. To alleviate
ambiguous supervision in foreground, we involve extra correspondence prior with
a flow-depth consistency loss. The dense 2D correspondence of optical flows is
used to regularize the 3D stereo correspondence in MVS. To handle the invalid
supervision in background, we use Monte-Carlo Dropout to acquire the
uncertainty map and further filter the unreliable supervision signals on
invalid regions. Extensive experiments on DTU and Tank&Temples benchmark show
that our U-MVS framework achieves the best performance among unsupervised MVS
methods, with competitive performance with its supervised opponents.

occlusion in crowded scenes, where the state-of-the-art approaches adopt
homography transformations to project multi-view features to the ground plane.
However, we find that these 2D transformations do not take into account the
object's height, and with this neglection features along the vertical direction
of same object are likely not projected onto the same ground plane point,
leading to impure ground-plane features. To solve this problem, we propose VFA,
voxelized 3D feature aggregation, for feature transformation and aggregation in
multi-view detection. Specifically, we voxelize the 3D space, project the
voxels onto each camera view, and associate 2D features with these projected
voxels. This allows us to identify and then aggregate 2D features along the
same vertical line, alleviating projection distortions to a large extent.
Additionally, because different kinds of objects (human vs. cattle) have
different shapes on the ground plane, we introduce the oriented Gaussian
encoding to match such shapes, leading to increased accuracy and efficiency. We
perform experiments on multiview 2D detection and multiview 3D detection
problems. Results on four datasets (including a newly introduced MultiviewC
dataset) show that our system is very competitive compared with the

and the purpose of routing is to identify part-whole relationships between
capsules. That is, a capsule in one layer is assumed to belong to a capsule in
the layer above in terms of the entity being represented. Using capsule
routing, we wish to train a network that can learn global coherence implicitly,
thereby improving generalization performance. Our proposed method is evaluated

gradients of all $m$ objective functions per iteration, produce after $k$
iterations a measure of proximity to critical conditions that is upper-bounded
by $O(1/\sqrt{k})$ when the objective functions are assumed to have
$L-$Lipschitz continuous gradients; i.e. they require $O(m/\epsilon^2)$
gradient and function computations to produce a measure of proximity to
critical conditions bellow some target $\epsilon$. We reduce this to
$O(1/\epsilon^2)$ with a method that requires only a constant number of
gradient and function computations per iteration; and thus, we obtain for the
first time a multi-objective descent-type method with a query complexity cost
that is unaffected by increasing values of $m$. For this, a brand new
multi-objective descent direction is identified, which we name the
\emph{central descent direction}, and, an incremental approach is proposed.
Robustness properties of the central descent direction are established,
measures of proximity to critical conditions are derived, and, the incremental
strategy for finding solutions to the multi-objective problem is shown to
attain convergence properties unattained by previous methods. To the best of

scalarizing techniques, and, with no pre-known information on the regularity of

  Cardiac Segmentation",accepted by IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,,,,eess.IV cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Unsupervised domain adaptation is useful in medical image segmentation.
Particularly, when ground truths of the target images are not available, domain
adaptation can train a target-specific model by utilizing the existing labeled
images from other modalities. Most of the reported works mapped images of both
the source and target domains into a common latent feature space, and then
reduced their discrepancy either implicitly with adversarial training or
explicitly by directly minimizing a discrepancy metric. In this work, we
propose a new framework, where the latent features of both domains are driven
towards a common and parameterized variational form, whose conditional
distribution given the image is Gaussian. This is achieved by two networks
based on variational auto-encoders (VAEs) and a regularization for this
variational approximation. Both of the VAEs, each for one domain, contain a
segmentation module, where the source segmentation is trained in a supervised
manner, while the target one is trained unsupervisedly. We validated the
proposed domain adaptation method using two cardiac segmentation tasks, i.e.,
the cross-modality (CT and MR) whole heart segmentation and the cross-sequence
cardiac MR segmentation. Results show that the proposed method achieved better
accuracies compared to two state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrated good
potential for cardiac segmentation. Furthermore, the proposed explicit
regularization was shown to be effective and efficient in narrowing down the
distribution gap between domains, which is useful for unsupervised domain
adaptation. Our code and data has been released via

the master's thesis is the last, but also most applied form of this education
in their studies.
  Problem: Especially thesis work in collaboration with industry requires that
concerns of stakeholders from academia and practice are carefully balanced. It
is possible, yet difficult to do high-impact empirical work within the
timeframe of a typical thesis. In particular, if this research aims to provide
practical value to industry, academic quality can suffer. Even though
constructive research methods such as Design Science Research (DSR) exist,
thesis projects repeatably struggle to apply them.
  Principle solution idea: DSR enables balancing such concerns by providing
room both for knowledge questions and design work. Yet, only limited experience
exists in our field on how to make this research method work within the context
of a master's thesis. To enable running design science master's theses in
collaboration with industry, we complement existing method descriptions and
guidelines with our own experience and pragmatic advice to students, examiners,
and supervisors in academia and industry.
  Method: This paper itself is based on DSR. Based on 12 design science theses
over the last seven years, we collect common pitfalls and good practice from
analysing the theses, the student-supervisor interaction, the
supervisor-industry interaction, the examiner feedback, and, where available,
reviewer comments on publications that are based on such theses.
  Results: We provide concrete advise for framing research questions,
structuring a report, as well as for planning and conducting empirical work
with practitioners.

Segmentation (SS): 1) missing small objects or minor object parts, and 2)
mislabeling minor parts of large objects as wrong classes. We have an
interesting finding that Failure-1 is due to the underuse of detailed features
and Failure-2 is due to the underuse of visual contexts. To help the model
learn a better trade-off, we introduce several Self-Regulation (SR) losses for
training SS neural networks. By ""self"", we mean that the losses are from the
model per se without using any additional data or supervision. By applying the
SR losses, the deep layer features are regulated by the shallow ones to
preserve more details; meanwhile, shallow layer classification logits are
regulated by the deep ones to capture more semantics. We conduct extensive
experiments on both weakly and fully supervised SS tasks, and the results show
that our approach consistently surpasses the baselines. We also validate that
SR losses are easy to implement in various state-of-the-art SS models, e.g.,
SPGNet and OCRNet, incurring little computational overhead during training and
none for testing.

  https://github.com/RationalityEnhancement/InterpretableStrategyDiscovery",,,,cs.AI cs.CY cs.HC,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Human decision-making is plagued by many systematic errors. Many of these
errors can be avoided by providing decision aids that guide decision-makers to
attend to the important information and integrate it according to a rational
decision strategy. Designing such decision aids is a tedious manual process.
Advances in cognitive science might make it possible to automate this process
in the future. We recently introduced machine learning methods for discovering
optimal strategies for human decision-making automatically and an automatic
method for explaining those strategies to people. Decision aids constructed by
this method were able to improve human decision-making. However, following the
descriptions generated by this method is very tedious. We hypothesized that
this problem can be overcome by conveying the automatically discovered decision
strategy as a series of natural language instructions for how to reach a
decision. Experiment 1 showed that people do indeed understand such procedural
instructions more easily than the decision aids generated by our previous
method. Encouraged by this finding, we developed an algorithm for translating
the output of our previous method into procedural instructions. We applied the
improved method to automatically generate decision aids for a naturalistic
planning task (i.e., planning a road trip) and a naturalistic decision task
(i.e., choosing a mortgage). Experiment 2 showed that these automatically
generated decision-aids significantly improved people's performance in planning
a road trip and choosing a mortgage. These findings suggest that AI-powered
boosting has potential for improving human decision-making in the real world.

  symposium had to be cancelled",,,,cs.CY,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  In health psychology, Behaviour Change Theories(BCTs) play an important role
in modelling human goal achievement in adverse environments. Some of these
theories use concepts that are also used in computational modelling of
cognition and affect in AI. Examples include dual-process architecture and
models of motivation. It is therefore important to ask whether some BCTs can be
computationally implemented as cognitive agents in a way that builds on
existing AI research in cognitive architecture. This paper presents
work-in-progress research to apply selected behaviour change theories to
simulated agents, so that an agent is acting according to the theory while
attempting to complete a task in a challenging scenario. Two behaviour change
theories are selected as examples (CEOS and PRIME). The research is focusing on
complex agent architectures required for self-determined goal achievement in
adverse circumstances where the action is difficult to maintain (e.g. healthy
eating at office parties). Such simulations are useful because they can provide
new insights into human behaviour change and improve conceptual precision. In
addition, they can act as a rapid-prototyping environment for technology
development. High-level descriptive simulations also provide an opportunity for
transparency and participatory design, which is important for user ownership of
the behaviour change process.

that continue to impact every aspect of today's society. With the development
of high performance GPUs and the availability of vast amounts of data, learning
capabilities of ML systems have skyrocketed, going from classifying digits in a
picture to beating world-champions in games with super-human performance.
However, even as ML models continue to achieve new frontiers, their practical
success has been hindered by the lack of a deep theoretical understanding of
their inner workings. Fortunately, a known information-theoretic method called
the information bottleneck theory has emerged as a promising approach to better
understand the learning dynamics of neural networks. In principle, IB theory
models learning as a trade-off between the compression of the data and the
retainment of information. The goal of this survey is to provide a
comprehensive review of IB theory covering it's information theoretic roots and
the recently proposed applications to understand deep learning models.

concerning IoT malware detection and studies security issues inherent to this
new learning paradigm. In this context, a framework that uses federated
learning to detect malware affecting IoT devices is presented. N-BaIoT, a
dataset modeling network traffic of several real IoT devices while affected by
malware, has been used to evaluate the proposed framework. Both supervised and
unsupervised federated models (multi-layer perceptron and autoencoder) able to
detect malware affecting seen and unseen IoT devices of N-BaIoT have been
trained and evaluated. Furthermore, their performance has been compared to two
traditional approaches. The first one lets each participant locally train a
model using only its own data, while the second consists of making the
participants share their data with a central entity in charge of training a
global model. This comparison has shown that the use of more diverse and large
data, as done in the federated and centralized methods, has a considerable
positive impact on the model performance. Besides, the federated models, while
preserving the participant's privacy, show similar results as the centralized
ones. As an additional contribution and to measure the robustness of the
federated approach, an adversarial setup with several malicious participants
poisoning the federated model has been considered. The baseline model
aggregation averaging step used in most federated learning algorithms appears
highly vulnerable to different attacks, even with a single adversary. The
performance of other model aggregation functions acting as countermeasures is
thus evaluated under the same attack scenarios. These functions provide a
significant improvement against malicious participants, but more efforts are
still needed to make federated approaches robust.

future 6G wireless systems. Different categories of use cases are considered,
from extreme capacity with peak data rates up to 1 Tbps, to raising the typical
data rates by orders-of-magnitude, to support broadband connectivity at railway
speeds up to 1000 km/h. To achieve these goals, not only the terrestrial
networks will be evolved but they will also be integrated with satellite
networks, all facilitating autonomous systems and various interconnected
structures. We believe that several categories of enablers at the
infrastructure, spectrum, and protocol/ algorithmic levels are required to
realize the intended broadband connectivity goals in 6G. At the infrastructure
level, we consider ultra-massive MIMO technology (possibly implemented using
holographic radio), intelligent reflecting surfaces, user-centric and scalable
cell-free networking, integrated access and backhaul, and integrated space and
terrestrial networks. At the spectrum level, the network must seamlessly
utilize sub-6 GHz bands for coverage and spatial multiplexing of many devices,
while higher bands will be used for pushing the peak rates of point-to-point
links. The latter path will lead to THz communications complemented by visible
light communications in specific scenarios. At the protocol/algorithmic level,
the enablers include improved coding, modulation, and waveforms to achieve
lower latencies, higher reliability, and reduced complexity. Different options
will be needed to optimally support different use cases. The resource
efficiency can be further improved by using various combinations of full-duplex
radios, interference management based on rate-splitting, machine-learning-based
optimization, coded caching, and broadcasting.

guarantee the stability in a power system hosting a very large share of

fulfilled by synchronous machines. However, with the appropriate control, it
can also be provided by voltage source converters (VSC). This work presents a
comparison between two technologies with grid-forming capability: the VSC with
a grid-forming control coupled with an adequate energy storage system, and the
synchronous condensers (SC). Both devices are compared regarding their inertial
response, as well as their contribution to the system strength and
short-circuit current for an equivalent capacity expressed in terms of apparent
power and inertial reserve. Their behaviour following grid disturbances is
assessed through time-domain simulations based on detailed electromagnetic
transient (EMT) models. The results show that both devices achieve similar
performance in the time-scale of seconds. For shorter time-windows, however,
they present a different behavior: the SC ensures a better stiffness in the
first tens of ms following the disturbance, while the VSC offers a faster
resynchronization.

recognition as well as robotic facial expression generation. In the case of
human facial expression recognition, both facial expression recognition on

expression generation, hand-coded and automated methods i.e., facial
expressions of a robot are generated by moving the features (eyes, mouth) of
the robot by hand-coding or automatically using machine learning techniques,

accuracy for emotion expression recognition on predefined datasets, but the
accuracy for facial expression recognition in real-time is comparatively lower.
In the case of expression generation in robots, while most of the robots are
capable of making basic facial expressions, there are not many studies that
enable robots to do so automatically. In this overview, state-of-the-art
research in facial emotion expressions during human-robot interaction has been
discussed leading to several possible directions for future research.
