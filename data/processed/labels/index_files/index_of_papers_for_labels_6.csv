applications in communications, laser frequency stabilization,
microwave-to-optical conversion and frequency comb generation. However, most
studies are restricted to the adiabatic regime, where either the maximum
excursion of the modulation or the modulation frequency itself is below the
linewidth of the cavity. Here, using a fiber ring resonator with an embedded
electro-optic phase modulator, we investigate the nonadiabatic regime. By
strongly driving the modulator at frequencies that are significantly smaller
than the free-spectral range of the ring resonator, but well beyond the
linewidth of the resonator, we experimentally observe counterintuitive behavior
predicted in a recent theoretical study by Minkov et al. [APL Photonics 2,
076101 (2017)], such as the complete suppression of drop-port transmission even
when the input laser wavelength is on resonance with the optical cavity. This
can be understood as dynamical isolation of the cavity from the input light. We
also show qualitative differences in the steady-state responses of the system
between the adiabatic and nonadiabatic limits. Our experiments probe a seldom
explored regime of operation that is promising for applications in integrated
photonic systems with current state-of-the-art technology.

these metadata describing document types are useful in a variety of scenarios
ranging from research analytics to improving search and recommender (SR)
systems, this problem has not yet been sufficiently addressed in the context of
the repositories infrastructure. We have developed a new approach for
classifying document types using supervised machine learning based exclusively
on text specific features. We achieve 0.96 F1-score using the random forest and
Adaboost classifiers, which are the best performing models on our data. By
analysing the SR system logs of the CORE [1] digital library aggregator, we
show that users are an order of magnitude more likely to click on research
papers and thesis than on slides. This suggests that using document types as a
feature for ranking/filtering SR results in digital libraries has the potential
to improve user experience.

  Systems: Sliding Mode Observer Approach",Published by IntechOpen,,10.5772/intechopen.88669,,eess.SY cs.SY,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  A cyber-physical system (CPS) is a tight coupling of computational resources,
network communication, and physical processes. They are composed of a set of
networked components, including sensors, actuators, control processing units,
and communication agents that instrument the physical world to make smarter.
However, cyber components are also the source of new, unprecedented
vulnerabilities to malicious attacks. In order to protect a CPS from attacks,
three security levels of protection, detection, and identification are
considered. In this chapter, we will discuss the identification level, i.e.,
secure state estimation and attack reconstruction of CPS with corrupted states
and measurements. Considering different attack plans that may assault the
states, sensors, or both of them, different online attack reconstruction
approaches are discussed. Fixed-gain and adaptive-gain finite-time convergent
observation algorithms, specifically sliding mode observers, are applied to the
online reconstruction of sensor and state attacks. Next, the corrupted
measurements and states are to be cleaned up online in order to stop the attack
propagation to the CPS via the control signal. The proposed methodologies are
applied to an electric power network, whose states and sensors are under
attack. Simulation results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed observers.

reinforcement learning task. Such a task formulation encompasses the notion of
a musical agent and an environment containing an instrument as well as the
sound source to be transcribed. Within this conceptual framework, the
transcription process can be described as the agent interacting with the
instrument in the environment, and obtaining reward by playing along with what
it hears. Choosing from a discrete set of actions - the notes to play on its
instrument - the amount of reward the agent experiences depends on which notes
it plays and when. This process resembles how a human musician might approach
the task of transcription, and the satisfaction she achieves by closely
mimicking the sound source to transcribe on her instrument. Following a
discussion of the theoretical framework and the benefits of modelling the
problem in this way, we focus our attention on several practical considerations
and address the difficulties in training an agent to acceptable performance on
a set of tasks with increasing difficulty. We demonstrate promising results in
partially constrained environments.

  Exclusive Economic Zone of Cuba","33 pages, 14 figures. Submitted to Remote Sensing of Environment",,,,physics.ao-ph,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  In this work, we analysed the satellite-based responses of sea surface
temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration in the waters of the
Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Cuba to hurricanes that crossed the EEZ
between 1998 and 2016. We considered two spatial scales to capture the
spatially heterogeneous nature of the effects of hurricanes. A first more
fine-grained one where we considered 120 km radius disks centered at every
consecutive hurricane position within the EEZ (scale 1) and a second more
coarse grained one enclosing the entire EEZ (scale 2). We conclude that the
hurricanes induced a weak cooling since 75 and 85% of the SST anomalies at
scale 1 and 2, respectively, were smaller than -1{\deg}C. The cooling was
mainly caused by the wind, inducing mixing and/or upwelling of subsurface cool
waters. The maximum chl-a responses were recorded in the first and second
post-storm weeks, with 60% ranging between -0.01 and 0.04 mg m$^{-3}$ at scale
1, and between -0.07 and 0.02 mg m$^{-3}$ at scale 2. During those post-storm
weeks SST and chl-a anomalies were 18 and 44% higher at scale 1 than at scale
2, respectively. We argue that the transport of chl-a from the deep chlorophyll
maximum and/or the rich coastal waters are the dominant mechanisms determining
the post-storm chl-a response in the EEZ. We also found that the magnitude of
the Island Mass Effect in the EEZ after the passage of the hurricanes was 89%
higher than before its passage.

anharmonicity of the ladder of dressed energy eigenstates. The recent
developments in color center photonics are leading toward experimental
demonstrations of multi-emitter-cavity solid-state systems with an expanded set
of energy levels compared to the traditionally studied single-emitter systems.
We focus on the case of N = 2 nonidentical quasi-atoms strongly coupled to a
nanocavity in the bad cavity regime (with parameters within reach of the color
center systems), and discover three PB mechanisms: polaritonic, subradiant and
unconventional. The polaritonic PB, which is the conventional mechanism studied
in single-emitter-cavity systems, also occurs at the polariton frequencies in
multi-emitter systems. The subradiant PB is a new interference effect owing to
the inhomogeneous broadening of the emitters which results in a purer and a
more robust single photon emission than the polaritonic PB. The unconventional
PB in the modeled system corresponds to the suppression of the single- and
two-photon correlation statistics and the enhancement of the three-photon
correlation statistic. Using the effective Hamiltonian approach, we unravel the
origin and the time-domain evolution of these phenomena.

  and solution algorithms",,,,,cs.DM,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  A rectangle blanket is a set of non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles, used
to approximately represent the two dimensional image of a shape approximately.
The use of a rectangle blanket is a widely considered strategy for speeding-up
the computations in many computer vision applications. Since neither the
rectangles nor the image have to be fully covered by the other, the blanket
becomes more precise as the non-overlapping area of the image and the blanket
decreases. In this work, we focus on the rectangle blanket problem, which
involves the determination of an optimum blanket minimizing the non-overlapping
area with a given image subject to an upper bound on the total number of
rectangles the blanket can include. This problem has similarities with
rectangle covering, rectangle partitioning and cutting / packing problems. The
image replaces an irregular master object by an approximating set of smaller
axis-aligned rectangles. The union of these rectangles, namely, the rectangle
blanket, is neither restricted to remain entirely within the master object, nor
required to cover the master object completely. We first develop a binary
integer linear programming formulation of the problem. Then, we introduce four
methods for its solution. The first one is a branch-and-price algorithm that
computes an exact optimal solution. The second one is a new constrained
simulated annealing heuristic. The last two are heuristics adopting ideas
available in the literature for other computer vision related problems.
Finally, we realize extensive computational tests and report results on the
performances of these algorithms.

noisy topological relations discovered by a robot exploring large-scale office
spaces. Through experiments, we show that GraphSPNs consistently outperform the
traditional approach based on undirected graphical models, successfully
disambiguating information in global semantic maps built from uncertain, noisy
local evidence. We further exploit the probabilistic nature of the model to
infer marginal distributions over semantic descriptions of as yet unexplored

relate to arguments, reasons and justifications, decision theory almost
entirely ignores the latter notions and rather focuses on preference and
belief. In this article, we argue that decision theory can largely benefit from
explicitly taking into account the stance that decision-makers take towards
arguments and counter-arguments. To that end, we elaborate a formal framework
aiming to integrate the role of arguments and argumentation in decision theory
and decision aid. We start from a decision situation, where an individual
requests decision support. In this context, we formally define, as a
commendable basis for decision-aid, this individual's deliberated judgment,
popularized by Rawls. We explain how models of deliberated judgment can be
validated empirically. We then identify conditions upon which the existence of
a valid model can be taken for granted, and analyze how these conditions can be
relaxed. We then explore the significance of our proposed framework for
decision aiding practice. We argue that our concept of deliberated judgment
owes its normative credentials both to its normative foundations (the idea of
rationality based on arguments) and to its reference to empirical reality (the
stance that real, empirical individuals hold towards arguments and
counter-arguments, on due reflection). We then highlight that our framework

nowadays in machine learning: The search of a relevance measure for the
features of a given domain. This relevance is primarily used for feature
selection as feature weighting can be seen as a generalization of it, but it is
also useful to better understand a problem's domain or to guide an inductor in
its learning process. Relief family of algorithms are proven to be very
effective in this task. Some other feature weighting methods are reviewed in
order to give some context and then the different existing extensions to the
original algorithm are explained.
  One of Relief's known issues is the performance degradation of its estimates
when redundant features are present. A novel theoretical definition of
redundancy level is given in order to guide the work towards an extension of
the algorithm that is more robust against redundancy. A new extension is
presented that aims for improving the algorithms performance. Some experiments
were driven to test this new extension against the existing ones with a set of
artificial and real datasets and denoted that in certain cases it improves the
weight's estimation accuracy.

fully resolved Navier-Stokes equations is limited by the immense computational
cost and is thus only feasible for relatively small domains. Model reduction
allows to decrease a model's complexity while maintaining an acceptable degree
of accuracy. Starting from a fully resolved three-dimensional numerical model,
which is compared to high-resolution micro-PIV experimental data obtained from
a previous study (Terzis et al.,2019), we perform a two-fold model reduction:
first, a quasi-3D model incorporating a wall friction term is successfully
compared to the fully resolved model. Second, we employ a pore-network model to
account for the porous part of the domain and couple it to the quasi-3D model
which still resolves the free-flow part of the domain (Weishaupt et al., 2019).
We have extended this coupling approach here to include slip velocities at the
pore throats intersecting with the free-flow domain. The proposed method is
simple, accurate and comes at no additional run-time penalty. The coupled model
deviates by less than 10 % from the other two model concepts. Several hours of
run-time was required for the three-dimensional model compared to eleven and
five minutes necessary for the quasi-3D and coupled model which highlights the
benefits of model reduction.

incompressible axisymmetric turbulent jet at a Reynolds number of 2400. The DNS
data enable accurate maps of the outer irrotational flow field, and also the
vorticity field in the turbulent core of the jet. It is found necessary to
define two separate boundaries of the jet. The first is an inner boundary
(turbulent/nonturbulent, T/NT), from where vorticity rises steeply towards to
the core. The second is an outer rotational/irrotational boundary, beyond which
the flow may be considered irrotational. The velocity field beyond the outer
boundary often has ordered, nearly irrotational circulatory motions. These can
be shown, in simpler cases, to be the velocity field induced by one or more
vorticity elements in a coherent structure in the turbulent core. A detailed
examination of axial and diametral sections indicates that there are periods
when there is a large inrush of ambient fluid into parts of the T/NT interface,
which gets distorted into a gulf or well that can be both twisted and deep.
Sections of these wells often appear as what may be called as lakes of
irrotational fluid in diametral sections of the jet flow. Part of the inrushing
fluid crosses the T/NT interface within the well and is entrained into the
turbulent core, by a process that can legitimately be called nibbling. The
duration of such an inrush process can be of the order up to 20 flow units and
suggests that entrainment can be an episodic process in which an inrush event
accelerates ambient fluid even as it is pushed into a narrowing gulf, where it
penetrates the T/NT interface of the gulf by nibbling. In the turbulent round
jet, the entrainment burstiness is found to be of order 0.75, comparable to the
momentum flux burstiness found in a turbulent boundary layer.

its stopping decision solely from the observed satellite data. We show results

network outfitted with this early classification mechanism was able to
distinguish the many of the crop types before the end of the vegetative period.
Further, we associated these stopping times with evaluated ground truth
information and saw that the times of classification were related to
characteristic events of the observed plants' phenology.

beam's space charge is typically suppressed by way of neutralization from
either electrons or ions, which originate from ionization of the background
gas. In cases where the beam is chopped, the neutralization pattern usually
changes throughout the beginning of the pulse, causing the Twiss parameters to
differ significantly from their steady state values, which, in turn, may result
in beam losses downstream. For a modest beam perveance, there is an alternative
solution, in which the beam is kept un-neutralized in the portion of the LEBT
that contains the chopper. The emittance can be nearly preserved if the
transition to the un-neutralized section occurs where the beam exhibits low
transverse tails. This report introduces the rationale for the proposed scheme
and formulates the physical arguments for it as well as its limitations. An

This paper reports theoretical and experimental studies on the beneficial use
of the Vernier effect together with the spectral selective filtering in a
double directional coupler add-drop optical fibre ring resonator to increase
the comb repetition rate and generate high power microwaves. The studies are
focused on two selective filtering aspects: the high rejection of undesirable
optical modes of the frequency comb and the transmission of the desirable modes
with the lowest possible loss. Moreover, the conservation of the frequency comb
stability and linewidth at the resonator output is particularly considered.
Accordingly, a fibre ring resonator is designed, fabricated, and characterized,

significant power gain is achieved for the photonically generated beat note at

way. Theoretically, we use the Clumpy models from Nenkova et al. together with
the mid-infrared to X-ray and the radio fundamental plane scaling relations. We
find that it is more likely to detect bigger and denser dusty tori at the
highest ALMA frequency (666 GHz/450 micron). We also find that with 1h at 353
GHz/850 micron and 10h at 666 GHz/450 micron we can detect, with a high
detection limit, a 1 mJy torus (characteristic of bright AGN). This means, an
object for which the unresolved SED at 12 micron has a flux ~1mJy.
Observationally, we use four prototypical AGN: NGC\,1052 (low-luminosity AGN),
NGC\,1068 (Type-2), NGC\,3516 (Type 1.5), and IZw1 (QSO), with radio,
sub-millimeter, and mid-IR data available. All the mid-infrared spectra are
best fit with the smooth model reported by Fritz et al. A power law and a
single, or a composition of, synchrotron component/s reproduce the cm radio
wavelengths. We combined and extrapolated both fits to compare the
extrapolation of both torus and jet contributors at sub-mm wavelengths with
data at these wavelengths. Our observational results are consistent with our
theoretical results. The most promising candidate to detect the torus is the
QSO IZw1 (therefore, highly accreting sources in general), although it cannot
be resolved due to the distance of this source. We suggest that to explore the
detection of a torus at sub-mm wavelengths, it is necessary to perform an SED
analysis including radio data, with particular attention to the angular
resolution.

that over all finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$, any homogeneous depth-$5$ circuit

Models of shear-thinning complex fluids, dating from the work of Bird, Carreau,

heamodynamics for several decades. In this manuscript we revisit these models,
first to highlight a degree of uncertainty in the naming conventions in the
literature, but more importantly to address the problem of inferring model
parameters by fitting rheology experiments. By refitting published data, and
also by simulation, we find large, flat regions in likelihood surfaces that
yield families of parameter sets which fit the data equally well. Despite
having almost indistinguishable fits to experimental data these varying
parameter sets can predict very different flow profiles, and as such these
parameters cannot be used to draw conclusions about physical properties of the
fluids, such as zero-shear viscosity or relaxation time of the fluid, or indeed
flow behaviours. We verify that these features are not a consequence of the
experimental data sets through simulations; by sampling points from the
rheological models and adding a small amount of noise we create a synthetic
data set which reveals that the problem of parameter identifiability is
intrinsic to these models.

determine which inputs lead to which outputs. For the task of transcribing

identified as a serious problem in recent research). This is an entirely new
approach to audio transcription, which first of all necessitates some
groundwork. In this paper, we begin by looking at the simplest possible

itself generalizes to the free semimodule monad. Other representations serve
varied uses and performance trade-offs, with implementations calculated from

  Of particular interest is Brzozowski's method for regular expression
matching. Uncovering the method's essence frees it from syntactic

multisets and probability distributions) and from sets to n-ary relations. The
classic trie data structure then provides an elegant and efficient alternative

Zeno stabilisation schemes and the exact energy expense for quantum error
correction. Our results constitute fundamental energetic limitations against
which to benchmark implementations of future quantum devices as they grow in

This overview of modeling can be a great replacement with complex numerical

In this study, we develop the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system
(ANFIS) method for mapping inputs and outputs together and understand the
behavior of the fluid flow from other output parameters of the bubble column
reactor. Neural cells can fully learn the process in their memory and after the
training stage, the fuzzy structure predicts the multiphase flow data. Four
inputs such as x coordinate, y coordinate, z coordinate, and air superficial
velocity and one output such as pressure gradient are considered in the
learning process of the ANFIS method. During the learning process, the
different number of the membership function, type of membership functions and
the number of inputs are examined to achieve the intelligent algorithm with
high accuracy. The results show that as the number of inputs increases the
accuracy of the ANFIS method rises up to R^2>0.99 almost for all cases, while
the increment in the number of rules has a effect on the intelligence of
artificial algorithm. This finding shows that the density of neural objects or
higher input parameters enables the moded for better understanding. We also
proposed a new evaluation of data in the bubble column reactor by mapping
inputs and outputs and shuffle all parameters together to understand the
behaviour of the multiphase flow as a function of either inputs or outputs.
This new process of mapping inputs and outputs data provides a framework to
fully understand the flow in the fluid domain in a short time of fuzzy

anatomically plausible 3D poses. Our model is compositional (produces a pose by
combining parts) and since it is restricted only by anatomical constraints it
can generalize to every plausible human 3D pose. Removing the model bias
intrinsically helps to generate more diverse 3D pose hypotheses. We argue that
generating multiple pose hypotheses is more reasonable than generating only a
single 3D pose based on the 2D joint detection given the depth ambiguity and
the uncertainty due to occlusion and imperfect 2D joint detection. We hope that
the idea of generating multiple consistent pose hypotheses can give rise to a
new line of future work that has not received much attention in the literature.

filtering, we need to design non-uniform filter banks (NUFB), which may lead to
better performances and reduced hardware complexity when compared to uniform
filter bank. NUFB satisfying linear phase property for all the constituent
filters, are desirable in applications such as speech and image processing and
in communication. This paper proposes a novel design of non-uniform modified
discrete fourier transform filter bank (MDFT FB). Here, each non-uniform
channel is obtained by merging the nearby channels of a uniform MDFT FB. The
reported works of non-uniform cosine modulated filter banks (CMFBs) do not
satisfy linear phase property for all the constituent filters. In this work, we
introduce the design of a non-uniform MDFT FB which satisfies linear phase
property for all the constituent filters. The proposed design of the
non-uniform MDFT FB is checked utilizing the alias cancellation among the
channels, distortion and flatness condition of the channels. A condition is
derived to find the channels when merged with adjacent channels, will cause
aliasing in M channels. In the design and implementation of the proposed
non-uniform MDFT FB, the structure of the uniform MDFT filter bank is preserved
and hence all the advantages of MDFT FB over the DFT filter bank, are
guaranteed. Hence without increasing the design complexity, the non-uniform
MDFT FB is designed.

orthogonal drawings $\Gamma_I$ and $\Gamma_O$ of a connected graph $G$ while
preserving planarity, orthogonality, and the complexity of the drawing during
the morph. Necessarily drawings $\Gamma_I$ and $\Gamma_O$ must be equivalent,
that is, there exists a homeomorphism of the plane that transforms $\Gamma_I$
into $\Gamma_O$. Van Goethem and Verbeek use $O(n)$ linear morphs, where $n$ is
the maximum complexity of the input drawings. However, if the graph is
disconnected their method requires $O(n^{1.5})$ linear morphs. In this paper we
present a refined version of their approach that allows us to also morph

  Van Goethem and Verbeek measure the structural difference between the two

resulting morphs are quite natural and visually pleasing.

complementary view of LV performance that may aide in better assessing the
state of disease. Objectives: Using a high-resolution electro-mechanical (EM)
in silico model of the LV as a reference, we evaluated clinically feasible
Laplace-based methods for assessing global LV wall stresses and biomechanical
power. Methods: We used N = 4 in silico finite element (FE) EM models of LV and
aorta of patients suffering from AS. All models were personalized with clinical
data under pre-treatment conditions. LV wall stresses and biomechanical power
were computed accurately from FE kinematic data and compared to Laplace-based
estimation methods which were applied to the same FE model data. Results and
Conclusion: Laplace estimates of LV wall stress are able to provide a rough
approximation of global mean stress in the circumferential-longitudinal plane
of the LV. However, according to FE results spatial heterogeneity of stresses
in the LV wall is significant, leading to major discrepancies between local
stresses and global mean stress. Assessment of mechanical power with Laplace
methods is feasible, but these are inferior in accuracy compared to FE models.
The accurate assessment of stress and power density distribution in the LV wall
is only feasible based on patient-specific FE modeling.

ejection appeared in the field of view of SOHO/LASCO C2 about 40 minutes later.
Thanks to the high spatial resolution of IRIS data, bright plasma outflows

regionally but also achieves better performance than hydrological models that
were calibrated for each basin individually. Furthermore, we propose an
adaption to the standard LSTM architecture, which we call an Entity-Aware-LSTM

For a given observable fact in an image (e.g. the balloon's color), we generate
a set of logically consistent question-answer (QA) pairs (e.g. Is the balloon

with Laser Guide Star (LGS) tuned to a resonance of atmosphere sodium atoms.
This wavefront sensing technique presents complex issues for an application to

LGS, the launching angle, Tip-tilt indetermination and focus anisoplanatism.
The implementation of a laboratory Prototype for LGS wavefront sensor (WFS) at
the beginning of the phase study of MAORY, the Multi-conjugate Adaptive Optics
RelaY for the ELT first light, has been indispensable to investigate specific
mitigation strategies to the LGS WFS issues. This paper shows the test results
of LGS WFS Prototype under different working conditions. The accuracy within
which the LGS images are generated on the Shack-Hartmann (SH) WFS has been
cross-checked with the MAORY simulation code. The experiments show the effect
of noise on the centroiding precision, the impact of LGS image truncation on
the wavefront sensing accuracy as well as the temporal evolution of sodium
density profile and LGS image under-sampling.

systems Ax = b based on the Lanczos biorthogonalization process defined by
least-norm subproblems, and that is a natural companion to BiCG and QMR.
Whereas the BiCG (Fletcher, 1976), CGS (Sonneveld, 1989) and BiCGSTAB (van der
Vorst, 1992) iterates may not exist when the tridiagonal projection of A is
singular, BiLQ is reliable on compatible systems even if A is ill-conditioned
or rank deficient. As in the symmetric case, the BiCG residual is often smaller
than the BiLQ residual and, when the BiCG iterate exists, an inexpensive
transfer from the BiLQ iterate is possible. Although the Euclidean norm of the
BiLQ error is usually not monotonic, it is monotonic in a different norm that
depends on the Lanczos vectors. We establish a similar property for the QMR
(Freund and Nachtigal, 1991) residual. BiLQ combines with QMR to take advantage
of two initial vectors and solve a system and an adjoint system simultaneously
at a cost similar to that of applying either method. We derive an analogous
combination of USYMLQ and USYMQR based on the orthogonal tridiagonalization
process (Saunders, Simon, and Yip, 1988). The resulting combinations, named
BiLQR and TriLQR, may be used to estimate integral functionals involving the
solution of a primal and an adjoint system. We compare BiLQR and TriLQR with
Minres-qlp on a related augmented system, which performs a comparable amount of
work and requires comparable storage. In our experiments, BiLQR terminates
earlier than TriLQR and MINRES-QLP in terms of residual and error of the primal
and adjoint systems.

instance names (via character copying or transliteration), compounds (via
compositional translation), and cognates and loanwords (via phonological and

fact that creep is significant even for the shortest observable load durations.
Compared to the strain after 0.1 s load duration, the strain at 2 hour duration
is typically 53% greater. Most experimenters have for decades been unaware of
this fact. Consequently, the reported creep curves require correction by a time
shift, which ranges from 0 to 2 hours. This further implies a vertical shift of
entire creep curve, important for all times up to structure lifetime. To filter
out the errors, it is argued that, within an initial period during which the
advance of hydration is negligible, which is normally about 1 day, the initial
basic creep must follow a power law of the time. Creep test data from the
literature are used to prove it. Corrections by time and deformation shifts are
determined by minimization of the sum of squared deviations of the power law
from the creep test data. For a fixed exponent n and time shift s, the
optimization is reduced to linear regressions of two kinds, depending on
whether the data are given in terms of either the compliance function or the
creep coefficient. For both, the linear regression parameters depend
nonlinearly on the chosen values of n and s. To avoid nonlinear optimization,
which need not converge to the correct result, a set of many discrete values of
n and s within their realistic ranges is selected and the (n,s) combination
minimizing the objective function is obtained by a search. Enforcing a power
law form of the initial creep curve is found to lead to better data fits. The
optimum exponent n for the entire database is around 0.3, applicable to the
time period cca (10 s, 1 day). After that, the exponent transits to about 0.1,
and prior to that it is about 0.08.

and can be utilized in some crucial circumstances like battlegrounds,
commercial applications, habitat observing, buildings, smart homes, traffic
surveillance and other different places. One of the foremost difficulties that
WSN faces nowadays is protection from serious attacks. While organizing the
sensor nodes in an abandoned environment makes network systems helpless against
an assortment of strong assaults, intrinsic memory and power restrictions of
sensor nodes make the traditional security arrangements impractical. The
sensing knowledge combined with the wireless communication and processing power
makes it lucrative for being abused. The wireless sensor network technology
also obtains a big variety of security intimidations. This paper describes four
basic security threats and many active attacks on WSN with their possible
countermeasures proposed by different research scholars.

the pixel grid and computes a weighted sum. Our mapped convolution decouples
these two components, freeing the operation from the confines of the image grid
and allowing the kernel to process any type of structured data. As a test case,
we demonstrate its use by applying it to dense inference on spherical data. We
perform an in-depth study of existing spherical image convolution methods and
propose an improved sampling method for equirectangular images. Then, we
discuss the impact of data discretization when deriving a sampling function,
highlighting drawbacks of the cube map representation for spherical data.
Finally, we illustrate how mapped convolutions enable us to convolve directly
on a mesh by projecting the spherical image onto a geodesic grid and training
on the textured mesh. This method exceeds the state of the art for spherical
depth estimation by nearly 17%. Our findings suggest that mapped convolutions
can be instrumental in expanding the application scope of convolutional neural
networks.

improving the registration quality. The task of predicting registration error
is demanding due to the lack of a ground truth in medical images. This paper
proposes a new automatic method to predict the registration error in a
quantitative manner, and is applied to chest CT scans. A random regression
forest is utilized to predict the registration error locally. The forest is
built with features related to the transformation model and features related to
the dissimilarity after registration. The forest is trained and tested using
manually annotated corresponding points between pairs of chest CT scans in two
experiments: SPREAD (trained and tested on SPREAD) and inter-database
(including three databases SPREAD, DIR-Lab-4DCT and DIR-Lab-COPDgene). The
results show that the mean absolute errors of regression are 1.07 $\pm$ 1.86

respectively. The overall accuracy of classification in three classes (correct,
poor and wrong registration) is 90.7% and 75.4%, for SPREAD and inter-database

  Computation)",,,,cs.FL cs.LO math.GR,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  This work studies which storage mechanisms in automata permit decidability of
the emptiness problem. The question is formalized using valence automata, an
abstract model of automata in which the storage mechanism is given by a monoid.
For each of a variety of storage mechanisms, one can choose a (typically
infinite) monoid $M$ such that valence automata over $M$ are equivalent to
(one-way) automata with this type of storage. In fact, many important storage
mechanisms can be realized by monoids defined by finite graphs, called graph
monoids. Examples include pushdown stacks, partially blind counters (which
behave like Petri net places), blind counters (which may attain negative
values), and combinations thereof.
  Hence, we study for which graph monoids the emptiness problem for valence
automata is decidable. A particular model realized by graph monoids is that of
Petri nets with a pushdown stack. For these, decidability is a long-standing
open question and we do not answer it here.
  However, if one excludes subgraphs corresponding to this model, a
characterization can be achieved. Moreover, we provide a description of those
storage mechanisms for which decidability remains open. This leads to a model
that naturally generalizes both pushdown Petri nets and the priority
multicounter machines introduced by Reinhardt.
  The cases that are proven decidable constitute a natural and apparently new
extension of Petri nets with decidable reachability. It is finally shown that
this model can be combined with another such extension by Atig and Ganty: We
present a further decidability result that subsumes both of these Petri net
extensions.

reconstructs the scene in 360 x 180 from a sparse set of conventional images

of the space around the particles into separate Voronoi cells, e.g. applicable
to granular materials. A generalization of the conventional Voronoi diagram for
points or monodisperse spheres is the Set Voronoi diagram, also known as
navigational map or tessellation by zone of influence. In this construction, a
Set Voronoi cell contains the volume that is closer to the surface of one
particle than to the surface of any other particle. This is required for
aspherical or polydisperse systems.

supports common particle shapes and offers a generic mode, which allows to deal
with any type of particles that can be described mathematically. Pomelo can
create output in different standard formats, which allows direct visualization
and further processing. Finally, we describe three applications of the Set
Voronoi code in granular and soft matter physics, namely the problem of

friction, mechanical stable packings of tetrahedra and a model for liquid

It stores the
genesis of a material and determines all its physical and chemical properties.
While microstructural characterization is widely spread and well known, the
microstructural classification is mostly done manually by human experts, which
gives rise to uncertainties due to subjectivity. Since the microstructure could
be a combination of different phases or constituents with complex substructures
its automatic classification is very challenging and only a few prior studies
exist. Prior works focused on designed and engineered features by experts and
classified microstructures separately from the feature extraction step.
Recently, Deep Learning methods have shown strong performance in vision
applications by learning the features from data together with the
classification step. In this work, we propose a Deep Learning method for
microstructural classification in the examples of certain microstructural
constituents of low carbon steel. This novel method employs pixel-wise
segmentation via Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNN) accompanied by a
max-voting scheme. Our system achieves 93.94% classification accuracy,
drastically outperforming the state-of-the-art method of 48.89% accuracy.

Radio as a reliability enhancement feature. However, it is found to be resource
inefficient, since radio resources from more than one transmitters are required
to serve a single user. Improving the performance enhancement vs. resource
utilization tradeoff with MC is therefore a key design challenge. This work
proposes a heuristic resource efficient latency-aware dynamic MC algorithm
which activates MC selectively such that its benefits are harnessed for
critical users, while minimizing the corresponding resource usage. Numerical
results indicate that the proposed algorithm can deliver the outage performance
gains of legacy MC schemes while requiring up to 45% less resources.

skipping zeros. Taking advantage of sparsity is listed as a high priority in
next generation DNN accelerators such as TPU. The structure of sparsity, i.e.,
the granularity of pruning, affects the efficiency of hardware accelerator
design as well as the prediction accuracy. Coarse-grained pruning creates
regular sparsity patterns, making it more amenable for hardware acceleration
but more challenging to maintain the same accuracy. In this paper we
quantitatively measure the trade-off between sparsity regularity and prediction
accuracy, providing insights in how to maintain accuracy while having more a
more structured sparsity pattern. Our experimental results show that
coarse-grained pruning can achieve a sparsity ratio similar to unstructured
pruning without loss of accuracy. Moreover, due to the index saving effect,
coarse-grained pruning is able to obtain a better compression ratio than
fine-grained sparsity at the same accuracy threshold. Based on the recent
sparse convolutional neural network accelerator (SCNN), our experiments further
demonstrate that coarse-grained sparsity saves about 2x the memory references
compared to fine-grained sparsity. Since memory reference is more than two
orders of magnitude more expensive than arithmetic operations, the regularity
of sparse structure leads to more efficient hardware design.

applications. For multi-objective problems, it is useful not only to find one
solution but also to enumerate all the solutions with good values of
objectives. However, there are a vast number of graph partitions in a graph,
and thus it is difficult to enumerate desired graph partitions efficiently. In
this paper, an algorithm to enumerate all the graph partitions such that all
the weights of the connected components are at least a specified value is
proposed. To deal with a large search space, we use zero-suppressed binary
decision diagrams (ZDDs) to represent sets of graph partitions and we design a
new algorithm based on frontier-based search, which is a framework to directly
construct a ZDD. Our algorithm utilizes not only ZDDs but also ternary decision
diagrams (TDDs) and realizes an operation which seems difficult to be designed
only by ZDDs. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm runs up to
tens of times faster than an existing state-of-the-art algorithm.

two versions of the facility location problem with outliers proposed by

specifying the input: the input metric can be provided explicitly (as an $n

  - Implicit metric: For both problems, $O(1)$-approximation algorithms running
in $O(\mbox{poly}(\log n))$ rounds in the Congested Clique and the MPC model
and $O(1)$-approximation algorithms running in $\tilde{O}(n/k)$ rounds in the

learning for multiple agents using hierarchical graph attention network and
policy learning using multi-agent actor-critic. The hierarchical graph
attention network is specially designed to model the hierarchical relationships
among multiple agents that either cooperate or compete with each other to
derive more advanced strategic policies. Two attention networks, the
inter-agent and inter-group attention layers, are used to effectively model
individual and group level interactions, respectively. The two attention

tasks with different agent compositions and allow one to interpret the learned

information retrieval systems towards generating relevant results. Novel
approaches are required to reformat or expand user queries to generate a
satisfactory response and increase recall and precision. Query expansion (QE)
is a technique to broaden users' queries by introducing additional tokens or
phrases based on some semantic similarity metrics. The tradeoff is the added
computational complexity to find semantically similar words and a possible
increase in noise in information retrieval. Despite several research efforts on
this topic, QE has not yet been explored enough and more work is needed on
similarity matching and composition of query terms with an objective to
retrieve a small set of most appropriate responses. QE should be scalable,
fast, and robust in handling complex queries with a good response time and
noise ceiling. In this paper, we propose Xu, an automated QE technique, using
high dimensional clustering of word vectors and Datamuse API, an open source
query engine to find semantically similar words. We implemented Xu as a command

Conversely, maximum entropy can be invoked to retrieve the relevant variables
(sufficient statistics) directly from the data, once a model is identified by
Bayesian model selection. We explore this approach in the case of spin models
with interactions of arbitrary order, and we discuss how relevant interactions
can be inferred. In this perspective, the dimensionality of the inference
problem is not set by the number of parameters in the model, but by the
frequency distribution of the data. We illustrate the method showing its

  ice-templated TiO2 micro-structures",,,,,physics.app-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Ice-templating produces materials with aligned, elongated pores via
directional solidification of particle suspensions, sublimation of the
solidified fluid, and sintering of the particle walls. Most ice-templating
studies utilize upward solidification techniques, where solid ice is located at
the bottom of the solidification mold, the liquid suspension is on top of the
ice, and the solidification front advances upward, against gravity. Liquid
water reaches its maximum density at 4{\deg}C; thus, liquid nearest the cold
source is less dense than warmer liquid above. The lower density liquid nearest
the cold source is expected to rise due to buoyancy, promoting convective fluid
motion during solidification. Here, we investigate the effect of solidification
direction with respect to the direction of gravity on ice-templated
microstructures to study the role of buoyancy-driven fluid motion during
solidification. We hypothesize that, for upward solidification, the convective
fluid motion that results from a liquid density gradient occurs near the
solidification front. For downward solidification, we expect that this fluid
motion occurs farther away from the solidification front. Aqueous suspensions
of TiO2 nanoparticles are solidified upward (against gravity, with ice on
bottom and water on top), downward (water on bottom, ice on top), and
horizontally (perpendicular to gravity). Microstructural investigation of
sintered samples shows evidence of buoyancy-driven, convective fluid flow
during solidification for samples solidified upwards (against gravity),
including tilting of the wall (and pore) orientation with respect to the
induced temperature gradient, ice lens defects, and radial macrosegregation.
These features are not observed for downward nor horizontal solidification
configurations.

moving curve have two parameters, namely the position along the curve as well
as time. We therefore focus on similarity measures for surfaces, specifically
the Fr\'echet distance between surfaces. While the Fr\'echet distance between
surfaces is not even known to be computable, we show for variants arising in
the context of moving curves that they are polynomial-time solvable or
NP-complete depending on the restrictions imposed on how the moving curves are
matched. We achieve the polynomial-time solutions by a novel approach for
computing a surface in the so-called free-space diagram based on max-flow

establishing the concept of ""blockchain"" as a distributed ledger. As of today,
there are many different implementations of cryptocurrencies working over a
blockchain, with different approaches and philosophies. However, many of them
share one common feature: they require proof-of-work to support the generation
of blocks (mining) and, eventually, the generation of money. This proof-of-work
scheme often consists in the resolution of a cryptography problem, most
commonly breaking a hash value, which can only be achieved through brute-force.
The main drawback of proof-of-work is that it requires ridiculously large
amounts of energy which do not have any useful outcome beyond supporting the
currency. In this paper, we present a theoretical proposal that introduces a
proof-of-useful-work scheme to support a cryptocurrency running over a
blockchain, which we named Coin.AI. In this system, the mining scheme requires
training deep learning models, and a block is only mined when the performance
of such model exceeds a threshold. The distributed system allows for nodes to
verify the models delivered by miners in an easy way (certainly much more
efficiently than the mining process itself), determining when a block is to be
generated. Additionally, this paper presents a proof-of-storage scheme for
rewarding users that provide storage for the deep learning models, as well as a
theoretical dissertation on how the mechanics of the system could be
articulated with the ultimate goal of democratizing access to artificial
intelligence.

but whether the cross-sectional scaling law is applicable to the temporal
growth of individual cities is unclear. Here we first find two paradoxical
scaling relationships that urban built-up area sub-linearly scales with
population across cities, but super-linearly scales with population over time
in most individual cities because urban land expands faster than population
grows. Different cities have diverse temporal scaling exponents and one city
even has opposite temporal scaling regimes during two periods, strongly
supporting the absence of single temporal scaling and further illustrating the
failure of cross-sectional urban scaling in predicting temporal growth of
cities. We propose a conceptual model that can clarify the essential difference
and also connections between the cross-sectional scaling law and temporal
trajectories of cities. Our model shows that cities have an extra growth of
built-up area over time besides the supposed growth predicted by the
cross-sectional scaling law. Disparities of extra growth among different-sized
cities change the cross-sectional scaling exponent. Further analyses of GDP and
other indicators confirm the contradiction between cross-sectional and temporal
scaling relationships and the validity of the conceptual model. Our findings
may open a new avenue towards the science of cities.

cell network, where small cells obtain the required energy for providing
wireless services to users through ambient energy harvesting. Since energy
harvesting is opportunistic in nature, the amount of harvested energy is a

as a competitive market with uncertainty, where self-interested small cells,
modeled as consumers, are willing to maximize their utility scores by selecting
users, represented by commodities. The utility scores of small cells depend on
the amount of harvested energy, formulated as natures' state. Under this model,
the problem is to assign users to small cells, so that the aggregate network
utility is maximized. The solution is the general equilibrium under
uncertainty, also called Arrow-Debreu equilibrium. We show that in our setting,
such equilibrium not only exists, but also is unique and is Pareto optimal in

detector simulation of such a large detector is time-consuming and challenging.
It is necessary to take full advantages of parallel computing to speedup

Even though based on pthread, it could be extended with other libraries such as
Intel TBB. Therefore it is possible to parallelize JUNO simulation framework

or other modes. The SNiPER task component is in charge of event loop, which is
like a simplified application manager. Two types of tasks are introduced in the

task will run only once to initialize detector geometry and physics processes.
The worker tasks will be spawned after global task is done. In each worker
task, a Geant4 run manager is invoked to do the real simulation. Therefore the

Still, fast practical implementations of the Fr\'echet distance, in particular

flux and recently found evidence for neutrino emission from the blazar TXS
0506+056. These results open a new window into the high-energy universe.
However, the source or sources of most of the observed flux of astrophysical
neutrinos remains uncertain. Here, a search for steady point-like neutrino
sources is performed using an unbinned likelihood analysis. The method searches
for a spatial accumulation of muon-neutrino events using the very
high-statistics sample of about $497\,000$ neutrinos recorded by IceCube
between 2009 and 2017. The median angular resolution is $\sim1^\circ$ at 1 TeV
and improves to $\sim0.3^\circ$ for neutrinos with an energy of 1 PeV. Compared
to previous analyses, this search is optimized for point-like neutrino emission
with the same flux-characteristics as the observed astrophysical muon-neutrino
flux and introduces an improved event-reconstruction and parametrization of the
background. The result is an improvement in sensitivity to the muon-neutrino
flux compared to the previous analysis of $\sim35\%$ assuming an $E^{-2}$
spectrum. The sensitivity on the muon-neutrino flux is at a level of $E^2
\mathrm{d} N /\mathrm{d} E = 3\cdot
10^{-13}\,\mathrm{TeV}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. No new evidence for
neutrino sources is found in a full sky scan and in an a priori candidate
source list that is motivated by gamma-ray observations. Furthermore, no
significant excesses above background are found from populations of
sub-threshold sources. The implications of the non-observation for potential
source classes are discussed.

full-gradients, which decomposes the neural net response into input sensitivity
and per-neuron sensitivity components. This is the first proposed
representation which satisfies two key properties: completeness and weak
dependence, which provably cannot be satisfied by any saliency map-based
interpretability method. For convolutional nets, we also propose an approximate
saliency map representation, called FullGrad, obtained by aggregating the
full-gradient components.
  We experimentally evaluate the usefulness of FullGrad in explaining model
behaviour with two quantitative tests: pixel perturbation and
remove-and-retrain. Our experiments reveal that our method explains model
behaviour correctly, and more comprehensively than other methods in the
literature. Visual inspection also reveals that our saliency maps are sharper
and more tightly confined to object regions than other methods.

including quantum computing and quantum communications. Atomic defects in
hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) have recently emerged as new room-temperature
single-photon emitters in solid-state systems, but the development of scalable
and tunable h-BN single-photon emitters requires external methods that can
control the emission energy of individual defects. Here, by fabricating van der
Waals heterostructures of h-BN and graphene, we demonstrate the electrical
control of single-photon emission from atomic defects in h-BN via the Stark
effect. By applying an out-of-plane electric field through graphene gates, we
observed Stark shifts as large as 5.4 nm per GV/m. The Stark shift generated
upon a vertical electric field suggests the existence of out-of-plane dipole
moments associated with atomic defect emitters, which is supported by
first-principles theoretical calculations. Furthermore, we found field-induced
discrete modification and stabilization of emission intensity, which were
reversibly controllable with an external electric field.

this paper introduces two cases of applying the Value Sensitive Design
methodology to learning analytics design. The first study applied two methods
of Value Sensitive Design, namely stakeholder analysis and value analysis, to a
conceptual investigation of an existing learning analytics tool. This
investigation uncovered a number of values and value tensions, leading to
design trade-offs to be considered in future tool refinements. The second study
holistically applied Value Sensitive Design to the design of a recommendation
system for the Wikipedia WikiProjects. To proactively consider values among
stakeholders, we derived a multi-stage design process that included literature
analysis, empirical investigations, prototype development, community
engagement, iterative testing and refinement, and continuous evaluation. By
reporting on these two cases, this paper responds to a need of practical means
to support ethical considerations and human values in learning analytics
systems. These two cases demonstrate that Value Sensitive Design could be a
viable approach for balancing a wide range of human values, which tend to
encompass and surpass ethical issues, in learning analytics design.

collided with the heliopause, generating a pressure pulse that propagated into
the very local interstellar medium. The effects of the transmitted wave were
seen by Voyager 1 just 93 days after its own heliopause crossing. The passage
of the transient was accompanied by long-lasting decreases in galactic cosmic
ray intensities that occurred from ~2012.55 to ~2013.35 and ~2012.91 to
~2013.70 at Voyager 2 and Voyager 1, respectively. Omnidirectional (>20 MeV)
proton-dominated measurements from each spacecraft's Cosmic Ray Subsystem
reveal a remarkable similarity between these causally-related events, with a
correlation coefficient of 91.2% and a time-lag of 130 days. Knowing the
locations of the two spacecraft, we use the observed time-delay to calculate
the GMIR's average speed through the heliosheath (inside the heliopause) as a
function of temperature in the very local interstellar medium. This, combined
with particle, field, and plasma observations enables us to infer previously
unmeasured properties of the heliosheath, including a range of sound speeds and
total effective pressures. For a nominal temperature of ~20,000 K just outside
the heliopause, we find a sound speed of 314 (+/-) 32 km/s and total effective
pressure of 267 (+/-) 55 fPa inside the heliopause. We compare these results
with the Interstellar Boundary Explorer's data-driven models of heliosheath

supporting the 5G mobile system. By deploying more small cells in a fixed area,
the average distance between users and access points can be significantly
reduced, hence a dense spatial frequency reuse can be exploited. However,
severe interference is the major obstacle in UDN. Most of the contributions
deal with the interference by relying on cooperative game theory. This paper
advocates the application of dense user-centric C-RAN philosophy to UDN, thanks
to the recent development of cloud computing techniques. Under dense C-RAN,
centralized signal processing can be invoked for supporting CoMP transmission.
We summarize the main challenges in dense user-centric C-RANs. One of the most
challenging issues is the requirement of the global CSI for the sake of
cooperative transmission. We investigate this requirement by only relying on
partial CSI, namely, on inter-cluster large-scale CSI. Furthermore, the
estimation of the intra-cluster CSI is considered, including the pilot
allocation and robust transmission. Finally, we highlight several promising
research directions to make the dense user-centric C-RAN become a reality, with
special emphasis on the application of the `big data' techniques.

demonstrate twofold enhancement of the QD photocurrent in the ELO QD cell
compared to the wafer-based QD cell. In the GaAs wavelength range, the ELO QD
cell perfectly preserves the current collection efficiency of the baseline
single-junction ELO cell. We demonstrate by full-wave optical simulations that
integrating a micro-patterned diffraction grating in the ELO cell rearside
provides more than tenfold enhancement of the near-infrared light harvesting by
QDs. Experimental results are thoroughly discussed with the help of
physics-based simulations to single out the impact of QD dynamics and defects
on the cell photovoltaic behavior. It is demonstrated that non radiative
recombination in the QD stack is the bottleneck for the open circuit voltage
($V_{oc}$) of the reported devices. More important, our theoretical
calculations demonstrate that the $V_{oc}$ offest of 0.3 V from the QD ground
state identified by \emph{Tanabe et al., 2012}, from a collection of
experimental data of high quality III-V QD solar cells is a reliable - albeit
conservative - metric to gauge the attainable $V_{oc}$ and to quantify the
scope for improvement by reducing non radiative recombination. Provided that
material quality issues are solved, we demonstrate - by transport and rigorous
electromagnetic simulations - that light-trapping enhanced thin-film cells with

study the problem of efficient UAV placement, where the objective is to
minimize the total transmit power required to cover the entire high-rise

efficient solutions to the formulated problem under these cases. In the first
case, we aim to find the minimum transmit power such that an indoor user with
the maximum path loss can be covered. In the second case, we assume that the

learning for the formalization of knowledge. Here, I propose an approach to
this problem that is general, intuitive, and flexible. It is based on a unique

sentences that are atomic, independent, declarative, and absolute. Such
sentences can then serve as nodes in a network of scientific claims linked to

Exploiting this graphical structure in multiple testing procedures can improve
power as well as aid in interpretation. However, incorporating the structure

false discovery rate (FDR), is controlled can be challenging. In this paper, we
introduce a new general approach for large scale multiple testing, which can
aid in developing new procedures under various settings with proven control of
desired error rates. This approach is particularly useful for developing FDR
controlling procedures, which is simplified as the problem of developing
per-family error rate (PFER) controlling procedures. Specifically, for testing
hypotheses with a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure, by using the general
approach, under the assumption of independence, we first develop a specific
PFER controlling procedure and based on this procedure, then develop a new FDR
controlling procedure, which can preserve the desired DAG structure among the
rejected hypotheses. Through a small simulation study and a real data analysis,
we illustrate nice performance of the proposed FDR controlling procedure for
DAG-structured hypotheses.

  Leifert",End-To-End Measure for Text Recognition,to appear in proceeding at ICDAR 2019,,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Measuring the performance of text recognition and text line detection engines
is an important step to objectively compare systems and their configuration.
There exist well-established measures for both tasks separately. However, there
is no sophisticated evaluation scheme to measure the quality of a combined text
line detection and text recognition system. The F-measure on word level is a
well-known methodology, which is sometimes used in this context. Nevertheless,
it does not take into account the alignment of hypothesis and ground truth text
and can lead to deceptive results. Since users of automatic information
retrieval pipelines in the context of text recognition are mainly interested in
the end-to-end performance of a given system, there is a strong need for such a
measure. Hence, we present a measure to evaluate the quality of an end-to-end
text recognition system. The basis for this measure is the well established and
widely used character error rate, which is limited -- in its original form --
to aligned hypothesis and ground truth texts. The proposed measure is flexible
in a way that it can be configured to penalize different reading orders between
the hypothesis and ground truth and can take into account the geometric
position of the text lines. Additionally, it can ignore over- and under-
segmentation of text lines. With these parameters it is possible to get a
measure fitting best to its own needs.

Design Report. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is one of the largest scientific
instruments ever built. Since opening up a new energy frontier for exploration
in 2010, it has gathered a global user community of about 7,000 scientists
working in fundamental particle physics and the physics of hadronic matter at
extreme temperature and density. To sustain and extend its discovery potential,
the LHC will need a major upgrade in the 2020s. This will increase its
luminosity (rate of collisions) by a factor of five beyond the original design
value and the integrated luminosity (total collisions created) by a factor ten.
The LHC is already a highly complex and exquisitely optimised machine so this
upgrade must be carefully conceived and will require about ten years to
implement. The new configuration, known as High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), will
rely on a number of key innovations that push accelerator technology beyond its
present limits. Among these are cutting-edge 11-12 tesla superconducting
magnets, compact superconducting cavities for beam rotation with ultra-precise
phase control, new technology and physical processes for beam collimation and
300 metre-long high-power superconducting links with negligible energy
dissipation. The present document describes the technologies and components
that will be used to realise the project and is intended to serve as the basis
for the detailed engineering design of HL-LHC.

For each topic, the report includes a list of tangible actions that were
proposed and that would lead to potential change. The workshop recognized that
reliance on scientific software is pervasive in all areas of world-leading
research today. The workshop participants then proceeded to explore different
perspectives on the concept of sustainability. Key enablers and barriers of
sustainable scientific software were identified from their experiences. In
addition, recommendations with new requirements such as software credit files
and software prize frameworks were outlined for improving practices in
sustainable software engineering. There was also broad consensus that formal
training in software development or engineering was rare among the
practitioners. Significant strides need to be made in building a sense of
community via training in software and technical practices, on increasing their
size and scope, and on better integrating them directly into graduate education
programs. Finally, journals can define and publish policies to improve
reproducibility, whereas reviewers can insist that authors provide sufficient

automated camera networks that monitor the sky for fireballs. One of the goals
of these networks is to provide the necessary information for linking
meteorites to their pre-impact, heliocentric orbits and ultimately to their
source regions in the solar system. We re-compute heliocentric orbits for the
25 meteorite falls published to date from original data sources. Using these
orbits, we constrain their most likely escape routes from the main asteroid
belt and the cometary region by utilizing a state-of-the-art orbit model of the
near-Earth-object population, which includes a size-dependence in delivery
efficiency. While we find that our general results for escape routes are
comparable to previous work, the role of trajectory measurement uncertainty in
escape-route identification is explored for the first time. Moreover, our
improved size-dependent delivery model substantially changes likely escape
routes for several meteorite falls, most notably Tagish Lake which seems
unlikely to have originated in the outer main belt as previously suggested. We
find that reducing the uncertainty of fireball velocity measurements below
$\sim0.1$ km/s does not lead to reduced uncertainties in the identification of
their escape routes from the asteroid belt and, further, their ultimate source
regions. This analysis suggests that camera networks should be optimized for
the largest possible number of meteorite recoveries with measured speed
precisions of order 0.1 km/s.

measure the behavioral distance of states.
  A crucial step is the lifting of the functor $H$ on $\mathrm{Set}$ to a
functor $\overline{H}$ on the category $\mathrm{PMet}$ of pseudometric spaces.
We present two different approaches which can be viewed as generalizations of
the Kantorovich and Wasserstein pseudometrics for probability measures. We show
that the pseudometrics provided by the two approaches coincide on several
natural examples, but in general they differ.
  If $H$ has a final coalgebra, every lifting $\overline{H}$ yields in a
canonical way a behavioral distance which is usually branching-time, i.e., it
generalizes bisimilarity. In order to model linear-time metrics (generalizing
trace equivalences), we show sufficient conditions for lifting distributive
laws and monads. These results enable us to employ the generalized powerset
construction.

evolution and breaking of a large amplitude relativistically intense electron
plasma wave has been studied, using a 1-D relativistic Particle-in-Cell (PIC)
code. We have found that for phase velocities for which $\gamma _\phi \ll 1 +
\frac{k_BT_e}{mc^2}$, the wave damps within a few plasma period and essentially
follows the relativistic Landau Damping rate predicted by Buti. In the opposite
regime (i.e. for $\gamma _\phi \gg 1 + \frac{k_BT_e}{mc^2}$) we have observed
that waves propagate through the system for a long period of time and in small
amplitude limit follow the relativistic warm plasma dispersion relation.
Further we have demonstrated that in the same regime (i.e. for $\gamma _\phi
\gg 1 + \frac{k_BT_e}{mc^2}$), for the phase velocities less than the velocity
of light $c$, like the cold plasma Akhiezer - Polovin wave, in a warm plasma
also, relativistically intense waves break via phase mixing when perturbed by
an arbitrarily small amplitude longitudinal perturbation. Using the simulation
results, we have also shown that the phase mixing time scale in a warm plasma
can be interpreted using Dawson's formula for phase mixing time for a
non-relativistic cold inhomogeneous plasma, which is based on out of phase
motion of neighbouring oscillators constituting the wave.

  Prompt emission from \thisgrb\ was very bright (fluence
$>10^{-4}$~ergs~cm$^{-2}$) and had a complex structure composed of the
superimposition of several pulses. The energy spectra deviate from the typical
Band function to show a low energy peak $\sim 15$~keV --- which we interpret as
a power-law with two breaks, with a synchrotron origin. Alternately, the prompt
spectra can also be interpreted as Comptonized emission, or a blackbody
combined with a Band function. Time-resolved analysis confirms the presence of
the low energy component, while the peak energy is found to be confined in the
range of 100--200~keV.
  Afterglow emission detected by \fermi-LAT is typical of an external shock
model, and we constrain the initial Lorentz factor using the peak time of the
emission. \swift-XRT measurements of the afterglow show an indication for a jet
break, allowing us to constrain the jet opening angle to $>$ 6$\degr$.
  Detection of a large number of Compton scattered events by \asat-CZTI

emission. We find that the burst has high, time-variable polarization, with the

However, these metrics continue to remain popular and are recently being used

by the sign of the ratio of the dispersive coefficient to the nonlinear one. It

practice. The use of a prediction-based decision rule should be formalized and
compared to the standard of care in a randomized trial to assess its clinical

  Our analysis has identified several key differences in propagation behavior

highly active users responsible for the majority of disinformation spread
overall and within each demographic. Analysis by demographics showed that users

quickly from trusted, conspiracy, and disinformation sources compared to

likely to share from propaganda accounts, but not the other way around.

Our fluid contains an
adiabatic part plus a bulk viscous one. The adiabatic part has the ability to
asymptote between two power laws and so can interpolate between the dust and
dark energy equations of state at early and late times. The dissipative part is
a bulk viscous part with constant viscosity coefficient. The model is analyzed
using the phase space methodology which helps to understand the dynamical
behavior of the model in a robust manner without reference to the system
solution. The parameters of the model are constrained through its asymptotic
behavior and also through many observational constraints. We solve the Hubble
parameter equation using numerical methods and results are plotted against the
newest set of Hubble data. The model is tested using the $Om(z)$ test which
shows that this model although is a quintessence-like model, it slides through
the phantom barrier. We study the model expectations for the evolution of the
universe by studying the evolution of the deceleration parameter, the density
of the universe, the effective equation of state parameter of the model and of
its underlying dark energy package. We estimate the value of the present day
viscosity coefficient of the cosmic fluid as $8 \times 10^6 Pa.s$, which agrees
with the work of many authors, e.g., Velten and Schwartz [26], Wang and Meng
[27], and Sasidharan and Mathew [29]. We argue that this model is able to

  Privacy Theory","5 pages, 1 table",,,,cs.CR cs.RO,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The use of connected surgical robotics to automate medical procedures
presents new privacy challenges. We argue that conventional patient consent
protocols no longer work. Indeed robots that replace human surgeons take on an
extraordinary level of responsibility. Surgeons undergo years of training and
peer review in a strongly regulated environment, and derive trust via a
patient's faith in the hospital system. Robots on the other hand derive trust
differently, via the integrity of the software that governs their operation.
From a privacy perspective, there are two fundamental shifts. First, the threat
model has shifted from one where the humans involved were untrusted to one
where the robotic software is untrusted. Second, the basic unit of privacy
control is no longer a medical record, but is replaced by four new basic units:
the subject on which the robot is taking action; the tools used by the robot;
the sensors (i.e data) the robot can access; and, finally access to monitoring
and calibration services which afford correct operation of the robot. We
suggest that contextual privacy provides useful theoretical tools to solve the
privacy problems posed by surgical robots. However, it also poses some
challenges: not least that the complexity of the contextual-privacy policies,
if rigorously specified to achieve verification and enforceability, will be
exceedingly high to directly expose to humans that review contextual privacy
policies. A medical robot works with both information and physical material.
While informational norms allow for judgements about contextual integrity and
the transmission principle governs the constraints applied on information
transfer, nothing is said about material property. Certainly, contextual
privacy provides an anchor for useful notions of privacy in this scenario and
thus should be considered to be extended to cover both information and material
flows.

nested-grid, high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of gas and particle
dynamics in the vicinity of an Earth-mass planetary embryo. We include heating
due to the accretion of solids and the subsequent convective motions. Using a
constant embryo surface temperature, we show that radiative energy transport
results in a tendency to reduce the entropy in the primordial atmosphere, but
this tendency is alleviated by an increase in the strength of convective energy
transport, triggered by a correspondingly increased super-adiabatic temperature
gradient. As a consequence, the amplitude of the convective motions increase by
roughly an order of magnitude in the vicinity of the embryo. In the cases
investigated here, where the optical depth towards the disk surface is larger
than unity, the reduction of the temperature in the outer parts of the Hill
sphere relative to cases without radiative energy transport is only $\sim$100K,
while the mass density increase is on the order of a factor of two in the inner
parts of the Hill sphere. Our results demonstrate that, unless unrealistically
low dust opacities are assumed, radiative cooling in the context of primordial
rocky planet atmospheres can only become important after the disk surface
density has dropped significantly below minimum-mass-solar-nebula values.

operator and the other randomly selects any operator. Several experiments on
some Travelling Salesman Problems (TSP) have been conducted to evaluate the
proposed methods, which are compared to the well-known Modified crossover

  human capital in moroccan hotels",,,,,cs.CY q-fin.GN,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The growth of the modern knowledge-based economy is becoming less and less
dependent on tangible assets and more on intangible ones. In this context, the
role of human capital in the value creation process has become central. Despite
the large amount of scientific work on human capital phenomena, little research
has revealed the role of human capital in the process of creating value. The
purpose of this article is to evaluate the impact of human capital on value
creation within 31 classified hotels in Morocco for the period 2013-2015. This
paper is organized into four sections. First, we return to the main
conceptualization of value creation. The goal of this first section is to
synthesize prior work on this construct and highlight the main role of the
resource based view (RBV) in explaining it. This view presents the point that
links value creation to human capital given that this latter concept is one of
the most resources of the firm. Next, we present the main definition of human
capital. To do so, we make use of concepts from psychology, economy and
strategic human resource management. Then, we shed light on the existing
relationship between the two concepts of our research. Finally, we present the
methodology of this research as well as the results. The required data to
calculate value creation is obtained mainly from the annual reports of Moroccan
hotels. Whereas, human capital is assessed by a questionnaire using the scale
of Subramaniam and Youndt (2005). Data is examined using linear regression by
PASW statistics software. The results of this study give a more concrete
picture on the creation of value in this context and refute any link between
these two concepts.

most implementations of the PEA are based on qubits, where the computational

computing tasks with higher dimensional states -- qudits -- has been proposed,
yet a qudit-based PEA has not been realized. Using qudits can reduce the
resources needed for achieving a given precision or success probability.
Compared to other quantum computing hardware, photonic systems have the
advantage of being resilient to noise, but the probabilistic nature of
photon-photon interaction makes it difficult to realize two-photon controlled
gates that are necessary components in many quantum algorithms. In this work,
we report an experimental realization of a qudit-based PEA on a photonic
platform, utilizing the high dimensionality in time and frequency degrees of
freedom (DoFs) in a single photon. The controlled-unitary gates can be realized
in a deterministic fashion, as the control and target registers are now
represented by two DoFs in a single photon. This first implementation of a
qudit PEA, on any platform, successfully retrieves any arbitrary phase with one
ternary digit of precision.

an instance $I$ of size $N$ over a universe $U_I$ of size $n$ and the task is
to check whether the universe contains a subset with property $\Phi$ (e.g.,
$\Phi$ could be the property of being a feedback vertex set for the input graph
of size at most $k$). Our main tool is a simple randomized algorithm which
solves $\Phi$-Subset in time $(1+b-\frac{1}{c})^n N^{O(1)}$, provided that
there is an algorithm for the $\Phi$-Extension problem with running time
$b^{n-|X|} c^k N^{O(1)}$. Here, the input for $\Phi$-Extension is an instance
$I$ of size $N$ over a universe $U_I$ of size $n$, a subset $X\subseteq U_I$,
and an integer $k$, and the task is to check whether there is a set $Y$ with
$X\subseteq Y \subseteq U_I$ and $|Y\setminus X|\le k$ with property $\Phi$. We
derandomize this algorithm at the cost of increasing the running time by a
subexponential factor in $n$, and we adapt it to the enumeration setting where
we need to enumerate all subsets of the universe with property $\Phi$. This
generalizes the results of Fomin et al. [STOC 2016] who proved the case where
$b=1$. As case studies, we use these results to design faster deterministic
algorithms for: - checking whether a graph has a feedback vertex set of size at
most $k$ - enumerating all minimal feedback vertex sets - enumerating all
minimal vertex covers of size at most $k$, and - enumerating all minimal
3-hitting sets. We obtain these results by deriving new $b^{n-|X|} c^k
N^{O(1)}$-time algorithms for the corresponding $\Phi$-Extension problems (or
enumeration variant). In some cases, this is done by adapting the analysis of
an existing algorithm, or in other cases by designing a new algorithm. Our
analyses are based on Measure and Conquer, but the value to minimize,
$1+b-\frac{1}{c}$, is unconventional and requires non-convex optimization.

  Time-to-failure Modeling",Accepted at IEEE International Conference on BigData 2018,,,,cs.LG stat.ML,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  One of the key challenges in predictive maintenance is to predict the
impending downtime of an equipment with a reasonable prediction horizon so that
countermeasures can be put in place. Classically, this problem has been posed
in two different ways which are typically solved independently: (1) Remaining
useful life (RUL) estimation as a long-term prediction task to estimate how
much time is left in the useful life of the equipment and (2) Failure
prediction (FP) as a short-term prediction task to assess the probability of a
failure within a pre-specified time window. As these two tasks are related,
performing them separately is sub-optimal and might results in inconsistent
predictions for the same equipment. In order to alleviate these issues, we
propose two methods: Deep Weibull model (DW-RNN) and multi-task learning
(MTL-RNN). DW-RNN is able to learn the underlying failure dynamics by fitting
Weibull distribution parameters using a deep neural network, learned with a
survival likelihood, without training directly on each task. While DW-RNN makes
an explicit assumption on the data distribution, MTL-RNN exploits the implicit
relationship between the long-term RUL and short-term FP tasks to learn the
underlying distribution. Additionally, both our methods can leverage the
non-failed equipment data for RUL estimation. We demonstrate that our methods
consistently outperform baseline RUL methods that can be used for FP while
producing consistent results for RUL and FP. We also show that our methods
perform at par with baselines trained on the objectives optimized for either of
the two tasks.

channels, each with specific considerations in the choice of their reporting.
Although the multiplicity of these outlets should ensure a variety of
viewpoints, recent reports suggest that the rising concentration of media
ownership may void this assumption. This observation motivates the study of the
impact of ownership on the global media landscape and its influence on the
coverage the actual viewer receives. To this end, the selection of reported
events has been shown to be informative about the high-level structure of the
news ecosystem. However, existing methods only provide a static view into an
inherently dynamic system, providing underperforming statistical models and
hindering our understanding of the media landscape as a whole.
  In this work, we present a dynamic embedding method that learns to capture
the decision process of individual news sources in their selection of reported
events while also enabling the systematic detection of large-scale
transformations in the media landscape over prolonged periods of time. In an
experiment covering over 580M real-world event mentions, we show our approach
to outperform static embedding methods in predictive terms. We demonstrate the
potential of the method for news monitoring applications and investigative
journalism by shedding light on important changes in programming induced by
mergers and acquisitions, policy changes, or network-wide content diffusion.
These findings offer evidence of strong content convergence trends inside large
broadcasting groups, influencing the news ecosystem in a time of increasing

unravel such interactions based on the potentiometric mapping in the riverbank.
We had 60 stop sites along the riverbank for groundwater and river water level
observations, and chemical measurements (TDS, EC, temp, and pH). Three river
water gauge were also analyzed to see the fluctuations.
  We identified three types of hydrodynamic relationships with fairly low flow
gradients: effluent flow at Segmen I (Kranggan - Batuceper) with 0.2-0.25
gradient, perched flow at Segmen II (Batuceper-Kalibaru) with gradient
0.2-0.25, and influent flow at Segmen III (Kalibaru-Tanjungburung) with
gradient 0.15-0.20. Such low flow gradient is controlled by the moderate to low
morphological slope in the area. The gaining and losing stream model were also
supported by the river water fluctuation data. TDS and EC readings increased
more than 40$\%$ from upstream to downstream. At some points the both
measurements were two times higher than the permissible limits, along with the
drops of pH values at those areas.
  This study shows the very close interaction between Cisadane river water and

diseases and identifying abnormalities in chest radiography. In this work,
instead of learning from medical imaging data with region-level annotations,
our model was merely trained on imaging data with image-level labels to
classify diseases, and is able to identify abnormal image regions
simultaneously. Our model consists of a customized pooling structure and an
adaptive DenseNet front-end, which can effectively recognize possible disease
features for classification and localization tasks. Our method has been
validated on the publicly available ChestX-ray14 dataset. Experimental results
have demonstrated that our classification and localization prediction
performance achieved significant improvement over the previous models on the
ChestX-ray14 dataset. In summary, our network can produce accurate disease
classification and localization, which can potentially support clinical
decisions.

still unclear how politicians use different social media platforms in political
communication. Focusing on the German federal election campaign 2013, this
article investigates whether election candidates address the topics most
important to the mass audience and to which extent their communication is
shaped by the characteristics of Facebook and Twitter. Based on open-ended
responses from a representative survey conducted during the election campaign,
we train a human-interpretable Bayesian language model to identify political
topics. Applying the model to social media messages of candidates and their
direct audiences, we find that both prioritize different topics than the mass
audience. The analysis also shows that politicians use Facebook and Twitter for
different purposes. We relate the various findings to the mediation of
political communication on social media induced by the particular
characteristics of audiences and sociotechnical environments.

Firstly, our agent did not learn from any demonstrations. Secondly, our agent
is highly reproducible. As a technical report, we articulate the design of

volatility the IF gain (or loss) caused by a single paper, and this is
inversely proportional to journal size. We find high volatilities for hundreds
of journals annually due to their top-cited paper: whether it is a highly-cited
paper in a small journal, or a moderately (or even low) cited paper in a small

boost their IF by more than 20%, while for 231 journals the boost exceeded 50%.
We find that small journals are rewarded much more than large journals for
publishing a highly-cited paper, and are also penalized more for publishing a
low-cited paper, especially if they have a high IF. This produces a strong
incentive for prestigious, high-IF journals to stay small, to remain
competitive in IF rankings. We discuss the implications for breakthrough papers
to appear in prestigious journals. We also question the practice of ranking

one to find the optimal cost for multiple vertices in one iteration and thereby
reduces the sequential bottleneck in Dijkstra's algorithm.
  We present four algorithms in this paper --- $SP_1$, $SP_2$, $SP_3$ and
$SP_4$. $SP_1$ and $SP_2$ reduce the number of heap operations in Dijkstra's
algorithm. For directed acyclic graphs, or directed unweighted graphs they have
the optimal complexity of $O(e)$ where $e$ is the number of edges in the graph

worst case complexity matches that of Dijkstra's algorithm for a sequential

infrastructure capable of supporting massive courses. The infrastructure should
encourage students to apply the key software engineering (SE) practices -
automated testing, con guration management, and Integrated Development
Environment (IDE) - and acquire the basic skills for using the corresponding
tools. We selected a few widely adopted development tools used to support the
key software engineering practices and mapped them to the basic activities in
our exam assignment management process. This experience report describes the

domains is a challenging problem. ADEM(Lowe et al. 2017) formulated the
automatic evaluation of dialogue systems as a learning problem and showed that
such a model was able to predict responses which correlate significantly with
human judgements, both at utterance and system level. Their system was shown to
have beaten word-overlap metrics such as BLEU with large margins. We start with
the question of whether an adversary can game the ADEM model. We design a
battery of targeted attacks at the neural network based ADEM evaluation system
and show that automatic evaluation of dialogue systems still has a long way to
go. ADEM can get confused with a variation as simple as reversing the word
order in the text! We report experiments on several such adversarial scenarios
that draw out counterintuitive scores on the dialogue responses. We take a
systematic look at the scoring function proposed by ADEM and connect it to
linear system theory to predict the shortcomings evident in the system. We also
devise an attack that can fool such a system to rate a response generation
system as favorable. Finally, we allude to future research directions of using
the adversarial attacks to design a truly automated dialogue evaluation system.

excess, which can be described only by extremizing the existing relations
between the shape of their ultraviolet continuum emission and their
infrared-to-ultraviolet luminosity ratio, or by constructing \textit{ad-hoc}
models of star formation and dust distribution. We present an alternative
explanation, based on unveiled AGN activity, to the existence of such galaxies.
In fact, the presence of a weak AGN configures as a natural scenario in order
to explain the observed spectral properties of such high-$z$ objects in terms
of a continuum slope distribution rather than altered infrared excesses, due to
the different shape of the AGN continuum emission with respect to quiescent
galaxies. To this aim, we directly compare the infrared-to-ultraviolet
properties of high-redshift galaxies to those of known categories of AGN
(quasars and Seyferts). We also infer the characteristics of their possible
X-ray emission. We find a strong similarity between the spectral shapes and
luminosity ratios of AGN with the corresponding properties of such galaxies. In
addition, we derive expected X-ray fluxes that are compatible with energetics
from AGN activity. We conclude that a moderate AGN contribution to the UV
emission of such high-$z$ objects is a valid alternative to explain their
spectral properties. Even the presence of an active nucleus in each source
would not violate the expected quasar statistics. Furthermore, we suggest that
the observed similarities between anomalous star-forming galaxies and quasars
may provide a benchmark for future theoretical and observational studies on the
galaxy population in the early Universe.

at each given grid point. Unlike the existing RSSs based algorithms, several
representative machine learning approaches are adopted to train multiple

localization estimators outperform the classical RSS-based LED localization
approaches in accuracy and robustness. To further improve the localization
performance, two robust fusion localization algorithms, namely, grid

probability index. This index is defined as $P(Y \leq Y^*|X, X^*)$ where Y and
Y* are independent random response variables associated with covariates X and
X* [...] Crucially to estimate the parameters of the model, a set of
pseudo-observations is constructed. For a sample size n, a total of $n(n-1)/2$
pairwise comparisons between observations is considered. Consequently for large
sample sizes, it becomes computationally infeasible or even impossible to fit
the model as the set of pseudo-observations increases nearly quadratically. In
this dissertation, we provide two solutions to fit a probabilistic index model.
The first algorithm consists of splitting the entire data set into unique
partitions. On each of these, we fit the model and then aggregate the
estimates. A second algorithm is a subsampling scheme in which we select $K <<
n$ observations without replacement and after B iterations aggregate the
estimates. In Monte Carlo simulations, we show how the partitioning algorithm
outperforms the latter [...] We illustrate the partitioning algorithm and the
interpretation of the probabilistic index model on a real data set (Przybylski

least squares method. By modelling the probabilistic index, we give an
intuitive and meaningful quantification of the effect of the time adolescents
spend using digital devices such as smartphones on self-reported mental
well-being. We show how moderate usage is associated with an increased
probability of reporting a higher mental well-being compared to random
adolescents who do not use a smartphone. On the other hand, adolescents who
excessively use their smartphone are associated with a higher probability of
reporting a lower mental well-being than randomly chosen peers who do not use a
smartphone.[...]

progressively obtained by combining simpler ones. A recent trend in speech and
speaker recognition consists in discovering these representations starting from
raw audio samples directly. Differently from standard hand-crafted features
such as MFCCs or FBANK, the raw waveform can potentially help neural networks
discover better and more customized representations. The high-dimensional raw
inputs, however, can make training significantly more challenging. This paper
summarizes our recent efforts to develop a neural architecture that efficiently
processes speech from audio waveforms. In particular, we propose SincNet, a
novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that encourages the first layer to
discover meaningful filters by exploiting parametrized sinc functions. In
contrast to standard CNNs, which learn all the elements of each filter, only
low and high cutoff frequencies of band-pass filters are directly learned from
data. This inductive bias offers a very compact way to derive a customized
front-end, that only depends on some parameters with a clear physical meaning.
Our experiments, conducted on both speaker and speech recognition, show that
the proposed architecture converges faster, performs better, and is more
computationally efficient than standard CNNs.

enable robots to learn and complete a manipulation task cooperatively. With
this method, a vision system is involved in both the task demonstration and
reproduction stages. An expert first demonstrates how to use tools to perform a
task, while the tool motion is observed using a vision system. The
demonstrations are then encoded using a statistical model to generate a
reference motion trajectory. Equipped with the same tools and the learned
model, the robot is guided by vision to reproduce the task. The task
performance was evaluated in terms of both accuracy and speed. However, simply
increasing the robot's speed could decrease the reproduction accuracy. To this
end, a dual-rate Kalman filter is employed to compensate for latency between
the robot and vision system. More importantly, the sampling rates of the
reference trajectory and the robot speed are optimised adaptively according to
the learned motion model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by
performing two tasks: a trajectory reproduction task and a bimanual sewing
task. We show that using our vision-based approach, the robots can conduct
effective learning by demonstrations and perform accurate and fast task
reproduction. The proposed approach is generalisable to other manipulation
tasks, where bimanual or multi-robot cooperation is required.

in some detail. Different methods for isochronization of the cyclotron magnetic
field are discussed. The limits of the classical cyclotron are explained.
Typical features of the synchro-cyclotron, such as the beam capture problem,
stable phase motion, and the extraction problem are discussed. The main design
goals for beam injection are explained and special problems related to a
central region with an internal ion source are considered. The principle of a
Penning ion gauge source is addressed. The issue of vertical focusing in the
cyclotron centre is briefly discussed. Several examples of numerical
simulations are given. Different methods of (axial) injection are briefly
outlined. Different solutions for beam extraction are described. These include
the internal target, extraction by stripping, resonant extraction using a
deflector, regenerative extraction, and self-extraction. Different methods of
creating a turn separation are explained. Different types of extraction device,
such as harmonic coils, deflectors, and gradient corrector channels, are
outlined. Some general considerations for cyclotron magnetic design are given
and the use of modern magnetic modelling tools is discussed, with a few
illustrative examples. An approach is chosen where the accent is less on
completeness and rigorousness (because this has already been done) and more on
explaining and illustrating the main principles that are used in medical
cyclotrons. Sometimes a more industrial viewpoint is taken. The use of
complicated formulae is limited.

When pupil tracking suffers from noise like bad illumination, detection

algorithms have become easier to design and evaluate. In this paper, we propose
a robust head mounted pupil detection algorithm which uses a Convolutional

incrementally along with the exploration process. It is a graph structure with
collision-free nodes and edges that are generated within the sensor coverage.
Moreover, each node has a semantic label and the expected information gain at
that location. Based on the concise SRM, we present a novel and effective
decision-making model to determine the next-best-target (NBT) during the
exploration. The model concerns the semantic information, the information gain,
and the path cost to the target location. We use the nodes of SRM to represent
the candidate targets, which enables the target evaluation to be performed
directly on the SRM. With the SRM, both the information gain of a node and the
path cost to the node can be obtained efficiently. Besides, we adopt the

conduct experimental studies in both simulated and real-world environments,

least until Sept. is analyzed elsewhere (Sanchez-Lavega et al., in press ,
2019). Many of the cloud features in 2018 are long-lived and can be identified
in images in 2017, and in some cases, for up to a decade using also Cassini ISS
images. Without considering the polar storms, the most interesting long-lived
cloud systems are: i) A bright spot in the EZ that can be tracked continuously
since 2014 with a zonal velocity of 444 m/s in 2014 and 452 m/s in 2018. This
velocity is different from the zonal winds at the cloud level at its latitude
during the Cassini mission, and is closer to zonal winds obtained at the time
of the Voyager flybys and zonal winds from Cassini VIMS infrared images of the
lower atmosphere. ii) A large Anticyclone Vortex, here AV, that formed after
the GWS of 2010-2011. This vortex has changed significantly in visual contrast,
drift rate and latitude with minor changes in size over the last years. iii) A
system of subpolar vortices present at least since 2011. These vortices follow
drift rates consistent with zonal winds obtained by Cassini. We also present
the positions of the vertices of the North polar hexagon from 2015 to 2018
compared with previous analyses during Cassini (2007-2014), observations with

the different drift rates reinforce the role of the North Polar Spot that was

clinical visits or therapist availability, especially when needed in a timely

patterns between couples at home can provide preliminary information about
potential suicidal behaviors, prior to intervention. In this work, we
investigate whether acoustic, lexical, behavior and turn-taking cues from

risk. We test their effectiveness in real-world noisy conditions by extracting
these cues through an automatic diarization and speech recognition front-end.
Evaluation is performed by classifying 3 degrees of suicidal risk: none,
ideation, attempt. Our automatic system performs significantly better than
chance in all classification scenarios and we find that behavior and

conditioning on factors such as speaker gender and topic of discussion tends to

there is a universal supersymmetric minimum where the scalars end up,

favorable for fast simulations and follow-up applications. While the classical
Kron reduction has been successful in reduced order modeling of power grids
with traditional, hierarchical design, the selection of reference nodes for the
reduced model in a multiscale, distribution and transmission, network becomes
ambiguous. In this work we extend the use of the iterative Kron reduction by
utilizing the electric grid's graph topology for the selection of reference
nodes, consistent with the design features of multiscale networks.
Additionally, we propose further reductions by aggregation of coherent
subnetworks of triangular meshes, based on the graph topology and network
characteristics, in order to preserve currents and build another power-flow
equivalent network.
  Our reductions are achieved through the use of iterative aggregation of
sub-graphs that include general tree structures, lines, and triangles.
Important features of our reduction algorithms include that: (i) the reductions
are, either, equivalent to the Kron reduction, or otherwise produce a
power-flow equivalent network; (ii) due to the former mentioned power-flow
equivalence, the reduced network can model the dynamic of the swing equations
for a lossless, inductive, steady state network; (iii) the algorithms
efficiently utilize hash-tables to store the sequential reduction steps.

turbo-coded comparisons are performed for bit-interleaved coded modulation,
with a concatenated detection and decoding scheme. Simulation results confirm
that multidimensional constellations that satisfy KPIs of a certain channel
scenario outperform others. Moreover, the bit error rate performance of uncoded
systems, and the performance of the coded systems are coupled to their
bit-labeling. The performance of the systems also remarkably depends on the
behavior of the multi-user detector at different signal-to-noise ratio regions.

conveniently investigated by synchrotron-based UV resonance Raman (UVRR)
spectroscopy. The main advantages of this technique for the investigation of
the local structure and intermolecular interactions in imidazolium-based ILs
are presented and discussed. The unique tunability of synchrotron source allows
one to selectively enhance in the Raman spectra the vibrational signals arising
from the imidazolium ring. Such signals showed good sensitivity to the
modifications induced in the local structure of ILs by i) the change of anion
and ii) the progressively longer alkyl chain substitution on the imidazolium
ring. Moreover, some UVRR signals are specifically informative on the effect
induced by addition of water on the strength of cation-anion H-bonds in
IL-water solutions. All of these results corroborate the potentiality of UVRR
to retrieve information on the intermolecular interactions in IL-water
solutions, besides the counterpart obtained by employing on these systems the
spontaneous Raman scattering technique.

more extensive networks of gas-sensitive semiconductor-based (GSS) sensors
deployed at neighbourhood scales in Los Angeles: one of ~20 and one of ~45 GSS
ozone sensors. Of these, ten sensors were co-located with different regulatory
measurement stations, allowing a rigorous test of the accuracy of the
algorithms used for off-site calibration and adjustment of low cost sensors.
The method is based on adjusting the gain and offset of the low-cost sensor to
match the first two moments of the probability distribution of the sensor
result to that of a proxy: a calibrated independent measurement (usually
derived from regulatory monitors) whose probability distribution evaluated over
a time that emphasizes diurnal variations is similar to that at the test
location. The regulatory measurement station physically closest to the low-cost
sensor was a good proxy for most sites. The algorithms developed were
successful in detecting and correcting sensor drift, and in identifying
locations where geographical features resulted in significantly different
patterns of ozone variation due to the relative dominance of different
dispersion, emission and chemical processes. The entire network results show
very large variations in ozone concentration that take place on short time- and
distance scales across the Los-Angeles region. Such patterns were not captured
by the more sparsely distributed stations of the existing regulatory network

technique in science, engineering and military. However, conventional sensing
systems are mostly lack of intelligence, which not only require expensive
hardware and complicated computational algorithms, but also pose important
challenges for advanced in-situ sensing. To address this shortcoming, we
propose the concept of intelligent sensing by designing a programmable
metasurface for data-driven learnable data acquisition, and integrating it into
a data-driven learnable data processing pipeline. This strategy allows to learn
an optimal sensing chain in systematic sense of variational autoencoder, i.e.,
to jointly learn an optimal measurement strategy along with matching data post
processing schemes. A three-port deep artificial neural network (ANN) is
designed to characterize the measurement process, such that an optimal
measurement strategy is adaptive to the subject of interest by controlling the
programmable metasurface for manipulating the EM illuminations. We design and
fabricate a proof-of-principle sensing system in microwave, and demonstrate
experimentally its significance on the high-quality imaging and high-accuracy
object recognition from a remarkably reduced number of measurements. We
faithfully expect that the presented methodology will provide us with a
fundamentally new perspective on the design of intelligent sensing
architectures at various frequencies, and beyond.

enrichments that have been attributed to evaporation of partially or entirely
molten planetesimals. We evaluate the mechanisms of planetesimal evaporation in
the early solar system and the conditions that controlled attendant isotope
fractionations. Energy balance at the surface of a body accreted within ~1 Myr
of CAI formation and heated from within by 26Al decay results in internal
temperatures exceeding the silicate solidus, producing a transient magma ocean
with a thin surface boundary layer of order < 1 meter that would be subject to
foundering. Bodies that are massive enough to form magma oceans by radioisotope
decay (ge 0.1%) can retain hot rock vapor even in the absence of ambient
nebular gas. We find that a steady-state rock vapor forms within minutes to
hours and results from a balance between rates of magma evaporation and
atmospheric escape. Vapor pressure buildup adjacent to the surfaces of the
evaporating magmas would have inevitably led to an approach to equilibrium
isotope partitioning between the vapor phase and the silicate melt. Numerical
simulations of this near-equilibrium evaporation process for a body with a
radius of ~ 700 km yield a steady-state far-field vapor pressure corresponding
to 95% saturation. Approaches to equilibrium isotope fractionation between
vapor and melt should have been the norm during planet formation due to the
formation of steady-state rock vapor atmospheres and/or the presence of
protostellar gas. We model the Si and Mg isotopic composition of bulk Earth and
show that the best fit is for a carbonaceous chondrite-like source material
with about 12% loss of Mg and 15% loss of Si resulting from near-equilibrium
evaporation into the solar protostellar disk of hydrogen gas on timescales of

vertical magnetic field component $B_\text{ver}$ averaged along the umbral
boundary is found to be independent of sunspot size. The authors of that study
conclude that the absolute value of $B_\text{ver}$ at the umbral boundary is
the same for all spots.
  Aims. We investigate the temporal evolution of $B_\text{ver}$ averaged along
the umbral boundary of one long-lived sunspot during its stable phase.
  Methods. We analysed data from the HMI instrument on-board SDO. Contours of
continuum intensity at $I_\text{c}=0.5I_\text{qs}$, whereby $I_\text{qs}$
refers to the average over the quiet sun areas, are used to extract the
magnetic field along the umbral boundary. Projection effects due to different
formation heights of the Fe I 617.3 nm line and continuum are taken into
account. To avoid limb artefacts, the spot is only analysed for heliocentric
angles smaller than $60^{\circ}$.
  Results. During the first disc passage, NOAA AR 11591, $B_\text{ver}$ remains
constant at 1693 G with a root-mean-square deviation of 15 G, whereas the
magnetic field strength varies substantially (mean 2171 G, rms of 48 G) and
shows a long term variation. Compensating for formation height has little
influence on the mean value along each contour, but reduces the variations
along the contour when away from disc centre, yielding a better match between
the contours of $B_\text{ver}=1693$ G and $I_\text{c}=0.5I_\text{qs}$.
  Conclusions. During the disc passage of a stable sunspot, its umbral boundary
can equivalently be defined by using the continuum intensity $I_\text{c}$ or
the vertical magnetic field component $B_\text{ver}$. Contours of fixed
magnetic field strength fail to outline the umbral boundary.

this setting is ill-suited for real-world applications where unseen objects
appear only as a part of a complex scene, warranting both the `recognition' and
`localization' of an unseen category. To address this limitation, we introduce
a new \emph{`Zero-Shot Detection'} (ZSD) problem setting, which aims at
simultaneously recognizing and locating object instances belonging to novel
categories without any training examples. We also propose a new experimental
protocol for ZSD based on the highly challenging ILSVRC dataset, adhering to
practical issues, e.g., the rarity of unseen objects. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first end-to-end deep network for ZSD that jointly
models the interplay between visual and semantic domain information. To
overcome the noise in the automatically derived semantic descriptions, we
utilize the concept of meta-classes to design an original loss function that
achieves synergy between max-margin class separation and semantic space
clustering. Furthermore, we present a baseline approach extended from
recognition to detection setting. Our extensive experiments show significant

language to be memory safe, capturing the intuition that memory safety supports
local reasoning about state. We formalize this principle in two ways. First, we
show how a small memory-safe language validates a noninterference property: a
program can neither affect nor be affected by unreachable parts of the state.
Second, we extend separation logic, a proof system for heap-manipulating
programs, with a memory-safe variant of its frame rule. The new rule is
stronger because it applies even when parts of the program are buggy or
malicious, but also weaker because it demands a stricter form of separation
between parts of the program state. We also consider a number of pragmatically
motivated variations on memory safety and the reasoning principles they
support. As an application of our characterization, we evaluate the security of
a previously proposed dynamic monitor for memory safety of heap-allocated data.

  Computational Aspects",PhD dissertation from Aalborg University,,,,cs.LO cs.FL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Computer systems can be found everywhere: in space, in our homes, in our
cars, in our pockets, and sometimes even in our own bodies. For concerns of
safety, economy, and convenience, it is important that such systems work
correctly. However, it is a notoriously difficult task to ensure that the
software running on computers behaves correctly.
  One approach to ease this task is that of model checking, where a model of
the system is made using some mathematical formalism. Requirements expressed in
a formal language can then be verified against the model in order to give
guarantees that the model satisfies the requirements.
  For many computer systems, time is an important factor. As such, we need our
formalisms and requirement languages to be able to incorporate real time.
  We therefore develop formalisms and algorithms that allow us to compare and
express properties about real-time systems. We first introduce a logical
formalism for reasoning about upper and lower bounds on time, and study the
properties of this formalism, including axiomatisation and algorithms for
checking when a formula is satisfied.
  We then consider the question of when a system is faster than another system.
We show that this is a difficult question which can not be answered in general,
but we identify special cases where this question can be answered. We also show
that under this notion of faster-than, a local increase in speed may lead to a
global decrease in speed, and we take step towards avoiding this.
  Finally, we consider how to compare the real-time behaviour of systems not
just qualitatively, but also quantitatively. Thus, we are interested in knowing
how much one system is faster or slower than another system. This is done by
introducing a distance between systems. We show how to compute this distance
and that it behaves well with respect to certain properties.

  clouds","13 pages, 3 figures",,,,physics.ao-ph,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The ice phase in clouds contributes largely to uncertainties in global
climate models partly due to a lack of atmospheric observations. At moderate
supercooling ice nucleating particles (INP) and ice particles (IP) are present
in small concentrations and a large volume of air is necessary for observation.
Here, we report on initial observations of IP in supercooled fog with a new
setup. We use a 0.3 m wide, vertical curtain of light and a camera pointing
perpendicularly at it to record light scattered by IP formed in radiation fog
near the ground at temperatures between -3 {\deg}C and -9 {\deg}C. Deposition
rates of IP were several times larger than expected from number concentrations
of INP found on $PM_{10}$-filters at a nearby air quality monitoring station.
The discrepancy might be explained by secondary ice formation through the
fragmentation of freezing water droplets, the entrainment of INP from above the
fog layer through settling, the loss or deactivation of INP on
$PM_{10}$-filters prior to analysis, or radiative cooling of INP below the
temperature of the surrounding air. In summary, radiation fog constitutes an
easily accessible form of a supercooled cloud, in which observations can be
made for long enough to quantify the deposition rate of rare IP produced in a
natural environment.

related to uncontrolled fires that can cause potential damages due to the
reduction or even the loss of ecosystems. Our results show that time series of
forest and grassland for unburned and burned areas are characterized by both
periodic and chaotic components. The fire event caused a clear simplification
of vegetation structures as well as of SEL dynamics that is more regular and
predictable after the burning and less chaotic. However grassland evolution
could be more predictable than forest considering the effect of fire
disturbance on successional cycles and stages of the two land-cover types. In
particular, we applied recurrence analysis with sliding temporal windows
three-year length on the original time series. This analysis indicates that
grasslands and forests behaved similarly in correspondence with the burning,
although their phase states slowly diverge after fire. Recurrence is useful to
study the vegetation recovery as it enables mapping landscape transitions
derived from remote sensing. The approach helps stakeholders to draw landscape
interventions and improve management strategies to sustain the delivery of
ecosystem services.

often a limiting factor for training deep neural networks. In contrast to
expensive manual labeling, computer simulations can generate large and fully
labeled data sets with a minimum of manual effort. However, models that are
trained on simulated data usually do not translate well to real scenarios. To
bridge the domain gap between simulated and real laparoscopic images, we
exploit recent advances in unpaired image-to-image translation. We extent an
image-to-image translation method to generate a diverse multitude of
realistically looking synthetic images based on images from a simple
laparoscopy simulation. By incorporating means to ensure that the image content
is preserved during the translation process, we ensure that the labels given
for the simulated images remain valid for their realistically looking
translations. This way, we are able to generate a large, fully labeled
synthetic data set of laparoscopic images with realistic appearance. We show
that this data set can be used to train models for the task of liver
segmentation of laparoscopic images. We achieve average dice scores of up to
0.89 in some patients without manually labeling a single laparoscopic image and
show that using our synthetic data to pre-train models can greatly improve
their performance. The synthetic data set will be made publicly available,

and environmental impact on metropolitan areas worldwide. It is of a great
importance to understand the complex interplay of road networks and traffic
conditions. The authors propose a novel framework to estimate traffic
conditions at the metropolitan scale using GPS traces. Their approach begins
with an initial estimation of network travel times by solving a convex
optimization program based on traffic flow theory. Then, they iteratively
refine the estimated network travel times and vehicle traversed paths. Last,
the authors perform a bilevel optimization process to estimate traffic
conditions on road segments that are not covered by GPS data. The evaluation
and comparison of the authors' approach over two state-of-the-art methods show
up to 96.57% relative improvements. The authors have further conducted field
tests by coupling road networks of San Francisco and Beijing with real-world
GIS data, which involve 128,701 nodes, 148,899 road segments, and over 26
million GPS traces.

the elimination of less fit cells. Over the past decade, the phenomenon of cell
competition has been identified in many physiological and pathological
contexts, driven either by biochemical signaling or by mechanical forces within
the tissue. In both cases, competition has generally been characterized based
on the elimination of loser cells at the population level, but significantly
less attention has been focused on determining how single-cell dynamics and
interactions regulate population-wide changes. In this review, we describe
quantitative strategies and outline the outstanding challenges in understanding
the single cell rules governing tissue-scale competition dynamics. We propose
quantitative metrics to characterize single cell behaviors in competition and
use them to distinguish the types and outcomes of competition. We describe how
such metrics can be measured experimentally using a novel combination of
high-throughput imaging and machine learning algorithms. We outline the
experimental challenges to quantify cell fate dynamics with high-statistical
precision, and describe the utility of computational modeling in testing
hypotheses not easily accessible in experiments. In particular, cell-based
modeling approaches that combine mechanical interaction of cells with
decision-making rules for cell fate choices provide a powerful framework to

heuristics for operationalizing bot-bot conflict. We give thick descriptions of
kinds of events that present as bot-bot reverts, helping distinguish conflict
from non-conflict. We computationally classify these kinds of events through
patterns in edit summaries. By interpreting found/trace data in the
socio-technical contexts in which people give that data meaning, we gain more
from quantitative measurements, drawing deeper understandings about the
governance of algorithmic systems in Wikipedia. We have also released our data

Deleting this wedge of data replaces stripes, scratches, or curtaining, with
more complex streaking and blurring artifacts-known within the tomography
community as missing wedge artifacts. Here, we overcome this problem by
recovering the missing region using total variation minimization, which
leverages image sparsity based reconstruction techniques-colloquially referred
to as compressed sensing-to reliably restore images corrupted by stripe like
features. Our approach removes beam instability, ion mill curtaining,
mechanical scratches, or any stripe features and remains robust at low

is the formation of HO$_2$$^{-}$ and H$_2$O$^{-}$ ions from an electron-induced
chemical reaction between the two dopants. The chemistry leading to these

than O$_2$. The electron resonances for H$_2$ can lead to dissociative electron

proteins, being involved in signaling, catalysis and other fundamental
activities in cells. However, modeling those processes is extremely difficult,
due to the need of efficiently exploring a vast conformational space in order
to seek for the actual transition path for systems whose complexity is already
high in the steady states. Here we report a strategy that simplifies this task
attacking the complexity on several sides. We first apply a minimalist
coarse-grained model to Calmodulin, based on an empirical force field with a
partial structural bias, to explore the transition paths between the apo-closed
state and the Ca-bound open state of the protein. We then select representative
structures along the trajectory based on a structural clustering algorithm and
build a cleaned-up trajectory with them. We finally compare this trajectory
with that produced by the online tool MinActionPath, by minimizing the action
integral using a harmonic network model, and with that obtained by the PROMPT
morphing method, based on an optimal mass transportation-type approach
including physical constraints. The comparison is performed both on the
structural and energetic level, using the coarse-grained and the atomistic
force fields upon reconstruction. Our analysis indicates that this method
returns trajectories capable of exploring intermediate states with physical
meaning, retaining a very low computational cost, which can allow systematic
and extensive exploration of the multi-stable proteins transition pathways.

approaches for processing which are depended on the type of remote sensing
images. The discussed approach in this article, i.e. image fusion, is the use
of natural colors of an optical image for adding color to a grayscale satellite
image which gives us the ability for better observation of the HR image of OLI
sensor of Landsat-8. This process with emphasis on details of fusion technique
has previously been performed; however, we are going to apply the concept of
the interpolation process. In fact, we see many important software tools such
as ENVI and ERDAS as the most famous remote sensing image processing tools have
only classical interpolation techniques (such as bi-linear (BL) and
bi-cubic/cubic convolution (CC)). Therefore, ENVI- and ERDAS-based researches
in image fusion area and even other fusion researches often dont use new and
better interpolators and are mainly concentrated on the fusion algorithms
details for achieving a better quality, so we only focus on the interpolation
impact on fusion quality in Landsat-8 multispectral images. The important
feature of this approach is to use a statistical, adaptive, and edge-guided
interpolation method for improving the color quality in the images in practice.
Numerical simulations show selecting the suitable interpolation techniques in
MRF-based images creates better quality than the classical interpolators.

very complex OCPs. This study demonstrates the utility and application of an
advanced indirect method, the Unified Trigonometrization Method (UTM), to a

parachute deployment altitude for a free-time, fixed-final-velocity entry
trajectory. For entry vehicles, in addition to the bank angle that is
characterized by bang-bang control profiles, there are typically three state
path constraints that have to be considered, namely, the dynamic pressure, heat
rate and g-load. This study shows that the UTM enables simultaneous
regularization of the bang-bang control and satisfaction of the state path
constraints. Two scenarios with and without state path constraints are
considered. The results obtained using the UTM for both of these cases are
found to be in excellent agreement with a direct optimization method.
Furthermore, an interesting feature emerges in the optimal control profile of
the UTM during the initial high-altitude part of the resulting optimal
trajectory for the scenario with state path constraints, which has an appealing
practical implication.

upon the data. The trained network outperformed visual inspection by non-expert
users and a widely used rule-based algorithm, with > 90% test accuracy.
Subsequently, we confirmed that the superior screening performance
significantly improved the tomogram quality. To further confirm the trained
model's performance and generalizability, we evaluated it on unseen biological
cell data obtained with a setup that was not used to generate the training

techniques that provided the saliency map underlying each model inference.

lighting as well as high speed communication, Li-Fi is attracting both
industrial as well as academic researchers. The Li-Fi networking paradigm
offers performance enhancements which can make it an attractive backup option
to be used for networking setup in Internet of things (IOT) and its indoor

with the obvious conditions for the possibility of measurements. The derived
consequences put the measurement problem of quantum mechanics and the
Copenhagen interpretation of the quantum mechanical wavefunction into
perspective. According to our (onto-) logic we find that spacetime can not be

emerges from the isomorphism between the corresponding Lie algebra and the

derive the dimensionality of spacetime, the form of Lorentz transformations and
of the Lorentz force and fundamental laws of physics as the Planck-Einstein

millisecond pulsar (MSP) with a 3.5-ms spin period and a white dwarf (WD)
companion, using data from the Parkes radio telescope. Since we have accurately
measured the polarization properties of this pulsar we have applied the matrix
template matching approach in which the times of arrival are measured using
full polarimetric information. We achieved a weighted root-mean-square timing
residuals (rms) of the timing residuals of 1.23 $\rm \mu s$, 15.5$\%$
improvement compared to the total intensity timing analysis. After studying the
scintillation properties of this pulsar we put constraints on the inclination
angle of the system. Based on these measurements and on $\chi^2$ mapping we put
a 2-$\sigma$ upper limit on the companion mass (0.44 M$_\odot$). Since this
mass limit cannot reveal the nature of the companion we further investigate the
possibility of the companion to be a He WD. Applying the orbital period-mass
relation for such WDs, we conclude that the mass of a He WD companion would be
about 0.26$\pm$0.01 M$_\odot$ which, combined with the measured mass function
and orbital inclination limits, would lead to a light pulsar mass $\leqslant$
1.0 M$_\odot$. This result seems unlikely based on current neutron star

single-photon sources in a layered van der Waals material. These light emitters
appear with a wide range of transition energies ranging over the entire visible

challenging. In addition to their eminent properties as quantum light emitters,
the coupling to phonons is remarkable. Their photoluminescence exhibits
significant side band emission well separated from the zero phonon line (ZPL)
and an asymmetric broadening of the ZPL itself. In this combined theoretical
and experimental study we show that the phonon side bands can be well described
in terms of the coupling to bulk longitudinal optical (LO) phonons. To describe
the ZPL asymmetry we show that in addition to the coupling to longitudinal
acoustic (LA) phonons also the coupling to local mode oscillations of the
defect center with respect to the entire host crystal has to be considered. By
studying the influence of the emitter's wave function dimensions on the phonon
side bands we find reasonable values for size of the wave function and the
deformation potentials. We perform photoluminescence excitation measurements to

biological neural network of the human brain. The overall function of the brain
consists of the emergent processes resulting from the spread of information
through the neural network. The capacity of the brain is therefore related to
the rate at which it can transmit information through the neural network. The
particular transmission model under consideration allows for information to be
transmitted along multiple paths between points of the cortex. The resulting
transmission rates are governed by potential theory. According to this theory,
the brain has preferred and quantized transmission modes that correspond to
eigenfunctions of the classical Steklov eigenvalue problem, with the reciprocal
eigenvalues quantifying the corresponding transmission rates. We take the model
as a basis for testing the hypothesis that the sulcus pattern of the human
brain has evolved to maximize the rate of transmission of information between
points in the cerebral cortex. We show that the introduction of sulci, or cuts,
in an otherwise smooth domain indeed increases the overall transmission rate.
We demonstrate this result by means of numerical experiments concerned with a
spherical domain with a varying number of slits on its surface.

to the human presence or even for the need to reduce costs, it is certain that
many efforts have been made to develop robots with an increasingly high level
of autonomy. They must be capable of locomotion through dynamic environments,
without human operators or assistant systems' help. It is noted, thus, that the
form of perception and modeling of the environment becomes significantly
relevant to navigation. Among the main sensing methods are those based on
vision. Through this, it is possible to create highly-detailed models about the
environment, since many characteristics can be measured, such as texture,
color, and illumination. However, the most accurate vision-based navigation
techniques are computationally expensive to run on low-cost mobile platforms.
Therefore, the goal of this work was to develop a low-cost robot, controlled by
a Raspberry Pi, whose navigation system is based on vision. For this purpose,
the strategy used consisted in identifying obstacles via optical flow pattern
recognition. Through this signal, it is possible to infer the relative
displacement between the robot and other elements in the environment. Its
estimation was done using the Lucas-Kanade algorithm, which can be executed by
the Raspberry Pi without harming its performance. Finally, an SVM based
classifier was used to identify patterns of this signal associated with
obstacles movement. The developed system was evaluated considering its
execution over an optical flow pattern dataset extracted from a real navigation
environment. In the end, it was verified that the processing frequency of the
system was superior to the others. Furthermore, its accuracy and acquisition
cost were, respectively, higher and lower than most of the cited works.

  Necessary and Sufficient Conditions",,,,,cs.PF,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  In this paper, we consider a load balancing system under a general pull-based
policy. In particular, each arrival is randomly dispatched to one of the
servers whose queue lengths are below a threshold, if there are any; otherwise,
this arrival is randomly dispatched to one of the entire set of servers. We are
interested in the fundamental relationship between the threshold and the delay
performance of the system in heavy traffic. To this end, we first establish the
following necessary condition to guarantee heavy-traffic delay optimality: the
threshold will grow to infinity as the exogenous arrival rate approaches the
boundary of the capacity region (i.e., the load intensity approaches one) but
the growth rate should be slower than a polynomial function of the mean number
of tasks in the system. As a special case of this result, we directly show that
the delay performance of the popular pull-based policy Join-Idle-Queue (JIQ)
lies strictly between that of any heavy-traffic delay optimal policy and that
of random routing. We further show that a sufficient condition for
heavy-traffic delay optimality is that the threshold grows logarithmically with
the mean number of tasks in the system. This result directly resolves a
generalized version of the conjecture by Kelly and Laws.

Lykouris and Vassilvitskii, the goal is to solve the caching problem with an
online algorithm that has access to next-arrival predictions: when each input
element arrives, the algorithm is given a prediction of the next time when the
element will reappear. The traditional model for online caching suffers from an
$\Omega(\log k)$ competitive ratio lower bound (on a cache of size $k$). In
contrast, the augmented model admits algorithms which beat this lower bound
when the predictions have low error, and asymptotically match the lower bound
when the predictions have high error, even if the algorithms are oblivious to
the prediction error. In particular, Lykouris and Vassilvitskii showed that
there is a prediction-augmented caching algorithm with a competitive ratio of
$O(1+\min(\sqrt{\eta/OPT}, \log k))$ when the overall $\ell_1$ prediction error
is bounded by $\eta$, and $OPT$ is the cost of the optimal offline algorithm.
  The dependence on $k$ in the competitive ratio is optimal, but the dependence
on $\eta/OPT$ may be far from optimal. In this work, we make progress towards
closing this gap. Our contributions are twofold. First, we provide an improved
algorithm with a competitive ratio of $O(1 + \min((\eta/OPT)/k, 1) \log k)$.
Second, we provide a lower bound of $\Omega(\log \min((\eta/OPT)/(k \log k),
k))$.

Here, the emphasis is on accurately approximating the shape of such
\emph{one-dimensional} functions. Approximating this shape when the function is
evaluated on a set of grid points instead is relatively straightforward.
However, the number of grid points needed increases exponentially with $s$. LDS
are known to be increasingly more efficient at integrating $s$-dimensional
functions compared to grids, as $s$ increases. Yet, a method to approximate the
shape of a one-dimensional function when the function is evaluated using an

method for this problem. This method is based on an $s$-dimensional integration
rule together with fitting a polynomial smoothing function. We state and prove
results showing conditions under which this polynomial smoothing function will
converge to the true one-dimensional function. We also demonstrate the
computational efficiency of the new approach compared to a grid based approach.

classical result of Tutte(1954) is the polynomial time algorithm to check
whether a given graph has a specified f-factor. However, checking for the

NP-complete even when we restrict f(v) to be at least n^e for each vertex v and

with pointers from declarative specifications expressed in Separation Logic.
Our synthesis algorithm takes as input a pair of assertions---a pre- and a
postcondition---which describe two states of the symbolic heap, and derives a
program that transforms one state into the other, guided by the shape of the
heap. The program synthesis algorithm rests on the novel framework of Synthetic
Separation Logic (SSL), which generalises the classical notion of heap
entailment $\mathcal{P} \vdash \mathcal{Q}$ to incorporate a possibility of
transforming a heap satisfying an assertion $\mathcal{P}$ into a heap
satisfying an assertion $\mathcal{Q}$. A synthesized program represents a proof
term for a transforming entailment statement $\mathcal{P} \leadsto
\mathcal{Q}$, and the synthesis procedure corresponds to a proof search. The
derived programs are, thus, correct by construction, in the sense that they
satisfy the ascribed pre/postconditions, and are accompanied by complete proof
derivations, which can be checked independently.
  We have implemented a proof search engine for SSL in a form the program
synthesizer called SuSLik. For efficiency, the engine exploits properties of
SSL rules, such as invertibility and commutativity of rule applications on
separate heaps, to prune the space of derivations it has to consider. We
explain and showcase the use of SSL on characteristic examples, describe the
design of SuSLik, and report on our experience of using it to synthesize a
series of benchmark programs manipulating heap-based linked data structures.

alternative to global rollback, for fault tolerant MPI applications. Until now,
message logging MPI implementations have incurred the overheads of a redesign

across various kernels. Successful research efforts for message logging
implementations do exist, but not a single one of them can be easily deployed
today by more than a few experts. In contrast, in this work we build efficient
message logging capabilities on top of an MPI library with no message logging
capabilities; we do so for two different HPC kernels, one with a global
exchange pattern (CG), and one with a neighbourhood exchange pattern (LULESH).
While our library of choice ULFM detects failure and recovers MPI
communicators, we build on that to then restore the intra- and inter-process
data consistency of both applications. This task turns out to be challenging,
and we present the methodology for doing so in this work. In the end, we
achieve message logging capabilities for each kernel, without the need for an
actual message logging runtime underneath. On the performance side, we match
state-of-the-art solutions and (a) eliminate event logging and the event logger
component altogether, and (b) design a hybrid protocol, which gracefully shifts
between global and local rollback, depending on the available payload logging
memory. Such a hybrid protocol between local and global rollback has not been
previously proposed to our knowledge. Our extensions span a few hundred lines

the social-engineering campaigns of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks.
Behavioral decision theory fares better, but still falls short of capturing
social-engineering attack vectors, which operate through emotions and
peripheral-route persuasion. We introduce a generalized decision theory, under
which any decision will be made according to one of multiple coexisting choice
criteria. We denote the set of possible choice criteria by $\mathcal{C}$. Thus
the proposed model reduces to conventional Expected Utility theory when
$|\,\mathcal{C}_{\text{EU}}|=1$, whilst Dual-Process (thinking fast vs.
thinking slow) decision making corresponds to a model with
$|\,\mathcal{C}_{\text{DP}}|=2$. We consider a more general case with
$|\,\mathcal{C}|\geq 2$, which necessitates careful consideration of _how_, for
a particular choice-task instance, one criterion comes to prevail over others.
We operationalize this with a probability distribution that is conditional upon
traits of the decision maker as well as upon the context and the framing of
choice options. Whereas existing Signal Detection Theory (SDT) models of
phishing detection commingle the different peripheral-route persuasion
pathways, in the present descriptive generalization the different pathways are
explicitly identified and represented. A number of implications follow
immediately from this formulation, ranging from the conditional nature of
security-breach risk to delineation of the prerequisites for valid tests of
security training. Moreover, the model explains the `stepping-stone'
penetration pattern of APT attacks, which has confounded modeling approaches

setting over-parameterised neural networks are not amenable for learning from
few samples as they can quickly over-fit. In addition, these approaches do not
have such a strong generalisation ability to identify a new category, where the
data of each category is too limited and significant variations exist in the
expression within the same semantic category. We embrace these challenges and
formulate the problem as a low-shot learning, where once the base classifier is
deployed, it must rapidly adapt to recognise novel classes using a few samples.
In this paper, we revisit and compare existing few-shot learning methods for
the low-shot facial expression recognition in terms of their generalisation
ability via episode-training. In particular, we extend our analysis on the
cross-domain generalisation, where training and test tasks are not drawn from
the same distribution. We demonstrate the efficacy of low-shot learning methods
through extensive experiments.

has maximum degree at most $d$, and has ""clustering"" $c$ if each monochromatic
component has at most $c$ vertices. This paper studies defective and clustered
list-colourings for graphs with given maximum average degree. We prove that
every graph with maximum average degree less than $\frac{2d+2}{d+2} k$ is
$k$-choosable with defect $d$. This improves upon a similar result by Havet and
Sereni [J. Graph Theory, 2006]. For clustered choosability of graphs with
maximum average degree $m$, no $(1-\epsilon)m$ bound on the number of colours
was previously known. The above result with $d=1$ solves this problem. It
implies that every graph with maximum average degree $m$ is
$\lfloor{\frac{3}{4}m+1}\rfloor$-choosable with clustering 2. This extends a
result of Kopreski and Yu [Discrete Math., 2017] to the setting of
choosability. We then prove two results about clustered choosability that
explore the trade-off between the number of colours and the clustering. In
particular, we prove that every graph with maximum average degree $m$ is
$\lfloor{\frac{7}{10}m+1}\rfloor$-choosable with clustering $9$, and is
$\lfloor{\frac{2}{3}m+1}\rfloor$-choosable with clustering $O(m)$. As an
example, the later result implies that every biplanar graph is 8-choosable with
bounded clustering. This is the best known result for the clustered version of
the earth-moon problem. The results extend to the setting where we only
consider the maximum average degree of subgraphs with at least some number of
vertices. Several applications are presented.

important concern in today's Western democracies. Members of Parliament (MPs)

being on digital platforms such as Twitter. In recent years, nearly all (579

comparable to a sizable fraction of the country's population. This paper seeks
to shed light on this phenomenon by examining the volume and nature of the
interaction between MPs and citizens. We find that although there is an
information overload on MPs, attention on individual MPs is focused during
small time windows when something topical may be happening relating to them.
MPs manage their interaction strategically, replying selectively to UK-based
citizens and thereby serving in their role as elected representatives, and
using retweets to spread their party's message. Most promisingly, we find that
Twitter opens up new avenues with substantial volumes of cross-party
interaction, between MPs of one party and citizens who support (follow) MPs of
other parties.

and the convolutional filters in the first layer of the CNN are then
regularized by employing a group Lasso algorithm to zero out the redundant
bands during the training of the network. Contrary to other methods which
usually select the useful bands manually or in a greedy fashion, our method
selects the optimal spectral bands automatically to achieve the best face

case, 28% power savings are obtained considering futuristic network components

power savings comparable to the MILP results. Furthermore, we study how the
change in network topology affects the savings produced by network coding. The
results show that the savings are proportional to the average hop count of the

process of optimizing the agent's reward while avoiding dangerous behaviors
given by a demonstrator. In this work we develop a framework of avoidance
learning by defining a suitable objective function for these problems which
involves the \emph{distance} of state occupancy distributions of the expert and
demonstrator policies. We use density estimates for state occupancy measures
and use the aforementioned distance as the reward bonus for avoiding the

improve on existing simulation schemes by incorporating Bayesian field

on a notion of prior belief. Here, we analytically prove that a restricted
subset of simulation schemes in IFD are consistent, and thus deliver valid
predictions in the limit of high resolutions. This has not previously been done
for any IFD schemes. This restricted subset is roughly analogous to traditional
fixed-grid numerical PDE solvers, given the additional restriction of
translational symmetry. Furthermore, given an arbitrary IFD scheme modelling a
PDE, it is a-priori not obvious to what order the scheme is accurate in space
and time. For this subset of models, we also derive an easy rule-of-thumb for
determining the order of accuracy of the simulation. As with all analytic
consistency analysis, an analysis for nontrivial systems is intractable, thus
these results are intended as a general indicator of the validity of the
approach, and it is hoped that the results will generalize.

  Charlotte, NC, USA. June, 2019",,,,cs.LG cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The generative capabilities of deep learning neural networks (DNNs) have been
attracting increasing attention for both the remarkable artifacts they produce,
but also because of the vast conceptual difference between how they are
programmed and what they do. DNNs are 'black boxes' where high-level behavior
is not explicitly programmed, but emerges from the complex interactions of
thousands or millions of simple computational elements. Their behavior is often
described in anthropomorphic terms that can be misleading, seem magical, or
stoke fears of an imminent singularity in which machines become 'more' than
human. In this paper, we examine 5 distinct behavioral characteristics
associated with creativity, and provide an example of a mechanisms from
generative deep learning architectures that give rise to each these
characteristics. All 5 emerge from machinery built for purposes other than the
creative characteristics they exhibit, mostly classification. These mechanisms
of creative generative capabilities thus demonstrate a deep kinship to
computational perceptual processes. By understanding how these different
behaviors arise, we hope to on one hand take the magic out of anthropomorphic
descriptions, but on the other, to build a deeper appreciation of machinic
forms of creativity on their own terms that will allow us to nurture their
further development.

saturation (sO2) in vivo. However, making accurate sO2 measurements without
knowledge of tissue- and instrumentation-related correction factors is
extremely challenging. We have developed a low-cost flow phantom system to
facilitate validation of photoacoustic tomography systems. The phantom is
composed of a flow circuit, which is partially embedded within a tissue
mimicking phantom, with independent sensors providing online monitoring of the
optical absorption spectrum and partial pressure of oxygen in the tube. We
first establish the flow phantom using two small molecule dyes that are
frequently used for photoacoustic imaging: methylene blue (MB) and indocyanine
green (ICG). We then demonstrate the potential of the phantom for evaluating
sO2 using chemical oxygenation and deoxygenation of blood in the phantom. Using
this dynamic assessment of the photoacoustic sO2 measurement in phantoms in
relation to a ground truth, we explore the influence of multispectral
processing and spectral coloring on accurate assessment of sO2. Future studies
could exploit this low-cost dynamic flow phantom to validate fluence correction
algorithms and explore additional blood parameters such as pH, and also
absorptive and other properties of different fluids.

  Co-location: A Mixture of Experts Approach",ACM/IFIP/USENIX Middleware 2017,,,,cs.DC,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Data analytic applications built upon big data processing frameworks such as
Apache Spark are an important class of applications. Many of these applications
are not latency-sensitive and thus can run as batch jobs in data centers. By
running multiple applications on a computing host, task co-location can
significantly improve the server utilization and system throughput. However,
effective task co-location is a non-trivial task, as it requires an
understanding of the computing resource requirement of the co-running
applications, in order to determine what tasks, and how many of them, can be
co-located.
  In this paper, we present a mixture-of-experts approach to model the memory
behavior of Spark applications. We achieve this by learning, off-line, a range
of specialized memory models on a range of typical applications; we then
determine at runtime which of the memory models, or experts, best describes the
memory behavior of the target application. We show that by accurately
estimating the resource level that is needed, a co-location scheme can
effectively determine how many applications can be co-located on the same host
to improve the system throughput, by taking into consideration the memory and
CPU requirements of co-running application tasks. Our technique is applied to a
set of representative data analytic applications built upon the Apache Spark
framework. We evaluated our approach for system throughput and average
normalized turnaround time on a multi-core cluster. Our approach achieves over
83.9% of the performance delivered using an ideal memory predictor. We obtain,
on average, 8.69x improvement on system throughput and a 49% reduction on
turnaround time over executing application tasks in isolation, which translates
to a 1.28x and 1.68x improvement over a state-of-the-art co-location scheme for
system throughput and turnaround time respectively.

chemical kinetics in order to capture limit phenomena such as ignition and
extinction as well as predict pollutant formation. However, the chemical
kinetic models for hydrocarbon fuels of practical interest typically have large
numbers of species and reactions and exhibit high levels of mathematical
stiffness in the governing differential equations, particularly for larger fuel
molecules. In order to integrate the stiff equations governing chemical
kinetics, generally reactive-flow simulations rely on implicit algorithms that
require frequent Jacobian matrix evaluations. Some in situ and a posteriori
computational diagnostics methods also require accurate Jacobian matrices,
including computational singular perturbation and chemical explosive mode
analysis. Typically, finite differences numerically approximate these, but for
larger chemical kinetic models this poses significant computational demands
since the number of chemical source term evaluations scales with the square of
species count. Furthermore, existing analytical Jacobian tools do not optimize
evaluations or support emerging SIMD processors such as GPUs. Here we introduce
pyJac, a Python-based open-source program that generates analytical Jacobian
matrices for use in chemical kinetics modeling and analysis. As a
demonstration, we first establish the correctness of the Jacobian matrices for
kinetic models of hydrogen, methane, ethylene, and isopentanol oxidation, then
demonstrate the performance achievable on CPUs and GPUs using pyJac via matrix

AIA method has been implemented in the BCAM-modified GROMACS software package.
Numerical tests in molecular dynamics and hybrid Monte Carlo simulations of
constrained and unconstrained physical systems show that the method
successfully realises the fail-safe strategy. In all experiments, and for each
of the criteria employed, the AIA is at least as good as, and often
significantly outperforms the standard Verlet scheme, as well as fixed

efficiency found in simulations using the AIA is up to 5 times better than the

and tracking system for video surveillance using neural networks which can be
used in dynamic environments. The proposed system consists of two phases:
multi-view pedestrian detection and tracking. First, pedestrian detection
utilizes background subtraction to segment the foreground blob. An adaptive
background subtraction method where each of the pixel of input image models as
a mixture of Gaussians and uses an on-line approximation to update the model
applies to extract the foreground region. The Gaussian distributions are then
evaluated to determine which are most likely to result from a background
process. This method produces a steady, real-time tracker in outdoor
environment that consistently deals with changes of lighting condition, and
long-term scene change. Second, the Tracking is performed at two phases:
pedestrian classification and tracking the individual subject. A sliding window
is applied on foreground binary image to select an input window which is used
for selecting the input image patches from actually input frame. The neural
networks is used for classification with PHOG features. Finally, a Kalman
filter is applied to calculate the subsequent step for tracking that aims at
finding the exact position of pedestrians in an input image. The experimental
result shows that the proposed approach yields promising performance on
multi-view pedestrian detection and tracking on different benchmark datasets.

approaches fail in differentiating between benign and obfuscated malicious

infrastructures. However, the amount of diagnostic imaging procedures has
continuously increased over the last decades, imposing several challenges
associated with the storage volume, data redundancy and availability. Cloud
platforms are focused on delivering hardware and software services over the
Internet, becoming an appealing solution for repository outsourcing. Although
this option may bring financial and technological benefits, it also presents
new challenges. In medical imaging scenarios, communication latency is a
critical issue that still hinders the adoption of this paradigm. This paper
proposes an intelligent Cloud storage gateway that optimizes data access times.
This is achieved through a new cache architecture that combines static rules
and pattern recognition for eviction and prefetching. The evaluation results,
obtained through simulations over a real-world dataset, show that cache hit
ratios can reach around 80%, leading reductions of image retrieval times by
over 60%. The combined use of eviction and prefetching policies pro- posed can
significantly reduce communication latency, even when using a small cache in
comparison to the total size of the repository. Apart from the performance

heteroscedastic noise innovations (GLMH) for analyzing functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The model is analyzed from a Bayesian
perspective and has the benefit of automatically down-weighting time points
close to motion spikes in a data-driven manner. We develop a highly efficient
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that allows for Bayesian variable
selection among the regressors to model both the mean (i.e., the design matrix)
and variance. This makes it possible to include a broad range of explanatory
variables in both the mean and variance (e.g., time trends, activation stimuli,
head motion parameters and their temporal derivatives), and to compute the
posterior probability of inclusion from the MCMC output. Variable selection is
also applied to the lags in the autoregressive noise process, making it
possible to infer the lag order from the data simultaneously with all other
model parameters. We use both simulated data and real fMRI data from OpenfMRI
to illustrate the importance of proper modeling of heteroscedasticity in fMRI
data analysis. Our results show that the GLMH tends to detect more brain
activity, compared to its homoscedastic counterpart, by allowing the variance
to change over time depending on the degree of head motion.

and transform them from merely being a blind tube that conveys data, into a
cognitive, conscious, and self-optimizing entity that can intelligently adapt
according to the needs of its users. This, in fact, can be regarded as one of
the highest forthcoming priorities of future networks. In this paper, we
propose a system for Out-Patient (OP) centric Long Term Evolution-Advanced
(LTE-A) network optimization. Big data harvested from the OPs' medical records,
along with current readings from their body sensors are processed and analyzed
to predict the likelihood of a life-threatening medical condition, for
instance, an imminent stroke. This prediction is used to ensure that the OP is
assigned an optimal LTE-A Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) to transmit their
critical data to their healthcare provider with minimal delay. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first time big data analytics are utilized to
optimize a cellular network in an OP-conscious manner. The PRBs assignment is
optimized using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and a real-time
heuristic. Two approaches are proposed, the Weighted Sum Rate Maximization
(WSRMax) approach and the Proportional Fairness (PF) approach. The approaches
increased the OPs' average SINR by 26.6% and 40.5%, respectively. The WSRMax
approach increased the system's total SINR to a level higher than that of the
PF approach, however, the PF approach reported higher SINRs for the OPs, better
fairness and a lower margin of error.

powered by superconducting accelerator technology enables the measurement of
significantly more experimental data per day than was previously possible. The
European XFEL will soon provide 27,000 pulses per second, more than two orders
of magnitude more than any other XFEL. The increased pulse rate is a key
enabling factor for single-particle X-ray diffractive imaging, which relies on
averaging the weak diffraction signal from single biological particles. Taking
full advantage of this new capability requires that all experimental steps,
from sample preparation and delivery to the acquisition of diffraction
patterns, are compatible with the increased pulse repetition rate. Here, we
show that single-particle imaging can be performed using X-ray pulses at
megahertz repetition rates. The obtained results pave the way towards
exploiting high repetition-rate X-ray free-electron lasers for single-particle
imaging at their full repetition rate.

responsible for the application performance bottleneck. While the sparse matrix
representation has a significant impact on the resulting application
performance, choosing the right representation typically relies on expert

study on the impact of sparse matrix representations on two emerging many-core

FT-2000Plus (FTP). Our large-scale experiments involved over 9,500 distinct
profiling runs performed on 956 sparse datasets and five mainstream SpMV
representations. We show that the best sparse matrix representation depends on
the underlying architecture and the program input. To help developers to choose
the optimal matrix representation, we employ machine learning to develop a
predictive model. Our model is first trained offline using a set of training
examples. The learned model can be used to predict the best matrix
representation for any unseen input for a given architecture. We show that our

and the ""dialectical"" structure of GAN frameworks. As a demonstration, a
typical example will be shown where a low-resolution SAR image (e.g., a

high-resolution SAR image (e.g., a TerraSAR-X image). Three traditional
algorithms are compared, and a new algorithm is proposed based on a network

individual advertising effect in causal inference with multiple treatments and
bound the expected estimation error with learnable factual loss and distance of
treatment-specific context distributions. Accordingly, a representation and
hypothesis network is used to minimize the loss bound. We apply the learned
causal effect in the online bidding engine of an industry-level sponsored
search system. Online experiments show that the causal inference based bidding
outperforms the existing online bidding algorithm.

to as high quality images with little intervention by the human operator. In
clinical practice, the improved image quality should translate into more robust

enabled by the constantly improving hardware performance with low cost. We will
briefly review possible computation methods in larger clinical systems.

to detect obstacles in the flight path in order to avoid collisions. Since a
large number of consumer UAVs suffer from tight weight and power constraints,
our work focuses on obstacle avoidance based on a lightweight stereo camera
setup. We use disparity maps, which are computed from the camera images, to
locate obstacles and to automatically steer the UAV around them. For disparity
map computation we optimize the well-known semi-global matching (SGM) approach
for the deployment on an embedded FPGA. The disparity maps are then converted
into simpler representations, the so called U-/V-Maps, which are used for
obstacle detection. Obstacle avoidance is based on a reactive approach which
finds the shortest path around the obstacles as soon as they have a critical
distance to the UAV. One of the fundamental goals of our work was the reduction
of development costs by closing the gap between application development and
hardware optimization. Hence, we aimed at using high-level synthesis (HLS) for
porting our algorithms, which are written in C/C++, to the embedded FPGA. We
evaluated our implementation of the disparity estimation on the KITTI Stereo

  Research Record, Journal of Transportation Research Board 2018",,,TRR Paper Number: 18-03501,cs.CR,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Active Traffic Management (ATM) systems have been introduced by
transportation agencies to manage recurrent and non-recurrent congestion. ATM
systems rely on the interconnectivity of components made possible by wired
and/or wireless networks. Unfortunately, this connectivity that supports ATM
systems also provides potential system access points that results in
vulnerability to cyberattacks. This is becoming more pronounced as ATM systems
begin to integrate internet of things (IoT) devices. Hence, there is a need to
rigorously evaluate ATM systems for cyberattack vulnerabilities, and explore
design concepts that provide stability and graceful degradation in the face of
cyberattacks. In this research, a prototype ATM system along with a real-time
cyberattack monitoring system were developed for a 1.5-mile section of I-66 in
Northern Virginia. The monitoring system detects deviation from expected
operation of an ATM system by comparing lane control states generated by the
ATM system with lane control states deemed most likely by the monitoring
system. In case of any deviation between two sets of states, the monitoring
system displays the lane control states generated by the back-up data source.
In a simulation experiment, the prototype ATM system and cyberattack monitoring
system were subject to emulated cyberattacks. The evaluation results showed
that when subject to cyberattack, the mean speed reduced by 15% compared to the
case with the ATM system and was similar to the baseline case. This illustrates
that the effectiveness of the ATM system was negated by cyberattacks. The
monitoring system however, allowed the ATM system to revert to an expected safe
state and reduced the negative impact of cyberattacks. These results illustrate
the need to revisit ATM system design concepts as a means to protect against
cyberattacks in addition to traditional system intrusion prevention approaches.

a trade-off between exploitation of past discoveries and further exploration.
This extends to information foraging, where a knowledge-seeker shifts between
reading in depth and studying new domains. To study this decision-making
process, we examine the reading choices made by one of the most celebrated
scientists of the modern era: Charles Darwin. From the full-text of books
listed in his chronologically-organized reading journals, we generate topic
models to quantify his local (text-to-text) and global (text-to-past) reading
decisions using Kullback-Liebler Divergence, a cognitively-validated,
information-theoretic measure of relative surprise. Rather than a pattern of
surprise-minimization, corresponding to a pure exploitation strategy, Darwin's
behavior shifts from early exploitation to later exploration, seeking unusually
high levels of cognitive surprise relative to previous eras. These shifts,
detected by an unsupervised Bayesian model, correlate with major intellectual
epochs of his career as identified both by qualitative scholarship and Darwin's
own self-commentary. Our methods allow us to compare his consumption of texts
with their publication order. We find Darwin's consumption more exploratory
than the culture's production, suggesting that underneath gradual societal
changes are the explorations of individual synthesis and discovery. Our
quantitative methods advance the study of cognitive search through a framework
for testing interactions between individual and collective behavior and between
short- and long-term consumption choices. This novel application of topic
modeling to characterize individual reading complements widespread studies of

  High Dimensional Data",,,,,cs.LG stat.ML,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  This paper presents a new fuzzy k-means algorithm for the clustering of high
dimensional data in various subspaces. Since, In the case of high dimensional
data, some features might be irrelevant and relevant but may have different
significance in the clustering. For a better clustering, it is crucial to
incorporate the contribution of these features in the clustering process. To
combine these features, in this paper, we have proposed a new fuzzy k-means
clustering algorithm in which the objective function of the fuzzy k-means is
modified using two different entropy term. The first entropy term helps to
minimize the within-cluster dispersion and maximize the negative entropy to
determine clusters to contribute to the association of data points. The second
entropy term helps to control the weight of the features because different
features have different contributing weights in the clustering process for
obtaining the better partition of the data. The efficacy of the proposed method
is presented in terms of various clustering measures on multiple datasets and
compared with various state-of-the-art methods.

either implicitly or explicitly mapping the environment, ego-motion can be
determined and a path of actions can be planned. The process of mapping and
navigation are delicately intertwined; therefore, improving one can often lead
to an improvement of the other. Both processes are sensitive to the interior
orientation parameters of the camera system and mathematically modelling these
systematic errors can often improve the precision and accuracy of the overall
solution. This paper presents an automatic camera calibration method suitable
for any lens, without having prior knowledge about the sensor. Statistical
inference is performed to map the environment and localize the camera
simultaneously. K-nearest neighbour regression is used to model the geometric
distortions of the images. A normal-angle lens Nikon camera and wide-angle lens
GoPro camera were calibrated using the proposed method, as well as the
conventional bundle adjustment with self-calibration method (for comparison).
Results showed that the mapping error was reduced from an average of 14.9 mm to
1.2 mm (i.e. a 92% improvement) and 66.6 mm to 1.5 mm (i.e. a 98% improvement)
using the proposed method for the Nikon and GoPro cameras, respectively. In
contrast, the conventional approach achieved an average 3D error of 0.9 mm
(i.e. 94% improvement) and 3.3 mm (i.e. 95% improvement) for the Nikon and
GoPro cameras, respectively. Thus, the proposed method performs well
irrespective of the lens/sensor used: it yields results that are comparable to
the conventional approach for normal-angle lens cameras, and it has the
additional benefit of improving calibration results for wide-angle lens
cameras.

learning a direct map from causes to effects. Experiments on synthetic data

target attribute of a sensitive dataset which can only be queried through a
specific class of real-world privacy-preserving algorithms which we call
bounded perturbation algorithms. A defining property of such an algorithm is
that it perturbs answers to the queries by adding zero-mean noise distributed
within a bounded (possibly undisclosed) range. Other key properties of the
algorithm include only allowing restricted queries (enforced via an online
interface), suppressing answers to queries which are only satisfied by a small
group of individuals (e.g., by returning a zero as an answer), and adding the
same perturbation to two queries which are satisfied by the same set of
individuals (to thwart differencing or averaging attacks). A real-world example
of such an algorithm is the one deployed by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics' (ABS) online tool called TableBuilder, which allows users to create
tables, graphs and maps of Australian census data [30]. We assume an attacker
(say, a curious analyst) who is given oracle access to the algorithm via an
interface. We describe two attacks on the algorithm. Both attacks are based on
carefully constructing (different) queries that evaluate to the same answer.
The first attack finds the hidden perturbation parameter $r$ (if it is assumed
not to be public knowledge). The second attack removes the noise to obtain the
original answer of some (counting) query of choice. We also show how to use
this attack to find the number of individuals in the dataset with a target
attribute value $a$ of any attribute $A$, and then for all attribute values
$a_i \in A$. Our attacks are a practical illustration of the (informal)
fundamental law of information recovery which states that ``overly accurate
estimates of too many statistics completely destroys privacy'' [9, 15].

  Meng",Meta-Weight-Net: Learning an Explicit Mapping For Sample Weighting,NeurIPS 2019,,,,cs.LG stat.ML,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Current deep neural networks (DNNs) can easily overfit to biased training
data with corrupted labels or class imbalance. Sample re-weighting strategy is
commonly used to alleviate this issue by designing a weighting function mapping
from training loss to sample weight, and then iterating between weight
recalculating and classifier updating. Current approaches, however, need
manually pre-specify the weighting function as well as its additional
hyper-parameters. It makes them fairly hard to be generally applied in practice
due to the significant variation of proper weighting schemes relying on the
investigated problem and training data. To address this issue, we propose a
method capable of adaptively learning an explicit weighting function directly
from data. The weighting function is an MLP with one hidden layer, constituting
a universal approximator to almost any continuous functions, making the method
able to fit a wide range of weighting functions including those assumed in
conventional research. Guided by a small amount of unbiased meta-data, the
parameters of the weighting function can be finely updated simultaneously with
the learning process of the classifiers. Synthetic and real experiments
substantiate the capability of our method for achieving proper weighting
functions in class imbalance and noisy label cases, fully complying with the
common settings in traditional methods, and more complicated scenarios beyond
conventional cases. This naturally leads to its better accuracy than other
state-of-the-art methods.

$S_0$ and $\eta$ first in the bursting limit (where the ratio $\gamma$ of the

be done almost entirely analytically, and the results are in good agreement
with simulations. For finite $\gamma$ numerical calculations are generally
required. However, $S_0$ can be calculated analytically to first order in
$1/\gamma$, and the result agrees well with the full numerical calculation for
all $\gamma > 1$. Employing a method used previously on other problems, we find
we can account qualitatively for the way the prefactor $\eta$ varies with

of scientific research and industrial practice. Often the underlying mechanism
is highly complex, involving hidden evolving nonlinear dynamics and noise
contamination. When representative physical models and large labeled data sets
are unavailable, as is the case with most real-world applications,
model-dependent Bayesian approaches would yield misleading results, and most
supervised learning machines would also fail to reliably resolve the
intricately evolving systems. Here, we propose an unsupervised machine-learning
approach that operates in a well-constructed function space, whereby the
evolving nonlinear dynamics are captured through a linear functional

on the time-feature embedding and the ensuing reconstruction of a phase-space

of critical global signatures from the whole trajectory. This dramatically
improves over commonly used static local features, which are vulnerable to

  Self-supervised Tasks",,,,,cs.LG cs.SD eess.AS stat.ML,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Learning good representations without supervision is still an open issue in
machine learning, and is particularly challenging for speech signals, which are
often characterized by long sequences with a complex hierarchical structure.
Some recent works, however, have shown that it is possible to derive useful
speech representations by employing a self-supervised encoder-discriminator
approach. This paper proposes an improved self-supervised method, where a
single neural encoder is followed by multiple workers that jointly solve
different self-supervised tasks. The needed consensus across different tasks
naturally imposes meaningful constraints to the encoder, contributing to
discover general representations and to minimize the risk of learning
superficial ones. Experiments show that the proposed approach can learn
transferable, robust, and problem-agnostic features that carry on relevant
information from the speech signal, such as speaker identity, phonemes, and
even higher-level features such as emotional cues. In addition, a number of
design choices make the encoder easily exportable, facilitating its direct
usage or adaptation to different problems.

the Solar System's building blocks, is still a highly debated subject.
Complementary superchrondritic compositions of chondrite matrices and
subchondritic chondrules may point to formation of these components within the
same reservoir or, alternatively, to mobilization of elements during secondary
alteration on chondrite parent bodies. Zinc isotope fractionation through
evaporation during chondrule formation may play an important role in
identifying complementary relationships between chondrules and matrix and is
additionally a mobile element during hydrothermal processes. In an effort to
distinguish between primary Zn isotope fractionation during chondrule formation
and secondary alteration, we here report the Zn isotope data of five chondrule
cores, five corresponding igneous rims and two matrices of the relatively
unaltered Leoville CV3.1 chondrite. The detail required for these analyses
necessitated the development of an adjusted Zn isotope analyses protocol
outlined in this study.

  Analysis in Diverse Domains",Accepted to COLING 2018,,,,cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Domain adaptation for sentiment analysis is challenging due to the fact that
supervised classifiers are very sensitive to changes in domain. The two most
prominent approaches to this problem are structural correspondence learning and
autoencoders. However, they either require long training times or suffer
greatly on highly divergent domains. Inspired by recent advances in
cross-lingual sentiment analysis, we provide a novel perspective and cast the
domain adaptation problem as an embedding projection task. Our model takes as
input two mono-domain embedding spaces and learns to project them to a
bi-domain space, which is jointly optimized to (1) project across domains and
to (2) predict sentiment. We perform domain adaptation experiments on 20
source-target domain pairs for sentiment classification and report novel
state-of-the-art results on 11 domain pairs, including the Amazon domain
adaptation datasets and SemEval 2013 and 2016 datasets. Our analysis shows that
our model performs comparably to state-of-the-art approaches on domains that
are similar, while performing significantly better on highly divergent domains.

presidential election remains to be clarified. Here, we use a dataset of 171
million tweets in the five months preceding the election day to identify 30
million tweets, from 2.2 million users, which contain a link to news outlets.
Based on a classification of news outlets curated by www.opensources.co, we
find that 25% of these tweets spread either fake or extremely biased news. We
characterize the networks of information flow to find the most influential
spreaders of fake and traditional news and use causal modeling to uncover how
fake news influenced the presidential election. We find that, while top
influencers spreading traditional center and left leaning news largely
influence the activity of Clinton supporters, this causality is reversed for
the fake news: the activity of Trump supporters influences the dynamics of the
top fake news spreaders.
