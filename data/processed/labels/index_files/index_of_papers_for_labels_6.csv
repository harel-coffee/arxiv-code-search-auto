1508.01146,Michael Beyer,Michael E. Beyer,"Minimizing the CDF Path Length: A Novel Perspective on Uniformity and
  Uncertainty of Bounded Distributions","Draft Paper/Idea Sketch. 13 pages, 5 figures",,,,stat.ME math.ST stat.TH,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  An index of uniformity is developed as an alternative to the maximum-entropy
principle for selecting continuous, differentiable probability distributions
$\mathcal{P}$ subject to constraints $C$. The uniformity index developed in
this paper is motivated by the observation that among all differentiable
probability distributions defined on a finite interval $[a,b] \in \mathbb{R}$,
it is the uniform probability distribution that minimizes the path length of
the associated cumulative distribution function $F_{\mathcal{P}}$ on $[a,b]$.
This intuition is extended to situations where there are constraints on the
allowable probability distributions. In particular, constraints on the first
and second raw moments of a distribution are discussed in detail, including the
analytical form of the solutions and numerical studies of particular examples.
The resulting ""shortest path"" distributions are found to be decidedly more
heavy-tailed than the associated maximum-entropy distributions, suggesting that
entropy and ""CDF path length"" measure two different aspects of uncertainty for
bounded distributions.

  Antonia Huertas, Jo\~ao Marcos, Mar\'ia Manzano, Sophie Pinchinat,
  Fran\c{c}ois Schwarzentruber",,,,cs.CY cs.LO,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Real-life conjectures do not come with instructions saying whether they they
should be proven or, instead, refuted. Yet, as we now know, in either case the
final argument produced had better be not just convincing but actually
verifiable in as much detail as our need for eliminating risk might require.
For those who do not happen to have direct access to the realm of mathematical
truths, the modern field of formalized mathematics has quite a few lessons to
contribute, and one might pay heed to what it has to say, for instance, about:
the importance of employing proof strategies; the fine control of automation in
unraveling the structure of a certain proof object; reasoning forward from the
givens and backward from the goals, in developing proof scripts; knowing when
and how definitions and identities apply in a helpful way, and when they do not
apply; seeing proofs [and refutations] as dynamical objects, not reflected by
the static derivation trees that Proof Theory wants them to be. I believe that
the great challenge for teachers and learners resides currently less on the
availability of suitable generic tools than in combining them wisely in view of
their preferred education paradigms and introducing them in a way that best
fits their specific aims, possibly with the help of intelligent online
interactive tutoring systems. As a proof of concept, a computerized proof
assistant that makes use of several successful tools already freely available
on the market and that takes into account some of the above findings about
teaching and learning Logic is hereby introduced. To fully account for our
informed intuitions on the subject it would seem that a little bit extra
technology would still be inviting, but no major breakthrough is really needed:
We are talking about tools that are already within our reach to develop, as the
fruits of collaborative effort.

software development and other knowledge work domains.
  In this paper, we explore how chatbots can help reduce the friction points

friction stemming from team interactions with each other, an individual's
interactions with technology, and team interactions with technology. Finally,
we provide a set of open questions for discussion within the research

contagion. These infections, which were transmitted from one individual to
another via posts on social media, included games such as 'neknomination', 'ice

first profile pictures. Fitting a mathematical model of infectious disease
transmission to outbreaks of these four games in the United Kingdom, I
estimated the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, and generation time of each
infection. Median estimates for $R_0$ ranged from 1.9-2.5 across the four
outbreaks, and the estimated generation times were between 1.0 and 2.0 days.
Tests using out-of-sample data from Australia suggested that the model had
reasonable predictive power, with $R^2$ values between 0.52-0.70 across the
four Australian datasets. Further, the relatively low basic reproduction
numbers for the infections suggests that only 48-60% of index cases in
nomination-based games may subsequently generate major outbreaks.

advanced model compression methods, like the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, have
already been implemented on federated learning to reduce the model size and
communication cost. However, Backdoor Attack can compromise its implementation
in the federated learning scenario. The malicious edge device trains the client
model with poisoned private data and uploads parameters to the center,
embedding a backdoor to the global shared model after unwitting aggregative
optimization. During the inference phase, the model with backdoors classifies
samples with a certain trigger as one target category, while shows a slight
decrease in inference accuracy to clean samples. In this work, we empirically
demonstrate that Lottery Ticket models are equally vulnerable to backdoor
attacks as the original dense models, and backdoor attacks can influence the
structure of extracted tickets. Based on tickets' similarities between each
other, we provide a feasible defense for federated learning against backdoor
attacks on various datasets.

convective terms approximation that is stable and reliable. The idea presented
here is that approximation approach has to correspond to the physical
phenomenon described by approximated terms. Pure convection (advection) that is
described by convective terms is transporting a property along the streamline,
and the information propagation is unidirectional, i.e., transported property
depends on previous values along the streamline but does not depend on the next
ones. The proposed approach represents streamlines on mesh as discrete
streamlines and is called Discrete Stream(line) Method (DStreaM). A discrete
streamline here is represented as a narrow triangle with one vertex of the
approximated node and two others neighbor upstream nodes. Discrete streamlines
are orientated using local flow direction as skew upwind schemes. DStreaM
corresponds to pure convection. Here are considered standard test problems:
advection of a step profile, advection of a double-step profile, advection of a
sinusoidal profile, and Smith and Hutton problem. DStreaM solutions were
compared with upwind-first order scheme and second-order Total Variation
Diminishing (TVD) schemes with limiters Min-Mod, QUICK, and SUPERBEE solutions.
DStreaM demonstrated second-order accuracy and rapid convergence. Upwind and
DStreaM need 2 or 4 iterations to reach a final solution while TVD schemes need
from 15 to 93.5 more iterations. DStreaM approach looks promising for
calculation of convective-dominated problems because it approximates naturally
first derivatives and is straightforwardly applicable as a meshfree method or
on unstructured meshes.

management policy for electric vehicle (EV) charging service providers. In the
presence of renewable energy integration and energy storage system, EV charging
service providers must deal with multiple uncertainties --- charging demand
volatility, inherent intermittency of renewable energy generation, and
wholesale electricity price fluctuation. The motivation behind our work is to
offer guidelines for charging service providers to determine proper charging
prices and manage electricity to balance the competing objectives of improving
profitability, enhancing customer satisfaction, and reducing impact on power
grid in spite of these uncertainties. We propose a new metric to assess the
impact on power grid without solving complete power flow equations. To protect
service providers from severe financial losses, a safeguard of profit is
incorporated in the model. Two algorithms --- stochastic dynamic programming
(SDP) algorithm and greedy algorithm (benchmark algorithm) --- are applied to
derive the pricing and electricity procurement policy. A Pareto front of the
multiobjective optimization is derived. Simulation results show that using SDP
algorithm can achieve up to 7% profit gain over using greedy algorithm.
Additionally, we observe that the charging service provider is able to reshape
spatial-temporal charging demands to reduce the impact on power grid via
pricing signals.

with 23 dataset is analyzed in band 3, 6 and 7 and combined. The whole set of

range of 47000. The individual emission flux is measured at different date over
a period of 11 months in various components. Finally we analyze the Spectral
Energy Distribution (SED) in each different component, including the radio jet
and counter jet. The point sources detected in the field follow a similar
distribution to previous studies. The blazar flux shows large variation
especially in band 3. Different components are observed: core, radio jet and
newly detected counter jet, Hot Spot (HS) and a disky structure roughly
perpendicular to the jet. The HS emission is formed by a point source
surrounded by an extended emission. The viewing angle of the jet is about 30
with a Doppler factor of 1.6$. The HS is at a distance of 19 kpc from the
center. The SED analysis shows a strong variation of the core spectral index,
especially in band 3. The two components in the radio jet have roughly a flat
spectral index in band 6 and 7. Using these ALMA data the different weak and
extended components are detected. The analysis of both jets constrains the
geometrical distance of the HS to the center. The SED presents a different
shape in time and frequency for each component. Finally a new structure is
detected roughly perpendicular to the radio jet and a thermal emission origin
is currently favoured. Further observations at higher spatial resolution are
needed to confirm that hypothesis.

resilience thanks to the individuals' ability to cooperate even when densely
packed, mitigating their internal flow pattern to mix nutrients, fence the
immune system, and resist antibiotics$^{5-14}$. Production of an artificial
swarm on the micro-scale faces a serious challenge $\frac{\;\;}{\;\;}$ while an
individual bacterium has an evolutionary-forged internal machinery to produce
propulsion, until now, artificial micro-swimmers relied on the precise chemical
composition of their environment to directly fuel their drive$^{14-23}$. When
crowded, artificial micro-swimmers compete locally for a finite fuel supply,
quenching each other's activity at their greatest propensity for cooperation.
Here we introduce an artificial micro-swimmer that consumes no chemical fuel
and is driven solely by light. We couple a light absorbing particle to a fluid
droplet, forming a colloidal chimera that transforms light energy into
propulsive thermo-capillary action. The swimmers' internal drive allows them to
operate and remain active for a long duration (days) and their effective
repulsive interaction allows for a high density fluid phase. We find that above
a critical concentration, swimmers form a long lived crowded state that
displays internal dynamics. When passive particles are introduced, the dense
swimmer phase can re-arrange and spontaneously corral the passive particles. We
derive a geometrical, depletion-like condition for corralling by identifying
the role the passive particles play in controlling the effective concentration

ML models on datasets with public features and sensitive private labels.
Despite its rigorous privacy guarantee, it has been observed that in practice
LDP does not preclude label inference attacks (LIAs): Models trained with LDP
can be evaluated on the public training features to recover, with high
accuracy, the very private labels that it was designed to protect. In this
work, we argue that this phenomenon is not paradoxical and that LDP merely
limits the advantage of an LIA adversary compared to predicting training labels
using the Bayes classifier. At LDP $\epsilon=0$ this advantage is zero, hence
the optimal attack is to predict according to the Bayes classifier and is
independent of the training labels. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that
our result closely captures the behavior of simulated attacks on both synthetic
and real world datasets.

INO-ICAL detector will require approximately 30,000 of 2m$\times$2m Resistive
Plate Chambers (RPC) as sensitive detectors and proposed to operate for about
20 years. For success of the experiment, each of the RPCs has to function
without showing any significant aging during the period of operation. Hence,
various tests including a proper leak test are performed during and after
production. The methods of leak rate calculation using conventional manometer
are valid only when both the volume of the test subject and ambient pressure
are kept constant. But both these quantities for a RPC gas gap depend widely on
the ambient pressure and temperature. A proper quantitative estimation of the
leak rate cannot be acquired from such pressure measurements. By monitoring the
absolute pressures, both outside and inside of an RPC, along with the
temperature, its leakage rate can be estimated. During the test period, the
supporting button spacers inside an RPC may get detached due to manufacturing
defect. This effect also needs to be detected.

CPU-intensive reactive transport models (RTMs): Gaussian processes (GPs),
polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and deep neural networks (DNNs). Besides
direct emulation of the simulated uranium concentration time series, replacing
the original RTM by its emulator is also investigated for global sensitivity
analysis (GSA), uncertainty propagation (UP) and probabilistic calibration
using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. The selected DNN is found to be
superior to both GPs and PCE in reproducing the input - output behavior of the
considered 8-dimensional and 13-dimensional CPU-intensive RTMs. Furthermore,
the two used PCE variants: standard PCE and sparse PCE (sPCE) appear to always
provide the least accuracy while not differing much in performance. As a
consequence of its better emulation capabilities, the used DNN outperforms the
two other methods for UP. In addition, DNNs and GPs offer equally good
approximations to the true first-order and total-order Sobol sensitivity
indices while PCE does somewhat less well. Most surprisingly, despite its
superior emulation skills the DNN approach leads to the worst solution of the
considered synthetic inverse problem which involves 1224 measurement data with
low noise. This apparently contradicting behavior is at least partially due to
the small but complicated deterministic noise that affects the DNN-based
predictions. Indeed, this complex error structure can drive the emulated
solutions far away from the true posterior distribution. Overall, our findings
indicate that when the available training set is relatively small (75 - to 500
input - output examples) and fixed beforehand, DNNs can well emulate RTMs but
are not suited to emulation-based inversion. In contrast, GPs perform fairly
well across all considered tasks: direct emulation, GSA, UP, and inversion.

1702.04912,Paolo Capriotti,Paolo Capriotti,Models of Type Theory with Strict Equality,,,,,cs.LO,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  This thesis introduces the idea of two-level type theory, an extension of
Martin-L\""of type theory that adds a notion of strict equality as an internal
primitive.
  A type theory with a strict equality alongside the more conventional form of
equality, the latter being of fundamental importance for the recent innovation
of homotopy type theory (HoTT), was first proposed by Voevodsky, and is usually
referred to as HTS.
  Here, we generalise and expand this idea, by developing a semantic framework
that gives a systematic account of type formers for two-level systems, and
proving a conservativity result relating back to a conventional type theory
like HoTT.
  Finally, we show how a two-level theory can be used to provide partial
solutions to open problems in HoTT. In particular, we use it to construct
semi-simplicial types, and lay out the foundations of an internal theory of
$(\infty, 1)$-categories.

that the ideal strengths decrease significantly as the atomic number increases,
while the critical strains change not so much. In particular, the ideal

lengths, and bond angles are also studied under different types of strains. It

have two significant drawbacks. Firstly, inefficient ranking function to

accuracy and inattention to other evaluation metrics such as diversity. This
paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning based recommendation system by
utilizing Actor-Critic architecture to model dynamic users' interaction with
the recommender agent and maximize the expected long-term reward. Furthermore,
we propose utilizing Spotify's ANNoy algorithm to find the most similar items
to generated action by actor-network. After that, the Total Diversity Effect
Ranking algorithm is used to generate the recommendations concerning relevancy
and diversity. Moreover, we apply positional encoding to compute
representations of the user's interaction sequence without using
sequence-aligned recurrent neural networks. Extensive experiments on the
MovieLens dataset demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate a
diverse while relevance recommendation list based on the user's preferences.

handle sequential data. The model reads a sequence one symbol at a time. Each
symbol is processed based on information collected from the previous symbols.
With existing RNN architectures, each symbol is processed using only
information from the previous processing step. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a new kind of RNN model that computes a recurrent weighted average
(RWA) over every past processing step. Because the RWA can be computed as a
running average, the computational overhead scales like that of any other RNN
architecture. The approach essentially reformulates the attention mechanism
into a stand-alone model. The performance of the RWA model is assessed on the
variable copy problem, the adding problem, classification of artificial
grammar, classification of sequences by length, and classification of the MNIST
images (where the pixels are read sequentially one at a time). On almost every
task, the RWA model is found to outperform a standard LSTM model.

combines simple arithmetic operations on stored samples of the hyperbolic

  and submitted to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society in
  this form",,,,astro-ph.GA,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We consider disk stability in the quasi-linear formulation of MOND (QUMOND),
the basis for some $N$-body integrators. We generalize the Toomre criterion for
the stability of disks to tightly wound, axisymmetric perturbations. We apply
this to a family of thin exponential disks with different central surface
densities. By numerically calculating their QUMOND rotation curves, we obtain
the minimum radial velocity dispersion required for stability against local
self-gravitating collapse.
  MOND correctly predicts much higher rotation speeds in low surface brightness
galaxies (LSBs) than does Newtonian dynamics without dark matter. Newtonian
models thus require putative very massive halos, whose inert nature implies
they would strongly stabilize the disk.
  MOND also increases the stability of galactic disks, but in contradistinction
to Newtonian gravity, this extra stability is limited to a factor of 2. MOND is
thus rather more conducive to the formation of bars and spiral arms. Therefore,
observation of such features in LSBs could be problematic for Newtonian galaxy
models. This could constitute a crucial discriminating test. We quantitatively
account for these facts in QUMOND.
  We also compare numerical QUMOND rotation curves of thin exponential disks to
those predicted by two algebraic expressions commonly used to calculate MOND
rotation curves. For the choice that best approximates QUMOND, we find the
circular velocities agree to within 1.5% beyond $\approx 0.5$ disk scale
lengths, regardless of the central surface density. The other expression can
underestimate the rotational speed by up to 12.5% at one scale length, though
rather less so at larger radii.

that the lattices of Khot behave nicely under tensorization. At the heart of

management. In this paper, we introduce a neural network model called Extreme
Learning Machine (ELM) for interval prediction of short-term traffic volume and
improve it with the heuristic particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). The
hybrid PSO-ELM model can generate the prediction intervals under different
confidence levels and guarantee the quality by minimizing a multi-objective
function which considers two criteria reliability and interval sharpness. The
PSO-ELM models are built based on an hourly traffic dataset and compared with
ARMA and Kalman Filter models. The results show that ARMA models are the worst

Kalman Filter is updated in an online approach. Additionally, only the PSO-ELMs

attracting increasing attention for both the remarkable artifacts they produce,
but also because of the vast conceptual difference between how they are
programmed and what they do. DNNs are 'black boxes' where high-level behavior
is not explicitly programmed, but emerges from the complex interactions of
thousands or millions of simple computational elements. Their behavior is often
described in anthropomorphic terms that can be misleading, seem magical, or
stoke fears of an imminent singularity in which machines become 'more' than
human. In this paper, we examine 5 distinct behavioral characteristics
associated with creativity, and provide an example of a mechanisms from
generative deep learning architectures that give rise to each these
characteristics. All 5 emerge from machinery built for purposes other than the
creative characteristics they exhibit, mostly classification. These mechanisms
of creative generative capabilities thus demonstrate a deep kinship to
computational perceptual processes. By understanding how these different
behaviors arise, we hope to on one hand take the magic out of anthropomorphic
descriptions, but on the other, to build a deeper appreciation of machinic
forms of creativity on their own terms that will allow us to nurture their
further development.

built on atomic or molecular ions. The lifetimes of the circular Rydberg states
can be in the millisecond range. That prevents inherent metastability of the
Rydberg atoms to influence computation at the typical decoherence times, which
are now being achieved in the range of 1 ms. The paper proposes to use a
pinning potential of an image charge on a cryogenic substrate (liquid He, in
particular) to confine large densities of Rydberg atoms to dielectric surfaces.
The substrate can also act as a natural cooler medium. A design of the computer

48 is carved by an unseen binary companion. We use 3D dust-gas
smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations to demonstrate that marginally
coupled dust grains concentrate in the gas over-density that forms in in the
cavity around a low binary mass ratio binary. This produces high contrast ratio
dust asymmetries at the cavity edge similar to those observed in the disc
around IRS 48 and other transition discs. This structure was previously assumed
to be a vortex. However, we show that the observed velocity map of IRS 48
displays a peculiar asymmetry that is not predicted by the vortex hypothesis.
We show the unusual kinematics are naturally explained by the non-Keplerian
flow of gas in an eccentric circumbinary cavity. We further show that
perturbations observed in the isovelocity curves of IRS 48 may be explained as
the product of the dynamical interaction between the companion and the disc.
The presence of a $\sim$0.4 M$_{\odot}$ companion at a $\sim$10 au separation
can qualitatively explain these observations. High spatial resolution line and
continuum imaging should be able to confirm this hypothesis.

resulting subclass space to generate a subclass representation for the image.
The novelty of the approach is that subclass representations make use of not
only the content of the photos themselves, but also information on the
co-occurrence of their tags, which determines membership in both subclasses and
top-level classes. The novelty is also that the images are classified into
smaller classes, which have a chance of being more visually stable and easier
to model. These subclasses are used as a latent space and images are
represented in this space by their probability of relatedness to all of the
subclasses. In contrast to approaches directly modeling each top-level class
based on the image content, the proposed method can exploit more information
for visually diverse classes. The approach is evaluated on a set of $2$ million

wide-field, high cadence optical time-domain surveys, raises the possibility of
the first joint GW-electromagnetic (EM) detections of core-collapse supernovae
(CCSNe). For targeted searches of GWs from CCSNe optical observations can be
used to increase the sensitivity of the search by restricting the relevant time
interval, defined here as the GW search window (GSW). The extent of the GSW is
a critical factor in determining the achievable false alarm probability (FAP)
for a triggered CCSN search. The ability to constrain the GSW from optical
observations depends on how early a CCSN is detected, as well as the ability to
model the early optical emission. Here we present several approaches to
constrain the GSW, ranging in complexity from model-independent analytical fits
of the early light curve, model-dependent fits of the rising or entire light
curve, and a new data-driven approach using existing well-sampled CCSN light
curves from {\it Kepler} and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).
We use these approaches to determine the time of core-collapse and its
associated uncertainty (i.e., the GSW). We apply our methods to two Type II SNe
that occurred during LIGO/Virgo Observing Run 3: SN\,2019fcn and SN\,2019ejj

input to the problem is an undirected edge-weighted graph with distinguished

at least its weight. The objective is to minimize the sum of the assigned

  MSPEC is a graph generalization of a barrier coverage problem in a wireless
sensor network: given a set of unit disks with centers in a rectangle, what is
the minimum total amount by which we must shrink the disks to permit an
intruder to cross the rectangle undetected, i.e. without entering any disc.
This is a more sophisticated measure of barrier coverage than the minimum
number of disks whose removal breaks the barrier.

give polynomial time algorithms for the special cases where the edge weights
are uniform, or the power values are restricted to a bounded set. Although
MSPEC is related to network flow and matching problems, its computational
complexity (in P or NP-hard) remains open.

focuses on the optimization problem of the signalized intersection connected to
freeway on-ramps. Conflicts are often observed between the traffic heading to
an on-ramp and the traffic continuing straight which leads to issues such as
intersection overflow, increased delay, and concerns about safety. For studying
this problem, a real-world signalized intersection in Buffalo, New York was
chosen, which has two through lanes and one short shared (through and
right-turn) lane. At the downstream of the intersection are two following
on-ramps, one to the highway I-290 West and the other to I-290 East. During
peak hours, the shared lane often observes a long queue, which furthermore
blocks the through traffic on the parallel lane. To solve this problem, a
VISSIM agent-based simulation model was built and calibrated based on field
observations. Three potential optimization solutions were proposed and tested
with the help of VISSIM: (1) increasing the length of the short shared through
and right-turn lane; (2) making the short shared through and right-turn lane
right-turn only, and (3) adding a new diverge lane for the right-turn vehicles.
According to the simulation results, solution (3) performs the best, resulting
in the least vehicle delay time.

learning on that instance can be improved and if not, the network learns with
confidence that this instance can be safely abandoned. We also propose MARVEL+,
where arduous instances can be upweighted, enabling the network to focus and
improve its learning on them and consequently its generalization. Experimental

convolutional neural network (CNN) has received considerable attention.
Depending on whether intermediate cues are used, the relevant literature can be
roughly divided into two broad categories: direct methods and two stage
pipelines. For the latter, intermediate cues, such as 3D object coordinates,
semantic keypoints, or virtual control points instead of pose parameters are
regressed by CNN in the first stage. Object pose can then be solved by
correspondence constraints constructed with these intermediate cues. In this
paper, we focus on the postprocessing of a two-stage pipeline and propose to
combine two learning concepts for estimating object pose under challenging
scenes: projection grouping on one side, and correspondence learning on the
other. We firstly employ a local patch based method to predict projection
heatmaps which denote the confidence distribution of projection of 3D bounding
box's corners. A projection grouping module is then proposed to remove
redundant local maxima from each layer of heatmaps. Instead of directly feeding
2D-3D correspondences to the perspective-n-point (PnP) algorithm, multiple
correspondence hypotheses are sampled from local maxima and its corresponding
neighborhood and ranked by a correspondence-evaluation network. Finally,
correspondences with higher confidence are selected to determine object pose.

aim of exposing the students to Gaussian Processes (GPs). GPs are
non-parametric Bayesian regression models that are largely used by
statisticians and geospatial data scientists for modeling spatial data. Several
open source libraries spanning from Matlab [1], Python [2], R [3] etc., are
already available for simple plug-and-use. The objective of this handout and in
turn the website was to allow the users to develop stand-alone GPs in Python by
relying on minimal external dependencies. To this end, we only use the default
python modules and assist the users in developing their own GPs from scratch
giving them an in-depth knowledge of what goes on under the hood. The module
covers GP inference using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and gives
examples of 1D (dummy) spatial data.

applications including image, speech, text, and data analysis. Use of ML to
understand underlying patterns in gene mutations (genomics) has far-reaching
results, not only in overcoming diagnostic pitfalls, but also in designing
treatments for life-threatening diseases like cancer. Success and
sustainability of ML algorithms depends on the quality and diversity of data
collected and used for training. Under-representation of groups (ethnic groups,
gender groups, etc.) in such a dataset can lead to inaccurate predictions for
certain groups, which can further exacerbate systemic discrimination issues.
  In this work, we propose TRAPDOOR, a methodology for identification of biased
datasets by repurposing a technique that has been mostly proposed for nefarious
purposes: Neural network backdoors. We consider a typical collaborative
learning setting of the genomics supply chain, where data may come from
hospitals, collaborative projects, or research institutes to a central cloud
without awareness of bias against a sensitive group. In this context, we
develop a methodology to leak potential bias information of the collective data
without hampering the genuine performance using ML backdooring catered for
genomic applications. Using a real-world cancer dataset, we analyze the dataset
with the bias that already existed towards white individuals and also
introduced biases in datasets artificially, and our experimental result show
that TRAPDOOR can detect the presence of dataset bias with 100% accuracy, and
furthermore can also extract the extent of bias by recovering the percentage
with a small error.

power of shape representation for matching disparate image pairs, is proposed.
Disparate image pairs are deemed those that exhibit strong affine variations in
scale, viewpoint and projection parameters accompanied by the presence of
partial or complete occlusion of objects and extreme variations in ambient
illumination. Under these challenging conditions, neither local nor global
feature-based image matching methods, when used in isolation, have been
observed to be effective. The proposed correspondence determination scheme for
matching disparate images exploits high-level shape cues that are derived from
low-level local feature descriptors, thus combining the best of both worlds. A
graph-based representation for the disparate image pair is generated by
constructing an affinity matrix that embeds the distances between feature
points in two images, thus modeling the correspondence determination problem as
one of graph matching. The eigenspectrum of the affinity matrix, i.e., the
learned global shape representation, is then used to further regress the
transformation or homography that defines the correspondence between the source
image and target image. The proposed scheme is shown to yield state-of-the-art
results for both, coarse-level shape matching as well as fine point-wise
correspondence determination.

distributed agreement is necessary for consistency. With an increasing number
of servers, these systems become more susceptible to single-server failures,
increasing the relevance of fault-tolerance. Atomic broadcast enables
fault-tolerant distributed agreement, yet it is costly to solve. Most practical
algorithms entail linear work per broadcast message. AllConcur -- a leaderless
approach -- reduces the work, by connecting the servers via a sparse resilient
overlay network; yet, this resiliency entails redundancy, limiting the
reduction of work. In this paper, we propose AllConcur+, an atomic broadcast
algorithm that lifts this limitation: During intervals with no failures, it
achieves minimal work by using a redundancy-free overlay network. When failures
do occur, it automatically recovers by switching to a resilient overlay
network. In our performance evaluation of non-failure scenarios, AllConcur+
achieves comparable throughput to AllGather -- a non-fault-tolerant distributed
agreement algorithm -- and outperforms AllConcur, LCR and Libpaxos both in
terms of throughput and latency. Furthermore, our evaluation of failure
scenarios shows that AllConcur+'s expected performance is robust with regard to
occasional failures. Thus, for realistic use cases, leveraging redundancy-free
distributed agreement during intervals with no failures improves performance
significantly.

challenges service providers with the objective to maximize the number of

ensuring their fixed quality of service (QoS), e.g., the amount of computing

consider dynamic QoS levels for app users, which generalizes but further
complicates the EUA problem, turning it into a dynamic QoS EUA problem. This
enables flexible levels of quality of experience (QoE) for app users. We

occlusion in crowded scenes, where the state-of-the-art approaches adopt
homography transformations to project multi-view features to the ground plane.
However, we find that these 2D transformations do not take into account the
object's height, and with this neglection features along the vertical direction
of same object are likely not projected onto the same ground plane point,
leading to impure ground-plane features. To solve this problem, we propose VFA,
voxelized 3D feature aggregation, for feature transformation and aggregation in
multi-view detection. Specifically, we voxelize the 3D space, project the
voxels onto each camera view, and associate 2D features with these projected
voxels. This allows us to identify and then aggregate 2D features along the
same vertical line, alleviating projection distortions to a large extent.
Additionally, because different kinds of objects (human vs. cattle) have
different shapes on the ground plane, we introduce the oriented Gaussian
encoding to match such shapes, leading to increased accuracy and efficiency. We
perform experiments on multiview 2D detection and multiview 3D detection

and efficient execution on large-scale compute platforms is the object of
extensive research and development. For these efforts to be successful, a solid
experimental methodology is needed to evaluate workflow algorithms and systems.
A foundation for this methodology is the availability of realistic workflow
instances. Dozens of workflow instances for a few scientific applications are
available in public repositories. While these are invaluable, they are limited:
workflow instances are not available for all application scales of interest. To
address this limitation, previous work has developed generators of synthetic,
but representative, workflow instances of arbitrary scales. These generators
are popular, but implementing them is a manual, labor-intensive process that
requires expert application knowledge. As a result, these generators only
target a handful of applications, even though hundreds of applications use
workflows in production.
  In this work, we present WfChef, a framework that fully automates the process
of constructing a synthetic workflow generator for any scientific application.
Based on an input set of workflow instances, WfChef automatically produces a
synthetic workflow generator. We define and evaluate several metrics for
quantifying the realism of the generated workflows. Using these metrics, we
compare the realism of the workflows generated by WfChef generators to that of
the workflows generated by the previously available, hand-crafted generators.
We find that the WfChef generators not only require zero development effort
(because it is automatically produced), but also generate workflows that are
more realistic than those generated by hand-crafted generators.

prefers high-frequency tokens, which results in low-diversity responses. We
then propose a Frequency-Aware Cross-Entropy (FACE) loss function that improves
over the CE loss function by incorporating a weighting mechanism conditioned on

species carried out with the Quantum Theory of Atoms-In-Molecules [Anderson et

topological features in the electron density, that relativistic effects yielded
non-covalent interactions between gold and hydrogen atoms, we show from their
low persistence values (which decrease with increased basis set size) these
features are not significant. Further analysis of the reduced density gradient
confirms no relativity-induced non-covalent interactions in Au4-S-C6H4-S'-Au'4.

geometric mean is more appropriate than the arithmetic mean. However, the
geometric mean has a serious limitation in comparison with the arithmetic mean.
Means are used to summarize the information in a large set of values in a
single number; yet, the geometric mean of a data set with at least one zero is
always zero. As a result, the geometric mean does not capture any information
about the non-zero values. The purpose of this short contribution is to review
solutions proposed in the literature that enable the computation of the
geometric mean of data sets containing zeros and to show that they do not
fulfil the `recovery' or `monotonicity' conditions that we define. The standard
geometric mean should be recovered from the modified geometric mean if the data
set does not contain any zeros (recovery condition). Also, if the values of an
ordered data set are greater one by one than the values of another data set

programming languages. Then it describes the current implementation, used tools
and major implementation decisions including how to implement a stable,
portable and simple JIT compiler.
  We study the effect of major implementation decisions on the performance of
Dino on x86-64, AARCH64, and Powerpc64. In brief, the performance of some model
benchmark on x86-64 was improved by $\textbf{3.1}$ times after moving from a
stack based virtual machine to a register-transfer architecture, a further
$\textbf{1.5}$ times by adding byte code combining, a further $\textbf{2.3}$
times through the use of JIT, and a further $\textbf{4.4}$ times by performing
type inference with byte code specialization, with a resulting overall
performance improvement of about $\textbf{47}$ times. To put these results in
context, we include performance comparisons of Dino with widely used
implementations of Ruby, Python 3, PyPy and JavaScript on the three platforms
mentioned above.
  The goal of this article is to share the experience of Dino implementation
with other dynamic language implementors in hope that it can help them to
improve implementation of popular dynamic languages to make them probably
faster and more portable, using less developer resources, and may be to avoid
some mistakes and wrong directions which were experienced during Dino
development.

mix two fluids, called reactant and buffer, in desired proportions. In one of
the technologies for fluid mixing the process can be represented by a directed
acyclic graph whose nodes represent micro-mixers and edges represent
micro-channels. A micro-mixer has two input channels and two output channels;
it receives two fluid droplets, one from each input, mixes them perfectly, and
produces two droplets of the mixed fluid on its output channels. Such a mixing
graph converts a set I of input droplets into a set T of output droplets, where
the droplets are specified by their reactant concentrations. The most
fundamental algorithmic question related to mixing graphs is to determine,
given an input set I and a target set T, whether there is a mixing graph that
converts I into T. We refer to this decision problem as mix-reachability. While
the complexity of this problem remains open, we provide a solution to its
natural sub-problem, called perfect mixability, in which we ask whether, given
a collection C of droplets, there is a mixing graph that mixes C perfectly,
producing only droplets whose concentration is the average concentration of C.
We provide a complete characterization of such perfectly mixable sets and an
efficient algorithm for testing perfect mixability. Further, we prove that any
perfectly mixable set has a perfect-mixing graph of polynomial size, and that
this graph can be computed in polynomial time.

it to reach a wider audience. Second, due to various user-generated content
platforms it has become possible for anyone to get involved, streaming their
own content to the world. This emerging trend of going live usually happens via
social platforms, where users perform live social broadcasts predominantly from
their mobile devices, allowing their friends (and the general public) to engage
with the stream in real-time. With the growing popularity of such platforms,
the burden on the current Internet infrastructure is therefore expected to
multiply. With this in mind, we explore one such prominent platform - Facebook
Live. We gather 3TB of data, representing one month of global activity and
explore the characteristics of live social broadcast. From this, we derive
simple yet effective principles which can decrease the network burden. We then
dissect global and hyper-local properties of the video while on-air, by
capturing the geography of the broadcasters or the users who produce the video
and the viewers or the users who interact with it. Finally, we study the social
engagement while the video is live and distinguish the key aspects when the

its name, many attributes of Facebook Live deviate from both the concepts of

fluctuations, modifying their properties in a slight but measurable way.
Recently, the Planck Collaboration released the estimated convergence map, an
integrated measure of the large-scale matter distribution that produced the
weak gravitational lensing (WL) phenomenon observed in Planck CMB data. We
perform exhaustive analyses of this convergence map calculating the variance in
small and large regions of the sky, but excluding the area masked due to
galactic contaminations, and compare them with the features expected in the set
of simulated convergence maps, also released by the Planck collaboration. Our
goal is to search for sky directions or regions where the WL imprints anomalous
signatures to the variance estimator revealed through a $\chi^2$ analyses at a
statistically significant level. In the local analysis of the Planck
convergence map we identified 8 patches of the sky in disagreement, in more
than 2$\sigma$, with what is observed in the average of the simulations. In
contrast, in the large regions analysis we found no statistically significant
discrepancies, but, interestingly, the regions with the highest $\chi^2$ values
are surrounding the ecliptic poles. Thus, our results show a good agreement
with the features expected by the $\Lambda$CDM concordance model, as given by
the simulations. Yet, the outliers regions found here could suggest that the
data still contain residual contamination, like noise, due to over- or
under-estimation of systematic effects in the simulation data set.

the clinical context, a formal decision rule based on the prediction has the
potential to have a much broader impact. Even if it is not the intended use of
a developed prediction model, informal decision rules can often be found in
practice. The use of a prediction-based decision rule should be formalized and
compared to the standard of care in a randomized trial to assess its clinical

observational data can be used to propose a decision rule based on a prognostic

pre-trained weights when using global ROIs, as compared to 65.50% when using
local ROIs. Conclusion: The experiments demonstrated the feasibility of the
deep learning technology in grading glaucoma severity. In particular, global
field-of-view images contain relatively richer information that may be critical
for glaucoma assessment, suggesting that we should use the entire field-of-view
of a fundus image for training a deep learning network.

mathematically as trying to make an estimating distribution the same as an
unknown ground truth distribution. This can then be quantified in terms of the
value of a statistical divergence between the two distributions. We outline the
maximum likelihood approach and how it can be interpreted as minimizing
KL-divergence. We explore a number of approaches in the maximum likelihood
family, while discussing their limitations. Finally, we explore the alternative
adversarial approach which involves studying the differences between an
estimating distribution and a real data distribution. We discuss how this
approach can give rise to new divergences and methods that are necessary to
make adversarial learning successful. We also discuss new evaluation metrics
which are required by the adversarial approach.

r\^ole of syntax and, before that, the very nature of syntax. Here, we will
assume that syntax is computing. And then, since we are computationally Turing
complete, we meet an evolutionary anomaly, the anomaly of sytax: we are
syntactically too competent for syntax. Assuming that problem solving is
computing, and realizing that the evolutionary advantage of Turing completeness
is full problem solving and not syntactic proficiency, we explain the anomaly
of syntax by postulating that syntax and problem solving co-evolved in humans
towards Turing completeness. Examining the requirements that full problem
solving impose on language, we find firstly that semantics is not sufficient
and that syntax is necessary to represent problems. Our final conclusion is
that full problem solving requires a functional semantics on an infinite
tree-structured syntax. Besides these results, the introduction of Turing
completeness and problem solving to explain the evolution of syntax should help
us to fit the evolution of language within the evolution of cognition, giving
us some new clues to understand the elusive relation between language and

possible mechanism for considerable mass-loss and splitting. We report a search
for spin changes for three large Jupiter-family comets (JFCs): 14P/Wolf,
143P/Kowal-Mrkos, and 162P/Siding Spring. None of the three comets has
detectable period changes, and we set conservative upper limits of 4.2 (14P),
6.6 (143P) and 25 (162P) minutes per orbit. Comparing these results with all
eight other JFCs with measured rotational changes, we deduce that none of the
observed large JFCs experiences significant spin changes. This suggests that
large comet nuclei are less likely to undergo rotationally-driven splitting,
and therefore more likely to survive more perihelion passages than smaller
nuclei. We find supporting evidence for this hypothesis in the cumulative size
distributions of JFCs and dormant comets, as well as in recent numerical
studies of cometary orbital dynamics. We added 143P to the sample of 13 other
JFCs with known albedos and phase-function slopes. This sample shows a possible
correlation of increasing phase-function slopes for larger geometric albedos.
Partly based on findings from recent space missions to JFCs, we hypothesise
that this correlation corresponds to an evolutionary trend for JFCs. We propose
that newly activated JFCs have larger albedos and steeper phase functions,
which gradually decrease due to sublimation-driven erosion. If confirmed, this
could be used to analyse surface erosion from ground and to distinguish between
dormant comets and asteroids.

for general linear multi-agent systems (MASs) with external disturbances and
heterogeneous time-varying input and communication delays under a directed
communication graph topology, containing a spanning tree. First, for all agents
whose state matrix has no eigenvalues with positive real parts, a
communication-delay-related observer, which is used to construct the
controller, is designed for followers to estimate the leader's state
information. Second, by means of the output regulation theory, the results are
relaxed to the case that only the leader's state matrix eigenvalues have
non-positive real parts and, under these relaxed conditions, the controller is
redesigned. Both cases lead to a closed-loop error system of which the
stability is guaranteed via a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional with sufficient
conditions in terms of input-delay-dependent linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).
An extended LMI is proposed which, in conjunction with the rest of LMIs,
results in a solution with a larger upper bound on delays than what would be
feasible without it. It is highlighted that the integration of
communication-delay-related observer and input-delay-related LMI to construct a
fully distributed controller (which requires no global information) is scalable
to arbitrarily large networks. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is
demonstrated via illustrative numerical examples.

journalist's disposal. The magnitude and direction of these biases are,
however, widely unknown. The absence of ground truth, the sheer size of the

for consumers and hence accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles. A major
barrier to shorter charge times is the accelerated aging of the battery at
higher charging rates, which can be driven by lithium plating, increased solid
electrolyte interphase growth due to elevated temperatures, and particle
cracking due to mechanical stress. Lithium plating depends on the overpotential
of the negative electrode, and mechanical stress depends on the concentration
gradient, both of which cannot be measured directly. Techniques based on
physics-based models of the battery and optimal control algorithms have been
developed to this end. While these methods show promise in reducing
degradation, their optimization algorithms' complexity can limit their
implementation. In this paper, we present a method based on the constant

ambiguous supervision in foreground, we involve extra correspondence prior with
a flow-depth consistency loss. The dense 2D correspondence of optical flows is
used to regularize the 3D stereo correspondence in MVS. To handle the invalid
supervision in background, we use Monte-Carlo Dropout to acquire the
uncertainty map and further filter the unreliable supervision signals on

Furthermore, the resulting condition is approaching $\mu<1/k$ for strongly

is investigated by solving the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic equations using
direct numerical simulations with droplets being modeled as Lagrangian
particles. The supersaturation field is calculated directly by simulating the
temperature and water vapor fields instead of being treated as a passive
scalar. Thermodynamic feedbacks to the fields due to condensation are also
included for completeness. We find that the width of droplet size distributions
increases with time, which is contrary to the classical theory without
supersaturation fluctuations, where condensational growth leads to
progressively narrower size distributions. Nevertheless, in agreement with
earlier Lagrangian stochastic models of the condensational growth, the standard
deviation of the surface area of droplets increases as $t^{1/2}$. Also, for the
first time, we explicitly demonstrate that the time evolution of the size
distribution is sensitive to the Reynolds number, but insensitive to the mean
energy dissipation rate. This is shown to be due to the fact that temperature
fluctuations and water vapor mixing ratio fluctuations increases with
increasing Reynolds number, therefore the resulting supersaturation
fluctuations are enhanced with increasing Reynolds number. Our simulations may
explain the broadening of the size distribution in stratiform clouds
qualitatively, where the mean updraft velocity is almost zero.

Parametrizations are used to represent diabatic processes such as radiative
transfer and cloud microphysics and account for sub-grid-scale motions and
variability. Unlike traditional approaches, neural networks (NNs) can readily
exploit recent observational datasets and global cloud-system resolving model
(CRM) simulations to learn subgrid variability. This article describes an NN
parametrization trained by coarse-graining a near-global CRM simulation with a
4~km horizontal grid spacing. The NN predicts the residual heating and
moistening averaged over (160 km)^2 grid boxes as a function of the
coarse-resolution fields within the same atmospheric column. This NN is coupled
to the dynamical core of a GCM with the same 160 km resolution. A recent study
described how to train such an NN to be numerically stable when coupled to
specified time-evolving advective forcings in a single column model, but
feedbacks between NN and GCM components cause spatially-extended simulations to
crash within a few days. Analyzing the linearized response of such an NN
reveals that it learns to exploit a strong synchrony between precipitation and
the atmospheric state above 10 km. Removing these variables from the NN's
inputs stabilizes the coupled simulations, which predict the future state more
accurately than a coarse-resolution simulation without any parametrizations of
sub-grid-scale variability, although the mean state slowly drifts.

dependent on tangible assets and more on intangible ones. In this context, the
role of human capital in the value creation process has become central. Despite
the large amount of scientific work on human capital phenomena, little research
has revealed the role of human capital in the process of creating value. The
purpose of this article is to evaluate the impact of human capital on value
creation within 31 classified hotels in Morocco for the period 2013-2015. This
paper is organized into four sections. First, we return to the main
conceptualization of value creation. The goal of this first section is to
synthesize prior work on this construct and highlight the main role of the
resource based view (RBV) in explaining it. This view presents the point that
links value creation to human capital given that this latter concept is one of
the most resources of the firm. Next, we present the main definition of human
capital. To do so, we make use of concepts from psychology, economy and
strategic human resource management. Then, we shed light on the existing
relationship between the two concepts of our research. Finally, we present the
methodology of this research as well as the results. The required data to
calculate value creation is obtained mainly from the annual reports of Moroccan
hotels. Whereas, human capital is assessed by a questionnaire using the scale
of Subramaniam and Youndt (2005). Data is examined using linear regression by
PASW statistics software. The results of this study give a more concrete
picture on the creation of value in this context and refute any link between
these two concepts.

enough, we observe that by choosing $L=H^{-1}$ as the IR cutoff for the HDE
with time varying $ c ^2(z) $ term, the present acceleration of the universe
expansion can be achieved, even in the absence of interaction between dark

$k$-edge connected components ($k$-ECCs) of a graph $G$ for a user-given $k$
has been extensively studied recently. In this paper, we investigate the
problem of constructing the hierarchy of edge connectivity-based graph
decomposition, which compactly represents the $k$-ECCs of a graph for all
possible $k$ values. This is based on the fact that each $k$-ECC is entirely
contained in a $(k-1)$-ECC. In contrast to the existing approaches that conduct
the computation either in a bottom-up or a top-down manner, we propose a binary
search-based framework which invokes a $k$-ECC computation algorithm as a black

for a specific $k$ value. We prove that the time complexity of our framework is
${\cal O}\big( (\log \delta(G))\times T_{kecc}(G)\big)$, where $\delta(G)$ is
the degeneracy of $G$ and equals the maximum value among the minimum vertex
degrees of all subgraphs of $G$. As $\delta(G)$ is typically small for
real-world graphs, this time complexity is optimal up to a logarithmic factor.

makes it possible to use a blocking scheme without any zero padding in the
matrix memory storage. We describe mask-based sparse matrix formats and their
corresponding SpMV kernels highly optimized in assembly language. Considering
that the optimal blocking size depends on the matrix, we also provide a method
to predict the best kernel to be used utilizing a simple interpolation of
results from previous executions. We compare the performance of our approach to
that of the Intel MKL CSR kernel and the CSR5 open-source package on a set of
standard benchmark matrices. We show that we can achieve significant
improvements in many cases, both for sequential and for parallel executions.
Finally, we provide the corresponding code in an open source library, called
SPC5.

a combination of the magneto-dipole radiation and dipole magnetic field decay
models. By introducing a mean rotation energy conversion coefficient
$\overline{\zeta}$, the ratio of the total high-energy photon energy to the
total rotation energy loss in the whole life of the pulsar, and combining the
pulsar's high-energy and timing observations with reliable nuclear equation of
state, we estimate the pulsar's initial spin period, $P_{0}\sim (17-44)$ ms,
corresponding to the moment of inertia $I\sim (0.8-2.1)\times 10^{45}$ g
cm$^{2}$. Assuming that PSR J1640$-$4631 has experienced a long-term
exponential decay of the dipole magnetic field, we calculate the true age
$t_{\rm age}$, the effective magnetic field decay timescale $\tau_{D}$, and the
initial surface dipole magnetic field at the pole $B_{p}(0)$ of the pulsar to
be $(2900-3100)$ yrs, $1.07(2)\times10^{5}$ yrs, and $(1.84-4.20)\times10^{13}$

atmosphere (between 120 and 190~km), the mass spectrometer MAVEN/NGIMS
(Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN/Neutral Gas Ion Mass Spectrometer) reveals
the local impact of gravity waves (GWs). This yields precious information on
the activity of GWs and the atmospheric conditions in which they propagate and
break. The intensity of GWs measured by MAVEN in the upper atmosphere has been
shown to be dictated by saturation processes in isothermal conditions. As a
result, GWs activity is correlated to the evolution of the inverse of the
background temperature. Previous data gathered at lower altitudes ($\sim$95 to
$\sim$150~km) during aerobraking by the accelerometers on board MGS (Mars
Global Surveyor), ODY (Mars Odyssey) and MRO (Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter) are
analyzed in the light of those recent findings with MAVEN. The anti-correlation
between GW-induced density perturbations and background temperature is
plausibly found in the ODY data acquired in the polar regions, but not in he
MGS and MRO data. MRO data in polar regions exhibit a correlation between the
density perturbations and the Brunt-V\""{a}is\""{a}l\""{a} frequency, obtained
from Global Climate Modeling. At lower altitude levels (between 100 and
120~km), although wave saturation might still be dominant, isothermal
conditions are no longer verified. In this case, theory predicts that the
intensity of GWs is no more correlated to background temperature, but to static
stability. At other latitudes in the three aerobraking datasets, the GW-induced
relative density perturbations are correlated with neither inverse temperature
nor static stability; in this particular case, this means that the observed
activity of GWs is not only controlled by saturation, but also by the effects
of GWs sources and wind filtering through critical levels.

have been widely examined in the literature, similar analyses regarding the
flow around and through porous ones are still lacking. In this work, the effect
of the porosity and permeability on the wake patterns of porous rectangular
cylinders is numerically investigated at low to moderate Reynolds numbers in
the framework of direct numerical simulation combined with local and global
stability analyses. A modified Darcy-Brinkman formulation is employed here so
as to describe the flow behavior inside the porous media, where also the
convective terms are retained to correctly account for the inertial effects at
high values of permeability. Different aspect ratios of the cylinder are
considered, varying the thickness-to-height ratios, t/d, from 0.01 (flat plate)
to 1.0 (square cylinder). The results show that the permeability of the bodies
has a strong effect in modifying the characteristics of the wakes and of the
associated flow instabilities, while the porosity weakly affects the resulting
flow patterns. In particular, the fluid flows through the porous bodies and,
thus, as the permeability is progressively increased, the recirculation
regions, initially attached to the rear part of the bodies, at first detach
from the body and, eventually, disappear even in the near wakes. Global
stability analyses lead to the identification of critical values of the
permeability above which any linear instability is prevented. Moreover, a
different scaling of the non-dimensional permeability allows to identify a
general threshold for all the configurations here studied that ensures the
suppression of vortex shedding, at least in the considered parameter space.

and processes that a person might encounter during childhood and adolescence,
have been proven to be linked to increased risks of a multitude of negative
health outcomes and conditions when children reach adulthood and beyond.
  Objective: To better understand the relationship between ACEs and their
relevant risk factors with associated health outcomes and to eventually design
and implement preventive interventions, access to an integrated coherent
dataset is needed. Therefore, we implemented a formal ontology as a resource to
allow the mental health community to facilitate data integration and knowledge
modeling and to improve ACEs surveillance and research.
  Methods: We use advanced knowledge representation and Semantic Web tools and
techniques to implement the ontology. The current implementation of the
ontology is expressed in the description logic ALCRIQ(D), a sublogic of Web
Ontology Language (OWL 2).
  Results: The ACEs Ontology has been implemented and made available to the
mental health community and the public via the BioPortal repository. Moreover,
multiple use-case scenarios have been introduced to showcase and evaluate the
usability of the ontology in action. The ontology was created to be used by
major actors in the ACEs community with different applications, from the
diagnosis of individuals and predicting potential negative outcomes that they
might encounter to the prevention of ACEs in a population and designing
interventions and policies.
  Conclusions: The ACEs Ontology provides a uniform and reusable semantic
network and an integrated knowledge structure for mental health practitioners
and researchers to improve ACEs surveillance and evaluation.

unravel such interactions based on the potentiometric mapping in the riverbank.
We had 60 stop sites along the riverbank for groundwater and river water level
observations, and chemical measurements (TDS, EC, temp, and pH). Three river
water gauge were also analyzed to see the fluctuations.
  We identified three types of hydrodynamic relationships with fairly low flow
gradients: effluent flow at Segmen I (Kranggan - Batuceper) with 0.2-0.25
gradient, perched flow at Segmen II (Batuceper-Kalibaru) with gradient
0.2-0.25, and influent flow at Segmen III (Kalibaru-Tanjungburung) with
gradient 0.15-0.20. Such low flow gradient is controlled by the moderate to low
morphological slope in the area. The gaining and losing stream model were also
supported by the river water fluctuation data. TDS and EC readings increased
more than 40$\%$ from upstream to downstream. At some points the both
measurements were two times higher than the permissible limits, along with the
drops of pH values at those areas.

including mobile broadband, critical and massive Internet of Things and are
used in a variety of scenarios. In many of these scenarios, the main challenge
is maintaining high throughput and ensuring proper quality of service (QoS) in
irregular topologies. In multiple input multiple output systems, this challenge
translates to designing linear transmit and receive beamformers that maximize
the system throughput and manage QoS constraints. In this paper, we argue that
this basic design task in 5G and beyond systems must be extended such that
beamforming design and user scheduling are managed jointly. Specifically, we
propose a fully decentralized joint beamforming design and user scheduling
algorithm that manages QoS. A novel feature of this scheme is its ability to
reduce the initial rate requirements in case of infeasibility. By means of
simulations that model contemporary 5G scenarios, we show that the proposed
decentralized scheme outperforms benchmarking algorithms that do not support
minimum rate requirements and previously proposed algorithms that support QoS
requirements.

of computational effects with parameters. The need of such a notion arises
when, for example, statically estimating the range of effects caused by a
program, or studying the ways in which effects with local scopes are derived
from effects with only the global scope. Extending the classical observation
that computational effects can be modeled by monads, these computational
effects with parameters are modeled by various mathematical structures
including graded monads and indexed monads, which are two different
generalizations of ordinary monads. The former has been employed in the
semantics of effect systems, whereas the latter in the study of the
relationship between the local state monads and the global state monads, each
exemplifying the two situations mentioned above. However, despite their
importance, the mathematical theory of graded and indexed monads is far less
developed than that of ordinary monads.
  Here we develop the mathematical theory of graded and indexed monads from a
2-categorical viewpoint. We first introduce four 2-categories and observe that
in two of them graded monads are in fact monads in the 2-categorical sense, and
similarly indexed monads are monads in the 2-categorical sense in the other
two. We then construct explicitly the Eilenberg--Moore and the Kleisli objects
of graded monads, and the Eilenberg--Moore objects of indexed monads in the
sense of Street in appropriate 2-categories among these four. The corresponding
results for graded and indexed comonads also follow.
  We expect that the current work will provide a theoretical foundation to a
unified study of computational effects with parameters, or dually (using the
comonad variants), of computational resources with parameters, arising for
example in Bounded Linear Logic.

cortical surface that have similar temporal dynamics across a patient
population, and concurrently estimates an average trajectory of vertex
measurements in each cluster. DIVE uniquely outputs a parcellation of the
cortex into areas with common progression patterns, leading to a new signature
for individual diseases. DIVE further estimates the disease stage and
progression speed for every visit of every subject, potentially enhancing
stratification for clinical trials or management. On simulated data, DIVE can
recover ground truth clusters and their underlying trajectory, provided the
average trajectories are sufficiently different between clusters. We
demonstrate DIVE on data from two cohorts: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) and the Dementia Research Centre (DRC), UK, containing
patients with Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) as well as typical Alzheimer's
disease (tAD). DIVE finds similar spatial patterns of atrophy for tAD subjects
in the two independent datasets (ADNI and DRC), and further reveals distinct
patterns of pathology in different diseases (tAD vs PCA) and for distinct types
of biomarker data: cortical thickness from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) vs
amyloid load from Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Finally, DIVE can be used
to estimate a fine-grained spatial distribution of pathology in the brain using
any kind of voxelwise or vertexwise measures including Jacobian compression
maps, fractional anisotropy (FA) maps from diffusion imaging or other PET
measures. DIVE source code is available online:

often a limiting factor for training deep neural networks. In contrast to
expensive manual labeling, computer simulations can generate large and fully
labeled data sets with a minimum of manual effort. However, models that are
trained on simulated data usually do not translate well to real scenarios. To
bridge the domain gap between simulated and real laparoscopic images, we
exploit recent advances in unpaired image-to-image translation. We extent an
image-to-image translation method to generate a diverse multitude of
realistically looking synthetic images based on images from a simple
laparoscopy simulation. By incorporating means to ensure that the image content
is preserved during the translation process, we ensure that the labels given
for the simulated images remain valid for their realistically looking
translations. This way, we are able to generate a large, fully labeled
synthetic data set of laparoscopic images with realistic appearance. We show
that this data set can be used to train models for the task of liver
segmentation of laparoscopic images. We achieve average dice scores of up to
0.89 in some patients without manually labeling a single laparoscopic image and
show that using our synthetic data to pre-train models can greatly improve
their performance. The synthetic data set will be made publicly available,
fully labeled with segmentation maps, depth maps, normal maps, and positions of
tools and camera (http://opencas.dkfz.de/image2image).

coherent frequency components, fully controlled through only two parameters:
the frequency separation between adjacent modes and the carrier offset
frequency. Providing a phase-coherent link between the optical and the
microwave/radio-frequency regions [2], FCs have become groundbreaking tools for
precision measurements[3,4].
  Despite these inherent advantages, developing miniaturized comb sources
across the whole infrared (IR), with an independent and simultaneous control of
the two comb degrees of freedom at a metrological level, has not been possible,
so far. Recently, promising results have been obtained with compact sources,
namely diode-laser-pumped microresonators [5,6] and quantum cascade lasers
(QCL-combs) [7,8]. While both these sources rely on four-wave mixing (FWM) to
generate comb frequency patterns, QCL-combs benefit from a mm-scale
miniaturized footprint, combined with an ad-hoc tailoring of the spectral
emission in the 3-250 {\mu}m range, by quantum engineering [9].
  Here, we demonstrate full stabilization and control of the two key parameters
of a QCL-comb against the primary frequency standard. Our technique, here
applied to a far-IR emitter and open ended to other spectral windows, enables
Hz-level narrowing of the individual comb modes, and metrological-grade tuning
of their individual frequencies, which are simultaneously measured with an
accuracy of 2x10^-12, limited by the frequency reference used. These
fully-controlled, frequency-scalable, ultra-compact comb emitters promise to
pervade an increasing number of mid- and far-IR applications, including quantum
technologies, due to the quantum nature of the gain media [10].

communications above clouds by extending the coverage of Air-to-Ground (A2G)
networks to oceanic and remote airspace via autonomous and self-configured
wireless networking amongst commercial passenger airplanes. The AANET concept
may be viewed as a new member of the family of Mobile ad hoc Networks (MANETs)
in action above the clouds. However, AANETs have more dynamic topologies,
larger and more variable geographical network size, stricter security
requirements and more hostile transmission conditions. These specific
characteristics lead to more grave challenges in aircraft mobility modeling,
aeronautical channel modeling and interference mitigation as well as in network
scheduling and routing. This paper provides an overview of AANET solutions by
characterizing the associated scenarios, requirements and challenges.
Explicitly, the research addressing the key techniques of AANETs, such as their
mobility models, network scheduling and routing, security and interference are
reviewed. Furthermore, we also identify the remaining challenges associated
with developing AANETs and present their prospective solutions as well as open
issues. The design framework of AANETs and the key technical issues are
investigated along with some recent research results. Furthermore, a range of
performance metrics optimized in designing AANETs and a number of
representative multi-objective optimization algorithms are outlined.

like GitHub, DBLP, Wikipedia, etc. Existing network similarity measures are
limited because they only consider similarity from the perspective of the query
node. However, due to the complicated topology of real-world networks, ignoring
the preferences of target nodes often results in odd or unintuitive
performance. In this work, we propose a dual perspective similarity metric
called Forward Backward Similarity (FBS) that efficiently computes topological
similarity from the perspective of both the query node and the perspective of
candidate nodes. The effectiveness of our method is evaluated by traditional
quantitative ranking metrics and large-scale human judgement on four large real
world networks. The proposed method matches human preference and outperforms
other similarity search algorithms on community overlap and link prediction.
Finally, we demonstrate top-5 rankings for five famous researchers on an
academic collaboration network to illustrate how our approach captures
semantics more intuitively than other approaches.

Segmentation (LDLS), a novel approach for 3-D point cloud segmentation, which
leverages 2-D segmentation of an RGB image from an aligned camera to avoid the
need for training on annotated 3-D data. We obtain 2-D segmentation predictions
by applying Mask-RCNN to the RGB image, and then link this image to a 3-D lidar
point cloud by building a graph of connections among 3-D points and 2-D pixels.
This graph then directs a semi-supervised label diffusion process, where the
2-D pixels act as source nodes that diffuse object label information through
the 3-D point cloud, resulting in a complete 3-D point cloud segmentation. We
conduct empirical studies on the KITTI benchmark dataset and on a mobile robot,
demonstrating wide applicability and superior performance of LDLS compared with
the previous state of the art in 3-D point cloud segmentation, without any need
for either 3-D training data or fine tuning of the 2-D image segmentation

in high-intensity accelerators is high enough that a single wayward pulse can
cause serious damage. Today's high-power targets operate at the limit of
available technology, and are designed for a very narrow range of beam
parameters. If the beam pulse is too far off centre, or if the beam size is not
correct, or if the beam density is too high, the target can be seriously
damaged. We will start with a brief introduction to high-power targets and then
move to a discussion of what can go wrong, and what are the risks. Next we will
discuss how to control the beam-related risk, followed by examples from a few
different accelerator facilities. We will finish with a detailed example of the
Oak Ridge Spallation Neutron Source target tune up and target protection.

of scientific research and industrial practice. Often the underlying mechanism
is highly complex, involving hidden evolving nonlinear dynamics and noise
contamination. When representative physical models and large labeled data sets
are unavailable, as is the case with most real-world applications,
model-dependent Bayesian approaches would yield misleading results, and most
supervised learning machines would also fail to reliably resolve the
intricately evolving systems. Here, we propose an unsupervised machine-learning
approach that operates in a well-constructed function space, whereby the
evolving nonlinear dynamics are captured through a linear functional
representation determined by the Koopman operator. This breakthrough leverages
on the time-feature embedding and the ensuing reconstruction of a phase-space
representation of the dynamics, thereby permitting the reliable identification
of critical global signatures from the whole trajectory. This dramatically
improves over commonly used static local features, which are vulnerable to
unknown transitions or noise. Thanks to its data-driven nature, our method
excludes any prior models and training corpus. We benchmark the astonishing
accuracy of our method on three diverse and challenging problems in: biology,
medicine, and engineering. In all cases, it outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods. As a new unsupervised information processing
paradigm, it is suitable for ubiquitous nonlinear dynamical systems or
end-users with little expertise, which permits an unbiased excavation of
underlying working principles or intrinsic correlations submerged in unlabeled

sufficient computational resources to ensure correct grammar recognition. A
widely-used approach to expand model capacity would be to couple an RNN to an
external memory stack. Here, we introduce a ""neural state"" pushdown automaton
(NSPDA), which consists of a digital stack, instead of an analog one, that is
coupled to a neural network state machine. We empirically show its
effectiveness in recognizing various context-free grammars (CFGs). First, we
develop the underlying mechanics of the proposed higher order recurrent network
and its manipulation of a stack as well as how to stably program its underlying
pushdown automaton (PDA) to achieve desired finite-state network dynamics.
Next, we introduce a noise regularization scheme for higher-order (tensor)
networks, to our knowledge the first of its kind, and design an algorithm for
improved incremental learning. Finally, we design a method for inserting
grammar rules into a NSPDA and empirically show that this prior knowledge
improves its training convergence time by an order of magnitude and, in some
cases, leads to better generalization. The NSPDA is also compared to a
classical analog stack neural network pushdown automaton (NNPDA) as well as a
wide array of first and second-order RNNs with and without external memory,
trained using different learning algorithms. Our results show that, for Dyck(2)
languages, prior rule-based knowledge is critical for optimization convergence
and for ensuring generalization to longer sequences at test time. We observe
that many RNNs with and without memory, but no prior knowledge, fail to
converge and generalize poorly on CFGs.

order to account for the many possible variations of data, we considered
artificial datasets with several tunable properties (number of classes,
separation between classes, etc). In addition, we also evaluated the
sensitivity of the clustering methods with regard to their parameters
configuration. The results revealed that, when considering the default
configurations of the adopted methods, the spectral approach usually
outperformed the other clustering algorithms. We also found that the default
configuration of the adopted implementations was not accurate. In these cases,
a simple approach based on random selection of parameters values proved to be a
good alternative to improve the performance. All in all, the reported approach

  Computer Architecture Letters",,,,cs.ET cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Neuromorphic hardware with non-volatile memory (NVM) can implement machine
learning workload in an energy-efficient manner. Unfortunately, certain NVMs
such as phase change memory (PCM) require high voltages for correct operation.
These voltages are supplied from an on-chip charge pump. If the charge pump is
activated too frequently, its internal CMOS devices do not recover from stress,
accelerating their aging and leading to negative bias temperature instability
(NBTI) generated defects. Forcefully discharging the stressed charge pump can
lower the aging rate of its CMOS devices, but makes the neuromorphic hardware
unavailable to perform computations while its charge pump is being discharged.
This negatively impacts performance such as latency and accuracy of the machine
learning workload being executed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
to exploit workload-specific performance and lifetime trade-offs in
neuromorphic computing. Our framework first extracts the precise times at which
a charge pump in the hardware is activated to support neural computations
within a workload. This timing information is then used with a characterized
NBTI reliability model to estimate the charge pump's aging during the workload
execution. We use our framework to evaluate workload-specific performance and
reliability impacts of using 1) different SNN mapping strategies and 2)
different charge pump discharge strategies. We show that our framework can be
used by system designers to explore performance and reliability trade-offs
early in the design of neuromorphic hardware such that appropriate
reliability-oriented design margins can be set.

gas densities were higher and gas-rich mergers were common. They can also form
inside lower-mass galaxies that have since been accreted and tidally disrupted,
leaving their globular cluster complement bound to higher-mass halos. We argue
that the age-metallicity-specific orbital energy relation in a galaxy's
globular cluster system can be used to identify its origin. Gas-rich mergers
should produce tightly bound systems in which metal-rich clusters are younger
than metal-poor clusters. Globular clusters formed in massive disks and then
scattered into a halo should have no relationship between age and specific
orbital energy. Accreted globular clusters should produce weakly bound systems
in which age and metallicity are correlated with each other but inversely
correlated with specific orbital energy. We use precise relative ages,
self-consistent metallicities, and space-based proper motion-informed orbits to
show that the Milky Way's metal-poor globular cluster system lies in a plane in
age-metallicity-specific orbital energy space. We find that relatively young or
metal-poor globular clusters are weakly bound to the Milky Way, while
relatively old or metal-rich globular clusters are tightly bound to the Galaxy.
While metal-rich globular clusters may be formed either in situ or ex situ, our
results suggest that metal-poor clusters formed outside of the Milky Way in
now-disrupted dwarf galaxies. We predict that this relationship between age,
metallicity, and specific orbital energy in a $L^{*}$ galaxy's globular cluster
system is a natural outcome of galaxy formation in a $\Lambda$CDM universe.

failing to estimate displacement correctly results in failure in generating
strain images. As conventional ultrasound elastography techniques suffer from
decorrelation noise, they are prone to fail in estimating displacement between
echo signals obtained during tissue distortions. This study proposes a novel
elastography technique which addresses the decorrelation in estimating
displacement field. We call our method GLUENet (GLobal Ultrasound Elastography
Network) which uses deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to get a coarse
time-delay estimation between two ultrasound images. This displacement is later
used for formulating a nonlinear cost function which incorporates similarity of
RF data intensity and prior information of estimated displacement. By
optimizing this cost function, we calculate the finer displacement by
exploiting all the information of all the samples of RF data simultaneously.
The Contrast to Noise Ratio (CNR) and Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of the strain
images from our technique is very much close to that of strain images from
GLUE. While most elastography algorithms are sensitive to parameter tuning, our
robust algorithm is substantially less sensitive to parameter tuning.

astronomically influenced prognoses for each day of the year. The best
preserved of these calendars is the Cairo Calendar (hereafter CC) dated to
1244--1163 B.C. We have presented evidence that the 2.85 days period in the
lucky prognoses of CC is equal to that of the eclipsing binary Algol during
this historical era. We wanted to find out the vocabulary that represents Algol
in the mythological texts of CC. Here we show that Algol was represented as
Horus and thus signified both divinity and kingship. The texts describing the
actions of Horus are consistent with the course of events witnessed by any
naked eye observer of Algol. These descriptions support our claim that CC is
the oldest preserved historical document of the discovery of a variable star.
The period of the Moon, 29.6 days, has also been discovered in CC. We show that
the actions of Seth were connected to this period, which also strongly
regulated the times described as lucky for Heaven and for Earth. Now, for the
first time, periodicity is discovered in the descriptions of the days in CC.
Unlike many previous attempts to uncover the reasoning behind the myths of
individual days, we discover the actual rules in the appearance and behaviour
of deities during the whole year.

extend the concept of evolving models of complex networks to hypernetworks. In
this work, we firstly propose a non-uniform hypernetwork model with
attractiveness, and obtain the stationary average hyperdegree distribution of
the non-uniform hypernetwork. Furthermore, we develop a model for weighted
hypernetworks that couples the establishment of new hyperedges and nodes and
the weights' dynamical evolution. We obtain the stationary average hyperdegree
and hyperstrength distribution by using the hyperdegree distribution of the
hypernetwork model with attractiveness, respectively. In particular, the model
yields a nontrivial time evolution of nodes' properties and scale-free behavior
for the hyperdegree and hyperstrength distribution. It is expected that our
work may give help to the study of the hypernetworks in real-world systems.

practical interest. A simple folklore algorithm can output a 2-approximation to
the diameter in linear time by running BFS from an arbitrary vertex. It has
been open whether a better approximation is possible in near-linear time. A
series of papers on fine-grained complexity have led to strong hardness results
for diameter in directed graphs, culminating in a recent tradeoff curve
independently discovered by [Li, STOC'21] and [Dalirrooyfard and Wein,
STOC'21], showing that under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH), for
any integer $k\ge 2$ and $\delta>0$, a $2-\frac{1}{k}-\delta$ approximation for
diameter in directed $m$-edge graphs requires $mn^{1+1/(k-1)-o(1)}$ time. In
particular, the simple linear time $2$-approximation algorithm is optimal for
directed graphs.
  In this paper we prove that the same tradeoff lower bound curve is possible
for undirected graphs as well, extending results of [Roditty and Vassilevska
W., STOC'13], [Li'20] and [Bonnet, ICALP'21] who proved the first few cases of
the curve, $k=2,3$ and $4$, respectively. Our result shows in particular that
the simple linear time $2$-approximation algorithm is also optimal for
undirected graphs. To obtain our result we develop new tools for fine-grained
reductions that could be useful for proving SETH-based hardness for other
problems in undirected graphs related to distance computation.

integration, and analysis. In addition to formally structured axioms,
ontologies contain meta-data in the form of annotation axioms which provide
valuable pieces of information that characterize ontology classes. Annotations
commonly used in ontologies include class labels, descriptions, or synonyms.
Despite being a rich source of semantic information, the ontology meta-data are
generally unexploited by ontology-based analysis methods such as semantic
similarity measures. Results: We propose a novel method, OPA2Vec, to generate
vector representations of biological entities in ontologies by combining formal
ontology axioms and annotation axioms from the ontology meta-data. We apply a
Word2Vec model that has been pre-trained on PubMed abstracts to produce feature
vectors from our collected data. We validate our method in two different ways:
first, we use the obtained vector representations of proteins as a similarity
measure to predict protein-protein interaction (PPI) on two different datasets.
Second, we evaluate our method on predicting gene-disease associations based on
phenotype similarity by generating vector representations of genes and diseases
using a phenotype ontology, and applying the obtained vectors to predict
gene-disease associations. These two experiments are just an illustration of
the possible applications of our method. OPA2Vec can be used to produce vector
representations of any biomedical entity given any type of biomedical ontology.

between two sequences for various tasks such as natural language inference,
paraphrasing and entailment. These aforementioned tasks are similar in nature,
yet they are often modeled individually. Knowledge transfer can be effective
for closely related tasks. However, transferring all knowledge, some of which
irrelevant for a target task, can lead to sub-optimal results due to
\textit{negative} transfer. Hence, this paper focuses on the transferability of
both instances and parameters across natural language understanding tasks by
proposing an ensemble-based transfer learning method. \newline The primary
contribution of this paper is the combination of both \textit{Dropout} and
\textit{Bagging} for improved transferability in neural networks, referred to
as \textit{Dropping} herein. We present a straightforward yet novel approach
for incorporating source \textit{Dropping} Networks to a target task for
few-shot learning that mitigates \textit{negative} transfer. This is achieved
by using a decaying parameter chosen according to the slope changes of a
smoothed spline error curve at sub-intervals during training. We compare the
proposed approach against hard parameter sharing and soft parameter sharing
transfer methods in the few-shot learning case. We also compare against models
that are fully trained on the target task in the standard supervised learning
setup. The aforementioned adjustment leads to improved transfer learning
performance and comparable results to the current state of the art only using a
fraction of the data from the target task.

numerical linear algebra, such as regression. In the overconstrained regression
problem, one is given an $n \times d$ matrix $A$, with $n \gg d$, as well as an
$n \times 1$ vector $b$, and one wants to find a vector $\hat{x}$ so as to
minimize the residual error $\|Ax-b\|_2$. Using the sketch and solve paradigm,
one first computes $S \cdot A$ and $S \cdot b$ for a randomly chosen matrix
$S$, then outputs $x' = (SA)^{\dagger} Sb$ so as to minimize $\|SAx' - Sb\|_2$.
  The sketch-and-solve paradigm gives a bound on $\|x'-x^*\|_2$ when $A$ is
well-conditioned. Our main result is that, when $S$ is the subsampled
randomized Fourier/Hadamard transform, the error $x' - x^*$ behaves as if it
lies in a ""random"" direction within this bound: for any fixed direction $a\in
\mathbb{R}^d$, we have with $1 - d^{-c}$ probability that
  \[
  \langle a, x'-x^*\rangle \lesssim
\frac{\|a\|_2\|x'-x^*\|_2}{d^{\frac{1}{2}-\gamma}}, \quad (1)
  \]
  where $c, \gamma > 0$ are arbitrary constants.
  This implies $\|x'-x^*\|_{\infty}$ is a factor $d^{\frac{1}{2}-\gamma}$
smaller than $\|x'-x^*\|_2$. It also gives a better bound on the generalization
of $x'$ to new examples: if rows of $A$ correspond to examples and columns to
features, then our result gives a better bound for the error introduced by
sketch-and-solve when classifying fresh examples. We show that not all
oblivious subspace embeddings $S$ satisfy these properties. In particular, we
give counterexamples showing that matrices based on Count-Sketch or leverage
score sampling do not satisfy these properties.
  We also provide lower bounds, both on how small $\|x'-x^*\|_2$ can be, and
for our new guarantee (1), showing that the subsampled randomized
Fourier/Hadamard transform is nearly optimal.

Together they generate figures-of-merit that are applicable to any time series

in the metric itself, utilize information across the whole time domain, and do
not require that the simulators use a common time grid. Here, a distance
measure is defined that can be used to compare the performance of each

from the distance measure that can be used to rank order the importance of fuel
cycle metrics. Lastly, this paper warns against using standard signal
processing techniques for error reduction. This is because it is found that
error reduction is better handled by the Gaussian process regression itself.

during their development as well as during the solar cycle. The departure of
the spectral indices of magnetic energy and current helicity from 5/3 are
analyzed, and it is found that it is lower than the spectral index of the
magnetic energy spectrum. Furthermore, the fractional magnetic helicity tends
to increase when the scale of the energy-carrying magnetic structures
increases. The magnetic helicity of NOAA 11515 violates the expected
hemispheric sign rule, which is interpreted as an effect of enhanced field
strengths at scales larger than 30-60Mm with opposite signs of helicity. This
is consistent with the general cycle dependence, which shows that around the

reinforcement learning to personalize instruction challenge levels and robot
feedback based on each user's unique learning patterns. We instantiated and
evaluated the approach in a study with 17 children with ASD, aged 3 to 7 years

that the fully autonomous SAR system was able to personalize its instruction

different temporal mRNA profiles due to differences in transcription time,
degradation rate and RNA processing kinetics. Recent studies have shown that a
splicing-associated RNA production delay can be significant. We introduce a
joint model of transcriptional activation and mRNA accumulation which can be
used for inference of transcription rate, RNA production delay and degradation
rate given genome-wide data from high-throughput sequencing time course
experiments. We combine a mechanistic differential equation model with a
non-parametric statistical modelling approach allowing us to capture a broad
range of activation kinetics, and use Bayesian parameter estimation to quantify
the uncertainty in the estimates of the kinetic parameters. We apply the model
to data from estrogen receptor (ER-{\alpha}) activation in the MCF-7 breast
cancer cell line. We use RNA polymerase II (pol-II) ChIP-Seq time course data
to characterise transcriptional activation and mRNA-Seq time course data to
quantify mature transcripts. We find that 11% of genes with a good signal in
the data display a delay of more than 20 minutes between completing
transcription and mature mRNA production. The genes displaying these long
delays are significantly more likely to be short. We also find a statistical
association between high delay and late intron retention in pre-mRNA data,
indicating significant splicing-associated production delays in many genes.

challenging for ASR systems, particularly when numeric sequences are not seen
during training. This out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issue is addressed in
conventional ASR systems by training part of the model on spoken domain
utterances (e.g. I need one dollar and twenty five cents.), for which numeric
sequences are composed of in-vocabulary numbers, and then using an FST
verbalizer to denormalize the result. Unfortunately, conventional ASR models
are not suitable for the low memory setting of on-device speech recognition.
E2E models such as RNN-T are attractive for on-device ASR, as they fold the AM,
PM and LM of a conventional model into one neural network. However, in the
on-device setting the large memory footprint of an FST denormer makes spoken
domain training more difficult. In this paper, we investigate techniques to
improve E2E model performance on numeric data. We find that using a
text-to-speech system to generate additional numeric training data, as well as
using a small-footprint neural network to perform spoken-to-written domain
denorming, yields improvement in several numeric classes. In the case of the
longest numeric sequences, we see reduction of WER by up to a factor of 8.

the elimination of less fit cells. Over the past decade, the phenomenon of cell
competition has been identified in many physiological and pathological
contexts, driven either by biochemical signaling or by mechanical forces within
the tissue. In both cases, competition has generally been characterized based
on the elimination of loser cells at the population level, but significantly
less attention has been focused on determining how single-cell dynamics and
interactions regulate population-wide changes. In this review, we describe
quantitative strategies and outline the outstanding challenges in understanding
the single cell rules governing tissue-scale competition dynamics. We propose
quantitative metrics to characterize single cell behaviors in competition and
use them to distinguish the types and outcomes of competition. We describe how
such metrics can be measured experimentally using a novel combination of
high-throughput imaging and machine learning algorithms. We outline the
experimental challenges to quantify cell fate dynamics with high-statistical
precision, and describe the utility of computational modeling in testing
hypotheses not easily accessible in experiments. In particular, cell-based
modeling approaches that combine mechanical interaction of cells with
decision-making rules for cell fate choices provide a powerful framework to

Specifically, a dynamic sampling strategy is used to sparsely sample
representative pixels and channels in the higher layer, forming adaptive
compact support for each pixel and channel in the lower layer. The sampled
features with high semantics are aggregated according to the affinities and
then propagated to detailed lower-layer features, leading to a fine-grained
segmentation result with well-preserved boundaries. Experiment results on both

environments as a team of players and keep track of the information known to
each individual player. This allows us to synthesize programs that interact
with a distributed environment and leverage multiple interacting sources of
information.
  The synthesis problem in distributed environments corresponds to solving a
special class of Petri games, i.e., multi-player games played over Petri nets,
where the net has a distinguished token representing the system and an
arbitrary number of tokens representing the environment. While, in general,
even the decidability of Petri games is an open question, we show that the
synthesis problem in distributed environments can be solved in polynomial time
for nets with up to two environment tokens. For an arbitrary but fixed number
of three or more environment tokens, the problem is NP-complete. If the number
of environment tokens grows with the size of the net, the problem is

with approximately $3\%$ of persistent radio sources exhibiting variability
which is largely AGN-related. In the faint (<mJy) flux density regime, it is
widely accepted that the radio source population begins to change from AGN
dominated to star-formation dominated, together with an emergent radio-quiet
AGN component. Very little is known about the variable source component in this
sub-mJy regime. In this paper, we provide the first insight into the $\mu$Jy
variable sky by performing a careful analysis using deep VLA data in the well
studied GOODS-N field. Using five epochs spread across 22 years, we investigate
approximately 480 radio sources finding 10 which show signs of variability. We
attribute this variability to the presence of an AGN in these systems. We
confirm and extend the results of previous surveys, finding that variability in
the faint radio sky is rather modest with only $\leq$2\% of sources exhibiting
significant variability between any two epochs. We find that 70\% of variable
sources show variability on timescales of a few days whilst on longer decadal
time-scales, the fraction of variable sources decreases to $<1\%$. This
suggests that the radio variability peaks on shorter timescales as suggested by
other studies. We find that 80\% of variable sources have VLBI counterparts,
and we use multi-wavelength data to infer that these may well be core-dominated
FR-I sources as postulated by wide-field VLBI surveys and semi-empirical
simulations.

linked to substantial property and infrastructural damage and are responsible
for the largest spatially aggregated financial losses. Such extreme winds are
typically generated by extratropical cyclone systems originating in the North
Atlantic and passing over Europe. Previous statistical studies tend to model
extreme winds at a given set of sites, corresponding to inference in a Eulerian
framework. Such inference cannot incorporate knowledge of the life cycle and
progression of extratropical cyclones across the region and is forced to make
restrictive assumptions about the extremal dependence structure. We take an
entirely different approach which overcomes these limitations by working in a
Lagrangian framework. Specifically, we model the development of windstorms over
time, preserving the physical characteristics linking the windstorm and the
cyclone track, the path of local vorticity maxima, and make a key finding that
the spatial extent of extratropical windstorms becomes more localised as its
magnitude increases irrespective of the location of the storm track. Our model
allows simulation of synthetic windstorm events to derive the joint
distributional features over any set of sites giving physically consistent
extrapolations to rarer events. From such simulations improved estimates of
this hazard can be achieved both in terms of intensity and area affected.

coinductive types. We wish to implement GDTT with decidable type-checking,

Martin-L\""of type theory in which the identity type is replaced by abstract
paths between terms. CTT provides a computational interpretation of functional
extensionality, is conjectured to have decidable type checking, and has an

theory, provides a computational interpretation of extensionality for guarded
recursive types. This further expands the foundations of CTT as a basis for
formalisation in mathematics and computer science. We present examples to

the slot number and measuring the signal level. The number of signal slots is
constant per one symbol when we use Pulse Position Modulation (PPM). If the
number of received signal slots per one symbol time is less than the
theoretical value, that means the threshold value is higher than the optimal
value. If it is more than the theoretical value, that means the threshold value
is lower. So, we can adjust the threshold value using the number of received
signal slots. At the second proposed method, the average received signal level
is not equal to the signal level because there is a ratio between the number of

average received signal level and the slot ratio. We show these performances as

inflation dynamics in this $f(\phi)T$ gravity (not to be confused with
torsion-scalar coupled theories) on a general basis and then apply it to three
well-motivated inflationary models. We find that the predictions for the
spectral tilt and the tensor-to-scalar ratio are sensitive to this new

into better agreement with data and allows a larger tensor-to-scalar ratio in

important factors affecting the performance of deep neural networks. Genetic
Algorithms (GA) have been used before to determine parameters of a network.
Yet, GAs perform a finite search over a discrete set of pre-defined candidates,
and cannot, in general, generate unseen configurations. In this paper, to move
from exploration to exploitation, we propose a novel and systematic method that
autonomously and simultaneously optimizes multiple parameters of any deep
neural network by using a GA aided by a bi-generative adversarial network
(Bi-GAN). The proposed Bi-GAN allows the autonomous exploitation and choice of
the number of neurons, for fully-connected layers, and number of filters, for
convolutional layers, from a large range of values. Our proposed Bi-GAN
involves two generators, and two different models compete and improve each
other progressively with a GAN-based strategy to optimize the networks during
GA evolution. Our proposed approach can be used to autonomously refine the
number of convolutional layers and dense layers, number and size of kernels,
and the number of neurons for the dense layers; choose the type of the
activation function; and decide whether to use dropout and batch normalization
or not, to improve the accuracy of different deep neural network architectures.
Without loss of generality, the proposed method has been tested with the
ModelNet database, and compared with the 3D Shapenets and two GA-only methods.
The results show that the presented approach can simultaneously and
successfully optimize multiple neural network parameters, and achieve higher
accuracy even with shallower networks.

and advocated for verifying the memory-safety property of computer programs. At
present, one of its biggest challenges is to effectively prove entailments
containing inductive heap predicates. These entailments are usually proof
obligations generated when verifying programs that manipulate complex data
structures like linked lists, trees, or graphs.
  To assist in proving such entailments, this paper introduces a lemma
synthesis framework, which automatically discovers lemmas to serve as eureka
steps in the proofs. Mathematical induction and template-based constraint
solving are two pillars of our framework. To derive the supporting lemmas for a
given entailment, the framework firstly identifies possible lemma templates
from the entailment's heap structure. It then sets up unknown relations among
each template's variables and conducts structural induction proof to generate
constraints about these relations. Finally, it solves the constraints to find
out actual definitions of the unknown relations, thus discovers the lemmas. We
have integrated this framework into a prototype prover and have experimented it
on various entailment benchmarks. The experimental results show that our
lemma-synthesis-assisted prover can prove many entailments that could not be
handled by existing techniques. This new proposal opens up more opportunities
to automatically reason with complex inductive heap predicates.

based on low- and high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. Methods. We
generated synthetic planetary atmosphere models and we compared them with the
transmission light curves and spectra observed in previous studies. Our models
account for the stellar limb-darkening and Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effects,
and contemplate various possible scenarios for the planetary atmosphere.
Results. We reconciled the discrepant results by identifying a range of
planetary atmospheres that are consistent with previous low- and
high-resolution spectroscopic observations. Either both datasets are
interpreted as consistent with a total absence of Na I in the planetary
atmosphere (with Hubble Space Telescope data being affected by limb darkening),
or the terminator temperature of HD209458 b has to have an upper limit of about
1000K. In particular, we find that 1D transmission spectra with
lower-than-equilibrium temperatures can also explain the previously reported
detection of absorption signal at low resolution due to differential transit
depth in adjacent bands, while the cores of the Na I D lines may be masked by
the strong RM signal seen at high resolution. We also rule out high-altitude
clouds, which would otherwise mask the absorption signal at low resolution, as
the source of the discrepancies. Conclusions. This work highlights the
synergies between different observing techniques, specifically low- and
high-resolution spectroscopy, to fully characterise transiting exoplanet
systems.

of the free final-time, successive linearization is performed iteratively for

each of problems becomes a convex problem, which can be solved effectively. An

an objective function and captures the communities of the network by optimizing
the objective function, and then, one uses various heuristics to solve the
optimization problem to extract the interesting communities for the user. In
this article, we demonstrate the procedure to transform a graph into points of
a metric space and develop the methods of community detection with the help of
a metric defined for a pair of points. We have also studied and analyzed the
community structure of the network therein. The results obtained with our

specifying the input: the input metric can be provided explicitly (as an $n

  - Implicit metric: For both problems, $O(1)$-approximation algorithms running

and $O(1)$-approximation algorithms running in $\tilde{O}(n/k)$ rounds in the

provide sufficient granularity to maintain appropriate performance without

various gatekeeping strategies have been developed in the literature, such as

non-intuitive or less flexible when addressing increasingly complex logical
relationships among families of hypotheses. In order to overcome the issue, in
this paper, we develop a new family-based graphical approach, which can easily
derive and visualize different gatekeeping strategies. In the proposed
approach, a directed and weighted graph is used to represent the generated
gatekeeping strategy where each node corresponds to a family of hypotheses and
two simple updating rules are used for updating the critical value of each
family and the transition coefficient between any two families. Theoretically,
we show that the proposed graphical approach strongly controls the overall
familywise error rate at a pre-specified level. Through some case studies and a
real clinical example, we demonstrate simplicity and flexibility of the

excessive network overhead. After identifying the main overhead origins, we
demonstrate that using QUIC as the SDN transport layer protocol significantly
reduces the overhead and improves the efficiency of the network. In this paper,
we introduce quicSDN to enable robust, low-overhead communication between the
controller and switches. We ran a variety of experiments to highlight quicSDN's
benefits, and compared experimental results with transport-layer overhead
prediction models. quicSDN's performance is evaluated in terms of network
overhead reduction and we also demonstrated quicSDN's connection migration
capabilities. First, we compare the differences in controller-switch
communication overhead between tcpSDN(SDN over TCP) and quicSDN. Overhead
reduction was measured in three scenarios: flow rule installation, queue
configuration, and flow rule statistics polling. Second, we compare the
connection migration of quicSDN and tcpSDN; QUIC's ability to quickly migrate
connections allows for reduced total traffic in comparison to TCP. Overall, our
results show that quicSDN outperformed tcpSDN in our SDN scenarios, and as
such, QUIC is a promising candidate as an SDN transport layer protocol in the

unlabeled data and a black-box access to the classification label. It does not
need classification confidences or access to the model's sensitive information
such as the training data set, the trigger set or the model parameters. The
white-box attack, proposes an efficient watermark removal when the parameters
of the marked model are available; our white-box attack does not require access
to the labeled data or the trigger set and improves the runtime of the
black-box attack up to seventeen times. We as well prove the security
inadequacy of the backdoor-based watermarking in keeping the watermark
undetectable by proposing an attack that detects whether a model contains a
watermark. Our attacks show that a recipient of a marked model can remove a
backdoor-based watermark with significantly less effort than training a new
model and some other techniques are needed to protect against re-distribution
by a motivated attacker.

question answering, from reading comprehension, semantic role labeling, and
even machine translation, to image and video understanding. With this
expansion, there are many differing views on the utility and definition of
""question answering"" itself. Some argue that its scope should be narrow, or
broad, or that it is overused in datasets today. In this opinion piece, we
argue that question answering should be considered a format which is sometimes
useful for studying particular phenomena, not a phenomenon or task in itself.
We discuss when a task is correctly described as question answering, and when a
task is usefully posed as question answering, instead of using some other
format.

these perturbations have on cross-matching, for matches between Gaia DR2 and
WISE stars in a crowded Galactic plane region. Applying the uncertainties as
quoted to Gaussian-based astrometric uncertainty functions (AUFs) can lead, in
dense Galactic fields, to only matching 55% of the counterparts. We describe
the construction of empirical descriptions for AUFs, building on the
cross-matching method of Wilson & Naylor (2018), utilising the magnitudes of
both catalogues to discriminate between true and false counterparts. We apply
the improved cross-matching method to the Galactic plane |b| < 10. We provide
the most likely counterpart matches and their respective probabilities. We also
analyse several cases to verify the robustness of the results, highlighting
some important caveats and considerations. Finally, we discuss the effect PSF
resolution has by comparing the intra-catalogue nearest neighbour separation
distributions of a sample of likely contaminated WISE objects and their
corresponding Spitzer counterpart. We show that some WISE contaminants are
resolved in Spitzer, with smaller intra-catalogue separations. We have
highlighted the effect contaminant stars have on WISE, but it is important for
all photometric catalogues, playing an important role in the next generation of

is obtained through an iterative quantization process, where the input data
belonging to different classes are clustered to the respective vertices of the
new feature space with maximum purity. In the new feature space, orthogonal
hyperplanes, which are employed at the split-nodes of decision trees in random
forests, can tackle the clustering problems effectively. We evaluated our
proposed method on public benchmark datasets for regression and classification
tasks, and experiments showed that JMPF remarkably outperforms other
state-of-the-art random-forest-based approaches. Furthermore, we applied JMPF
to image super-resolution, because the transformed, compact features are more
discriminative to the clustering-regression scheme. Experiment results on
several public benchmark datasets also showed that the JMPF-based image
super-resolution scheme is consistently superior to recent state-of-the-art

and smart transportation. If the direction angle of the desired received is
known, the desired channel gain vector is obtainable. Thus, in advance, the DM
transmitter knows the values of directional angles of desired user and
eavesdropper, or their direction of arrival (DOAs) because the beamforming
vector of confidential messages and artificial noise (AN) projection matrix is
mainly determined by directional angles of desired user and eavesdropper. For a
DM transceiver, working as a receiver, the first step is to measure the DOAs of
desired user and eavesdropper. Then, in the second step, using the measured
DOAs, the beamforming vector of confidential messages and AN projection matrix
is designed. In this paper, we describe the DOA measurement methods, power
allocation, and beamforming in DM networks. A machine learning-based DOA
measurement method is proposed to make a substantial SR performance gain
compared to single-snapshot measurement without machine learning for a given
null-space projection beamforming scheme. However, for a conventional DM
network, there still exists a serious secure issue: the eavesdropper moves
inside the main beam of the desired user and may intercept the confidential
messages intended to the desired users because the beamforming vector of
confidential messages and AN projection matrix are only angle-dependence. To
address this problem, we present a new concept of secure and precise

three-dimensional dependence by using DM, random frequency selection, and phase

correspond to a nominal cosmic-ray exposure age of ca. 0.1 Myr if produced in a
typical m-sized meteoroid. Such an atypically low nominal exposure age suggests
high shielding in a considerably larger body. In addition to the Xe-Q
composition, an excess of radiogenic 129Xe (from the decay of extinct 129I) is
observed (129Xe/132Xe = 1.18 +/- 0.03). Two N components are present, an
isotopically heavy component ({\delta}15N = +20 permil) released at low temp.
and a major light component ({\delta}15N = -110 permil) at higher temp. This
disequilibrium in N suggests that the diamonds in Hypatia were formed in space.
Our data are broadly consistent with concentrations and isotopic compositions
of noble gases in at least three different types of carbon-rich meteoritic
materials. However, Hypatia does not seem to be related to any of these
materials, but may have sampled a similar cosmochemical reservoir. Our study
does not confirm the presence of exotic noble gases that led Kramers et al. to
propose that Hypatia is a remnant of a comet that impacted the Earth.

architecture for dense image prediction. Particularly, we follow the
encoder-decoder style and focus on designing a connectivity structure for the
decoder. To achieve that, we design a densely connected network with learnable
connections, named Fully Dense Network, which contains a large set of possible
final connectivity structures. We then employ gradient descent to search the
optimal connectivity from the dense connections. The search process is guided
by a novel loss function, which pushes the weight of each connection to be
binary and the connections to be sparse. The discovered connectivity achieves
competitive results on two segmentation datasets, while runs more than three
times faster and requires less than half parameters compared to the
state-of-the-art methods. An extensive experiment shows that the discovered
connectivity is compatible with various backbones and generalizes well to other
dense image prediction tasks.

recognition focus on a set of predefined emotion classes, where the amount of
training data has the biggest impact on performance. However, in the standard
setting over-parameterised neural networks are not amenable for learning from
few samples as they can quickly over-fit. In addition, these approaches do not
have such a strong generalisation ability to identify a new category, where the
data of each category is too limited and significant variations exist in the
expression within the same semantic category. We embrace these challenges and
formulate the problem as a low-shot learning, where once the base classifier is
deployed, it must rapidly adapt to recognise novel classes using a few samples.
In this paper, we revisit and compare existing few-shot learning methods for
the low-shot facial expression recognition in terms of their generalisation
ability via episode-training. In particular, we extend our analysis on the
cross-domain generalisation, where training and test tasks are not drawn from
the same distribution. We demonstrate the efficacy of low-shot learning methods
through extensive experiments.

that divergences in word interpretations exist. We further apply the approach
to two well studied types of differences between people -- gender and region.
The detected words with divergent interpretations reveal the unique features of
specific groups of people. For gender, we discover that certain different
interests, social attitudes, and characters between males and females are
reflected in their divergent interpretations of many words. For region, we find
that specific interpretations of certain words reveal the geographical and

  Sets",,,,,math.PR stat.ME,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  This paper analyses a class of route choice models with closed-form
probability expressions, namely, Generalized Multivariate Extreme Value (GMEV)
models. A large group of these models emerge from different utility formulas
that combine systematic utility and random error terms. Twelve models are
captured in a single discrete choice framework. The additive utility formula
leads to the known logit family, being multinomial, path-size, paired
combinatorial and link-nested. For the multiplicative formulation only the
multinomial and path-size weibit models have been identified; this study also
identifies the paired combinatorial and link-nested variations, and generalizes
the path-size variant. Furthermore, a new traveller's decision rule based on
the multiplicative utility formula with a reference route is presented. Here
the traveller chooses exclusively based on the differences between routes. This
leads to four new GMEV models. We assess the models qualitatively based on a
generic structure of route utility with random foreseen travel times, for which
we empirically identify that the variance of utility should be different from
thus far assumed for multinomial probit and logit-kernel models. The expected
travellers' behaviour and model-behaviour under simple network changes are
analysed. Furthermore, all models are estimated and validated on an
illustrative network example with long distance and short distance
origin-destination pairs. The new multiplicative models based on differences
outperform the additive models in both tests.

relying on it to satisfy a broad range of information needs every day. Although
it is crucial to understand what exactly these needs are in order to be able to
meet them, little is currently known about why users visit Wikipedia. The goal
of this paper is to fill this gap by combining a survey of Wikipedia readers
with a log-based analysis of user activity. Based on an initial series of user
surveys, we build a taxonomy of Wikipedia use cases along several dimensions,
capturing users' motivations to visit Wikipedia, the depth of knowledge they
are seeking, and their knowledge of the topic of interest prior to visiting
Wikipedia. Then, we quantify the prevalence of these use cases via a
large-scale user survey conducted on live Wikipedia with almost 30,000
responses. Our analyses highlight the variety of factors driving users to
Wikipedia, such as current events, media coverage of a topic, personal
curiosity, work or school assignments, or boredom. Finally, we match survey
responses to the respondents' digital traces in Wikipedia's server logs,
enabling the discovery of behavioral patterns associated with specific use
cases. For instance, we observe long and fast-paced page sequences across
topics for users who are bored or exploring randomly, whereas those using
Wikipedia for work or school spend more time on individual articles focused on
topics such as science. Our findings advance our understanding of reader
motivations and behavior on Wikipedia and can have implications for developers
aiming to improve Wikipedia's user experience, editors striving to cater to
their readers' needs, third-party services (such as search engines) providing
access to Wikipedia content, and researchers aiming to build tools such as
recommendation engines.

advances in computation frameworks, connected vehicle technology, new
generation sensors, and artificial intelligence (AI). Particularly, the recent
advances performance of deep learning (DL) methods realized higher levels of
safety for autonomous vehicles and empowered volume imagery processing for
driving safety analysis. An important application of DL methods is extracting
driving safety metrics from traffic imagery. However, the majority of current
methods use safety metrics for micro-scale analysis of individual crash
incidents or near-crash events, which does not provide insightful guidelines
for the overall network-level traffic management. On the other hand,
large-scale safety assessment efforts mainly emphasize spatial and temporal
distributions of crashes, while not always revealing the safety violations that
cause crashes. To bridge these two perspectives, we define a new set of
network-level safety metrics for the overall safety assessment of traffic flow
by processing imagery taken by roadside infrastructure sensors. An integrative
analysis of the safety metrics and crash data reveals the insightful temporal
and spatial correlation between the representative network-level safety metrics
and the crash frequency. The analysis is performed using two video cameras in
the state of Arizona along with a 5-year crash report obtained from the Arizona
Department of Transportation. The results confirm that network-level safety
metrics can be used by the traffic management teams to equip traffic monitoring
systems with advanced AI-based risk analysis, and timely traffic flow control
decisions.

services, data privacy and security have become a critical challenge.
Conventionally, data is collected and aggregated in a data centre on which
machine learning models are trained. This centralised approach has induced
severe privacy risks to personal data leakage, misuse, and abuse. Furthermore,
in the era of the Internet of Things and big data in which data is essentially
distributed, transferring a vast amount of data to a data centre for processing
seems to be a cumbersome solution. This is not only because of the difficulties
in transferring and sharing data across data sources but also the challenges on
complying with rigorous data protection regulations and complicated
administrative procedures such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR). In this respect, Federated learning (FL) emerges as a prospective
solution that facilitates distributed collaborative learning without disclosing
original training data whilst naturally complying with the GDPR. Recent
research has demonstrated that retaining data and computation on-device in FL
is not sufficient enough for privacy-guarantee. This is because ML model
parameters exchanged between parties in an FL system still conceal sensitive
information, which can be exploited in some privacy attacks. Therefore, FL
systems shall be empowered by efficient privacy-preserving techniques to comply
with the GDPR. This article is dedicated to surveying on the state-of-the-art

quantum coherence and electron transport are not so well understood. In this
work, we investigate subpicosecond time scale quantum dynamics and electron
transfer in an efficient electron acceptor Rhodanine chromophoric complex. We
consider an open quantum system approach to model the complex-solvent
interaction and compute the crossover from weak to strong dissipation on the
reduced system dynamics for both a polar (Methanol) and a non-polar solvent
(Toluene). We show that the electron transfer rates are enhanced in the strong
chromophore-solvent coupling regime, being the highest transfer rates those
found at room temperature. Even though the computed dynamics are highly
non-Markovian, and they may exhibit a quantum character up to hundreds of
femtoseconds, we show that quantum coherence does not necessarily optimize the

the coupling to phonons is remarkable. Their photoluminescence exhibits
significant side band emission well separated from the zero phonon line (ZPL)

acoustic (LA) phonons also the coupling to local mode oscillations of the

studying the influence of the emitter's wave function dimensions on the phonon
side bands we find reasonable values for size of the wave function and the

demonstrate that the excitation of the emitters is most efficient by LO-phonon

tasks is the scarcity and cost of labeled training data. Active Learning (AL)
is one way of addressing this challenge. In stream-based AL, observations are
continuously made available to the learner that have to decide whether to
request a label or to make a prediction. The goal is to reduce the request rate
while at the same time maximize prediction performance. In previous research,
reinforcement learning has been used for learning the AL request/prediction
strategy. In our work, we propose to equip a reinforcement learning process
with memory augmented neural networks, to enhance the one-shot capabilities.
Moreover, we introduce Class Margin Sampling (CMS) as an extension of the
standard margin sampling to the reinforcement learning setting. This strategy
aims to reduce training time and improve sample efficiency in the training
process. We evaluate the proposed method on a classification task using

medium access methods, DSME and TSCH, were added to the IEEE 802.15.4 standard.
They allow collision-free communication in multi-hop networks and provide
channel hopping for mitigating external interferences. The slot schedule used
in these networks is of high importance for the network performance. This paper
supports the development of efficient schedules by providing an analytical
model for the assessment of such schedules, focused on TSCH. A Markov chain
model for the finite queue on every node is introduced that takes the slot
distribution into account. The models of all nodes are interconnected to
calculate network metrics such as packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay and

  Off-The-Shelf Approaches",,,,,cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Sentiment analysis has become a very important tool for analysis of social
media data. There are several methods developed for this research field, many
of them working very differently from each other, covering distinct aspects of
the problem and disparate strategies. Despite the large number of existent
techniques, there is no single one which fits well in all cases or for all data
sources. Supervised approaches may be able to adapt to specific situations but
they require manually labeled training, which is very cumbersome and expensive
to acquire, mainly for a new application. In this context, in here, we propose
to combine several very popular and effective state-of-the-practice sentiment
analysis methods, by means of an unsupervised bootstrapped strategy for
polarity classification. One of our main goals is to reduce the large
variability (lack of stability) of the unsupervised methods across different
domains (datasets). Our solution was thoroughly tested considering thirteen
different datasets in several domains such as opinions, comments, and social
media. The experimental results demonstrate that our combined method (aka,
10SENT) improves the effectiveness of the classification task, but more
importantly, it solves a key problem in the field. It is consistently among the
best methods in many data types, meaning that it can produce the best (or close
to best) results in almost all considered contexts, without any additional
costs (e.g., manual labeling). Our self-learning approach is also very
independent of the base methods, which means that it is highly extensible to
incorporate any new additional method that can be envisioned in the future.
Finally, we also investigate a transfer learning approach for sentiment
analysis as a means to gather additional (unsupervised) information for the
proposed approach and we show the potential of this technique to improve our
results.

as a different way from this approach, we conducted a study to classify ADHD by
selecting areas that are essential for using a deep learning model. For the
experiment, rsfMRI data provided by ADHD 200 global competition was used. To
obtain an integrated result from the multiple sites, each region of the brain
was evaluated with Leave one site out cross-validation. As a result, when we

H30$\alpha$ (231.90 GHz) emission from the low metallicity dwarf galaxy NGC
5253 to measure the star formation rate (SFR) within the galaxy and to test the
reliability of SFRs derived from other commonly-used metrics. The H30$\alpha$
emission, which originates mainly from the central starburst, yields a
photoionizing photon production rate of (1.9$\pm$0.3)$\times$10$^{52}$ s$^{-1}$
and an SFR of 0.087$\pm$0.013 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ based on conversions that
account for the low metallicity of the galaxy and for stellar rotation. Among
the other star formation metrics we examined, the SFR calculated from the total
infrared flux was statistically equivalent to the values from the H30$\alpha$
data. The SFR based on previously-published versions of the H$\alpha$ flux that
were extinction corrected using Pa$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$ lines were lower than
but also statistically similar to the H30$\alpha$ value. The mid-infrared (22
$\mu$m) flux density and the composite star formation tracer based on H$\alpha$
and mid-infrared emission give SFRs that were significantly higher because the
dust emission appears unusually hot compared to typical spiral galaxies.
Conversely, the 70 and 160 $\mu$m flux densities yielded SFR lower than the
H30$\alpha$ value, although the SFRs from the 70 $\mu$m and H30$\alpha$ data
were within 1-2$\sigma$ of each other. While further analysis on a broader
range of galaxies are needed, these results are instructive of the best and
worst methods to use when measuring SFR in low metallicity dwarf galaxies like

in high interaction rate causing the data acquisition rate to exceed 3 TB/sec.
In order to acquire data for all the events and to handle the increased data
rate, a transition in the readout electronics architecture from the triggered
to the trigger-less acquisition mode is required. In this new architecture, a
dedicated electronics block called the Common Readout Unit (CRU) is defined to
act as a nodal communication point for detector data aggregation and as a
distribution point for timing, trigger and control (TTC) information. TTC
information in the upgraded triggerless readout architecture uses two
asynchronous high-speed serial links connections: the TTC-PON and the GBT. We
have carried out a study to evaluate the quality of the embedded timing signals
forwarded by the CRU to the connected electronics using the TTC-PON and GBT

cleaning effect of the PLL on the timing signal, (c)BER analysis for
quantitative measurement of signal quality, and (d)the effect of optical

the design of probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS), which is a popular scheme
that relies on an amplitude shaper for increasing spectral efficiencies of
fiber-optic systems. One property of certain shapers used in PAS -- including
constant-composition distribution matchers -- that is often overlooked is that
a time-dependency between amplitudes is introduced. This dependency results in
symbols that are non-i.i.d., which have time-varying statistical properties.
Somewhat surprisingly, the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in PAS has
been shown to increase when the shaping blocklength decreases. This blocklength
dependency of SNR has been attributed to time-varying statistical properties of
the symbol sequences, in particular, to variation of the symbol energies. In
this paper, we investigate the temporal energy behavior of symbol sequences,
and introduce a new metric called energy dispersion index (EDI). EDI captures
the time-varying statistical properties of symbol energies. Numerical results

perform specific functionalities. We argue that the prevailing approach to
compose services based on the ""all or nothing"" paradigm is limiting and leads
to exceedingly high rejection of potentially suitable services. Furthermore,
contemporary models do not allow ""mix and match"" composition from atomic
services of different composite services when binary matching is not possible
or desired. In this paper, we propose a new model for service composition based
on ""stratified graph summarization"" and ""service stitching"". We discuss the
limitations of existing approaches with a motivating example, present our
approach to overcome these limitations, and outline a possible architecture for
service composition from atomic services. Our thesis is that, with the advent
of Big Data, our approach will reduce latency in service discovery, and will
improve efficiency and accuracy of matchmaking and composition of services.

Indo-European language pairs, where the languages share the same writing

the two different writing systems poses a major challenge because of a lack of

paper, we enable character-level NMT for Chinese, by breaking down Chinese
characters into linguistic units similar to that of Indo-European languages. We
use the Wubi encoding scheme, which preserves the original shape and semantic

  Pawan Kumar",Efficient Continuous Relaxations for Dense CRF,,,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Dense conditional random fields (CRF) with Gaussian pairwise potentials have
emerged as a popular framework for several computer vision applications such as
stereo correspondence and semantic segmentation. By modeling long-range
interactions, dense CRFs provide a more detailed labelling compared to their
sparse counterparts. Variational inference in these dense models is performed
using a filtering-based mean-field algorithm in order to obtain a
fully-factorized distribution minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence to the
true distribution. In contrast to the continuous relaxation-based energy
minimisation algorithms used for sparse CRFs, the mean-field algorithm fails to
provide strong theoretical guarantees on the quality of its solutions. To
address this deficiency, we show that it is possible to use the same filtering
approach to speed-up the optimisation of several continuous relaxations.
Specifically, we solve a convex quadratic programming (QP) relaxation using the
efficient Frank-Wolfe algorithm. This also allows us to solve
difference-of-convex relaxations via the iterative concave-convex procedure
where each iteration requires solving a convex QP. Finally, we develop a novel
divide-and-conquer method to compute the subgradients of a linear programming
relaxation that provides the best theoretical bounds for energy minimisation.
We demonstrate the advantage of continuous relaxations over the widely used
mean-field algorithm on publicly available datasets.

exploration of qualitatively distinct data regimes separated by phase
transitions. We show that inference quality depends strongly on the nature of
generative models: optimal accuracy occurs at an intermediate temperature where
the detrimental effects from macroscopic order and thermal noise are minimal.
Importantly our results indicate that DCA does not always outperform its
local-statistics-based predecessors; while DCA excels at low temperatures, it
becomes inferior to simple correlation thresholding at virtually all
temperatures when data are limited. Our findings offer new insights into the

gene family is a group of genes having evolved from a single ancestral gene. A
gene family evolves along the branches of a species tree through various
mechanisms, including - but not limited to - speciation, gene duplication, gene
loss, horizontal gene transfer. The reconstruction of a gene tree representing
the evolution of a gene family constrained by a species tree is an important
problem in phylogenomics. However, unlike in the multispecies coalescent
evolutionary model, very little is known about the search space for gene family
histories accounting for gene duplication, gene loss and horizontal gene
transfer (the DLT-model). We introduce the notion of evolutionary histories
defined as a binary ordered rooted tree describing the evolution of a gene
family, constrained by a species tree in the DLT-model. We provide formal
grammars describing the set of all evolutionary histories that are compatible
with a given species tree, whether it is ranked or unranked. These grammars
allow us, using either analytic combinatorics or dynamic programming, to
efficiently compute the number of histories of a given size, and also to
generate random histories of a given size under the uniform distribution. We
apply these tools to obtain exact asymptotics for the number of gene family
histories for two species trees, the rooted caterpillar and the complete binary
tree, as well as estimates of the range of the exponential growth factor of the
number of histories for random species trees of size up to 25. Our results show
that including horizontal gene transfer induce a dramatic increase of the
number of evolutionary histories. We also show that, within ranked species
trees, the number of evolutionary histories in the DLT-model is almost
independent of the species tree topology.

characterization of probabilistic bisimilarity in terms of two-player games,
which naturally reduces checking bisimilarity of probabilistic labelled
transition systems to checking bisimilarity of standard (non-deterministic)
labelled transition systems. This reduction can be easily implemented in the
framework of pPDA, allowing to use known results for standard
(non-probabilistic) PDA and their subclasses. A direct use of the reduction
incurs an exponential increase of complexity, which does not matter in deriving
decidability of bisimilarity for pPDA due to the non-elementary complexity of
the problem. In the cases of probabilistic one-counter automata (pOCA), of
probabilistic visibly pushdown automata (pvPDA), and of probabilistic basic
process algebras (i.e., single-state pPDA) we show that an implicit use of the
reduction can avoid the complexity increase; we thus get PSPACE, EXPTIME, and
2-EXPTIME upper bounds, respectively, like for the respective non-probabilistic
versions. The bisimilarity problems for OCA and vPDA are known to have matching

identifying components that are maximally correlated between repetitions (e.g.

setups and the wireless bandwidth becomes constrained. A safe and

to use for wireless access in such affected environments also provides
illumination. Importantly, when a Li-Fi unit is attached to an air balloon and
a network of such Li-Fi balloons are coordinated to form a Li-Fi balloon
network, data can be accessed anytime and anywhere required and hence many
lives can be tracked and saved. We propose this idea of a Li-Fi balloon and
give an overview of its design using the Philips Li-Fi hardware. Further, we
propose the concept of a balloon network and coin it with an acronym, the
LiBNet. We consider the balloons to be arranged as a homogeneous Poisson point
process in the LiBNet and we derive the mean co-channel interference for such
an arrangement.

activity are established by using the MAGNETOCOSMICS code, and the estimation
of the flux of secondaries at ground level is implemented by using the CORSIKA

a more realistic description of the atmospheric and geomagnetic response in
these complex regions of the rigidity space. As an example of our calculation

early evolutionary history of phototrophy is largely in the realm of the
unknown, the onset of oxygenic photosynthesis in primitive cyanobacteria
significantly altered the Earth's atmosphere by contributing to the rise of
oxygen ~2.3 billion years ago. However, photosynthetic chlorophyll and
bacteriochlorophyll pigments lack appreciable absorption at wavelengths about
500-600 nm, an energy-rich region of the solar spectrum. By contrast, simpler
retinal-based light-harvesting systems such as the haloarchaeal purple membrane
protein bacteriorhodopsin show a strong well-defined peak of absorbance
centered at 568 nm, which is complementary to that of chlorophyll pigments. We
propose a scenario where simple retinal-based light-harvesting systems like
that of the purple chromoprotein bacteriorhodopsin, originally discovered in
halophilic Archaea, may have dominated prior to the development of
photosynthesis. We explore this hypothesis, termed the 'Purple Earth,' and

positive support and negative support values to find similar temporal

that, it performs only a single scan of temporal database to find temporal
association patterns similar to specified reference support sequence. This

every graph with maximum average degree less than $\frac{2d+2}{d+2} k$ is
$k$-choosable with defect $d$. This improves upon a similar result by Havet and
Sereni [J. Graph Theory, 2006]. For clustered choosability of graphs with
maximum average degree $m$, no $(1-\epsilon)m$ bound on the number of colours
was previously known. The above result with $d=1$ solves this problem. It
implies that every graph with maximum average degree $m$ is
$\lfloor{\frac{3}{4}m+1}\rfloor$-choosable with clustering 2. This extends a
result of Kopreski and Yu [Discrete Math., 2017] to the setting of
choosability. We then prove two results about clustered choosability that
explore the trade-off between the number of colours and the clustering. In
particular, we prove that every graph with maximum average degree $m$ is
$\lfloor{\frac{7}{10}m+1}\rfloor$-choosable with clustering $9$, and is
$\lfloor{\frac{2}{3}m+1}\rfloor$-choosable with clustering $O(m)$. As an
example, the later result implies that every biplanar graph is 8-choosable with

reconnection and turbulence associated phenomena, require the simultaneous
signal sampling from arrays of magnetic sensors (hundreds or even thousands) to
obtain spatial resolution, with several hundred kHz for time resolution.
Magnetic measurements based on pick-up (Mirnov) coil are quite common in
experimental pulsed devices for plasma research, thanks to their simplicity and
reliability. Being the signal from this type of sensor proportional to the time
variation of the magnetic field ($dB/dt$), it has to be time-integrated to
recover the instant value of magnetic field. Depending on the required
integration time usually either analog integrators or chopped integrators are
used. However these solutions tend to limit the frequency bandwidth in the kHz
range, they are not easy to design and build, and require additional fast
channels to directly acquire the $dB/dt$ signal to recover the plasma dynamic
features at higher frequencies. In this paper we evaluate the feasibility of
using a direct single channel precision ADC to allow the simultaneous
acquisition of $dB/dt$ measurements and to provide the integrated B measurement
by means of digital integration on the new RFX-mod2 device. On this purpose we
interfaced an existing ADC-module to a Xilinx Zynq FPGA, in order to evaluate

in the superpositions of hyperspace vectors in classical physical
instantaneous-noise-based logic (INBL). We find both similarities with and
major differences from the related properties of quantum systems. Two search
algorithms utilizing the observed features are introduced. For the first one we
assume an unsorted names database set up by Alice that is a superposition
(unknown by Bob) of up to n=2^N strings; those we call names. Bob has access to
the superposition wave and to the 2N reference noises of the INBL system of N
noise bits. For Bob, to decide if a given name x is included in the
superposition, once the search has begun, it takes N switching operations
followed by a single measurement of the superposition wave. Thus the time and
hardware complexity of the search algorithm is O[log(n)] which indicates an
exponential speedup compared to Grover's quantum algorithm in a corresponding
setting. An extra advantage is that the error probability of the search is
zero. Moreover, the scheme can also check the existence of a fraction of a
string, or several separate string fractions embedded in an arbitrarily long,
arbitrary string. In the second algorithm, we expand the above scheme to a
phonebook with n names and s phone numbers. When the names and numbers have the

  Carcinoma in Histopathological Image",Accepted by MICCAI 2021,,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Histological subtype of papillary (p) renal cell carcinoma (RCC), type 1 vs.
type 2, is an essential prognostic factor. The two subtypes of pRCC have a
similar pattern, i.e., the papillary architecture, yet some subtle differences,
including cellular and cell-layer level patterns. However, the cellular and
cell-layer level patterns almost cannot be captured by existing CNN-based
models in large-size histopathological images, which brings obstacles to
directly applying these models to such a fine-grained classification task. This
paper proposes a novel instance-based Vision Transformer (i-ViT) to learn
robust representations of histopathological images for the pRCC subtyping task
by extracting finer features from instance patches (by cropping around
segmented nuclei and assigning predicted grades). The proposed i-ViT takes
top-K instances as input and aggregates them for capturing both the cellular
and cell-layer level patterns by a position-embedding layer, a grade-embedding
layer, and a multi-head multi-layer self-attention module. To evaluate the
performance of the proposed framework, experienced pathologists are invited to
selected 1162 regions of interest from 171 whole slide images of type 1 and
type 2 pRCC. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better
performance than existing CNN-based models with a significant margin.

network attracts lots of research interests. Many efforts have been put on the
optical properties of the nanoparticle networks and only a few investigations
on its light-induced thermal behavior was reported. We consider two-dimensional
(2D) square-lattice nanoparticle ensemble made of typical metal Ag with a
radius of 5 nm. The effect of complex optical coupling and thermal accumulation
on the light-induced thermal behavior in plasmonic resonance frequency (around
383 nm) is analyzed by means of the Green\textquotesingle s function approach.
Regime borders of both optical coupling and thermal accumulation effects on the
photothermal behavior of 2D square-lattice nanoparticle ensemble are figured
out clearly and quantitatively. A dimensionless parameter $\varphi$ is defined
as the ratio of full temperature increase to that without considering the
optical coupling or thermal accumulation to quantify the optical coupling and
thermal accumulation effects on photothermal behavior. The more compact the
nanoparticle ensemble is, the stronger the optical coupling on thermal behavior
is. When the lattice spacing increases to tens of nanoparticle radius, the
optical coupling becomes insignificant. When $\varphi \approx 1$ (lattice
spacing increases to hundreds of nanoparticle radius), the thermal accumulation
effects are weak and can be neglected safely. The polarization-dependent
distribution of temperature increase of nanoparticles is observed only in the
compact nanoparticle ensemble, while for dilute ensemble, such
polarization-dependent temperature increase distribution can not be observed
anymore. This work may help for the understanding of the light-induced thermal
transport in the 2D particle ensemble.

at assessing whether an existing deep learning network can rapidly generate sCT

A study was conducted on data of 91 patients with prostate, rectal and cervical
cancer who underwent external beam radiotherapy acquiring both CT and MRI for
patients' simulation. Dixon reconstructed water, fat and in-phase images
obtained from a conventional dual gradient-recalled echo sequence were used to
generate sCT images. A conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) was
trained in a paired fashion on 2D transverse slices of 32 prostate cancer
patients. The trained network was tested on the remaining patients to generate
sCT images. For 30 patients in the test set, dose recalculations of the
clinical plan were performed on sCT images. Dose distributions were evaluated
comparing voxel-based dose differences, gamma and dose-volume histogram (DVH)
analysis. The sCT generation required 5.6 s and 21 s for a single patient
volume on a GPU and CPU, respectively. On average, sCT images resulted in a
higher dose to the target of maximum 0.3%. Results suggest that accurate
MR-based dose calculation using sCT images generated with a cGAN trained on
prostate cancer patients is feasible for the entire pelvis. The sCT generation
was sufficiently fast to be integrated into an MR-guided radiotherapy workflow.

have been done in the past by two completely different approaches: (1.)
Nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolations, which use photospheric
vector magnetograms as boundary condition. (2.) Stereoscopy of coronal magnetic
loops observed in EUV coronal images from different vantage points. Both
approaches have their strength and weaknesses. Extrapolation methods are
sensitive to noise and inconsistencies in the boundary data and the accuracy of
stereoscopy is affected by the ability of identifying the same structure in
different images and by the separation angle between the view directions. As a
consequence, for the same observational data, the computed 3D coronal magnetic
field with the two methods do not necessarily coincide. In an earlier work
(Paper I) we extended our NLFFF optimization code by the inclusion of
stereoscopic constrains. The method was successfully tested with synthetic data
and within this work we apply the newly developed code to a combined data-set
from SDO/HMI, SDO/AIA and the two STEREO spacecraft. The extended method
(called S-NLFFF) contains an additional term that monitors and minimizes the
angle between the local magnetic field direction and the orientation of the 3D
coronal loops reconstructed by stereoscopy. We find that prescribing the shape
of the 3D stereoscopically reconstructed loops the S-NLFFF method leads to a
much better agreement between the modeled field and the stereoscopically
reconstructed loops. We also find an appreciable decrease by a factor of two in
the angle between the current and the magnetic field which indicates the
improved quality of the force-free solution obtained by S-NLFFF.

guided by an ordinary differential equation that is asymptotic-preserving at
the Navier-Stokes limit and ii) the shear stress is equal to the average shear
stress. Based on the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook model, the SIS is assessed to be
efficient and accurate. Then we investigate the Kramer's problem for gases
interacting through the inverse power-law, shielded Coulomb, and Lennard-Jones
potentials, subject to diffuse-specular and Cercignani-Lampis gas-surface
boundary conditions. When the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient
(TMAC) is not larger than one, the Knudsen layer function is strongly affected
by the potential, where its value and width increase with the effective
viscosity index of gas molecules. Moreover, the Knudsen layer function exhibits
similarities among different values of TMAC when the intermolecular potential

both the viscous slip coefficient and Knudsen layer function are affected by

nonthermal components were included. The flare was simultaneously observed by
many instruments. Methods. Using the fast Fourier transform (FFT), we
decomposed the light curves at multiple wavelengths into slowly varying and
rapidly varying signals. Then we identified the QPPs as the regular and
periodic peaks from the rapidly varying signals. The periods are derived with
the wavelet method and confirmed based on the FFT spectra of the rapidly
varying signals. Results. We find a period of 50 s from the thermal emissions
during the impulsive phase of the flare, that is, in the soft X-ray bands. At
the same time, a period of about 100 s is detected from the nonthermal
emissions, such as hard X-ray and microwave channels. The period ratio is
exactly 2.0, which might be due to the modulations of the magnetic reconnection
rate by the fundamental and harmonic modes of magnetohydrodynamic waves. Our
results further show that the 100 s period is present over a broad wavelength,
such as hard X-rays, extreme-UV/UV, and microwave emissions, indicating the
periodic magnetic reconnection in this flare. Conclusions. To our knowledge,
this is the first report about period changes from thermal to nonthermal
components in a single flare that occur at almost the same time. This new
observational finding could be a challenge to the theory of flare QPPs.

annotated with sentiments, their targets and holders, as well as polar terms
and their contextual modifiers. Using these data, I explore four major areas of
sentiment research: (i) generation of sentiment lexicons, (ii) fine-grained
opinion mining, (iii) message-level polarity classification, and (iv)
discourse-aware sentiment analysis. In the first task, I compare three popular
groups of lexicon generation methods: dictionary-, corpus-, and
word-embedding-based ones, finding that dictionary-based systems generally
yield better lexicons than the last two groups. Apart from this, I propose a
linear projection algorithm, whose results surpass many existing automatic
lexicons. Afterwords, in the second task, I examine two common approaches to
automatic prediction of sentiments, sources, and targets: conditional random
fields and recurrent neural networks, obtaining higher scores with the former
model and improving these results even further by redefining the structure of
CRF graphs. When dealing with message-level polarity classification, I
juxtapose three major sentiment paradigms: lexicon-, machine-learning-, and
deep-learning-based systems, and try to unite the first and last of these
groups by introducing a bidirectional neural network with lexicon-based
attention. Finally, in order to make the new classifier aware of discourse

important role in the performance of the system. Since the behaviour of
multidimensional constellations highly depends on the type of the channel, it
is crucial to employ a constellation that is suitable for a certain

indicators (KPIs) of multidimensional constellations that should be considered

on the known multidimensional constellations in the context of SCMA systems

that multidimensional constellations that satisfy KPIs of a certain channel

  Transactions of the Royal Society A",,,,cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.class-ph,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  This paper uses 3D grain-scale finite element (FE) simulations to appraise
the classical scattering theory of plane longitudinal wave propagation in
untextured polycrystals with statistically equiaxed grains belonging to the
seven crystal symmetries. As revealed from the results of 10,390 materials, the
classical theory has a linear relationship with the elastic scattering factor
at the quasi-static velocity limit, whereas the reference FE and
self-consistent (SC) results generally exhibit a quadratic relationship. As
supported by the results of 90 materials, such order difference also extends to
the attenuation and phase velocity, leading to larger differences between the
classical theory and the FE results for more strongly scattering materials.
Alternatively, two approximate models are proposed to achieve more accurate
calculations by including an additional quadratic term. One model uses
quadratic coefficients from quasi-static SC velocity fits and is thus
symmetry-specific, while the other uses theoretically-determined coefficients
and is valid for any individual material. These simple models generally deliver
more accurate attenuation and phase velocity (particularly the second model)
than the classical theory, especially for strongly scattering materials.
However, the models are invalid for the attenuation of materials with negative
quadratic coefficients.

culture and discovered near the Staropetrovsky village in the northeast of the
Donetsk region. The measurements and astronomical calculations revealed that
all signs have astronomical meaning. Fourray star has been interpreted as the
star Sirius. The sign polyline has been interpreted as an analog of graphic of
equation of time in which the testimony of a water clock correspond with
average solar time, and the testimony of a sundial - the true solar time. Sign
wheel has been interpreted as a complex of lines, reflecting the regularity
changing the direction of the shadows from the gnomon at sunset at the
equinoxes and solstices. The sign thin polyline has been interpreted as a
symbol of change of height of the Sun in the meridian at the equinoxes and
solstices. Interpretation of wheel and polyline is related to the definition of
the duration of the day. Sign of the wheel shows a direct relationship the
duration of the day on the magnitude of the azimuth of sunrise/sunset, and thin
polyline - from changing the height of the Sun in the meridian. Thus
Staropetrovsky vessel, thanks to the astronomical signs, is a kind of ancient

received wide attentions due to its good performances. However, when directly
applied to the hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, the recognition rate
is too low. This is because ELM does not use the spatial information which is
very important for HSI classification. In view of this, this paper proposes a
new framework for spectral-spatial classification of HSI by combining ELM with
loopy belief propagation (LBP). The original ELM is linear, and the nonlinear
ELMs (or Kernel ELMs) are the improvement of linear ELM (LELM). However, based
on lots of experiments and analysis, we found out that the LELM is a better
choice than nonlinear ELM for spectral-spatial classification of HSI.
Furthermore, we exploit the marginal probability distribution that uses the
whole information in the HSI and learn such distribution using the LBP. The
proposed method not only maintain the fast speed of ELM, but also greatly
improves the accuracy of classification. The experimental results in the
well-known HSI data sets, Indian Pines and Pavia University, demonstrate the
good performances of the proposed method.

resistive elements and the reactive power (Q) due to the inductive and
capacitive elements, which are commonly studied by using phasor and scalar
methods. Thus, this paper focuses on applying the fractal Julia sets to observe
the topological properties related to the signs and magnitudes of the real and
reactive powers consumed or supplied by an electrical circuit. To perform this,
different power combinations were used to represent the fractal diagrams with
an algorithm that considers the mathematical model of Julia sets. The study
considers three type of loads: the first study considers the change of real
power when the reactive power is fixed; the second study deals with the change
of the reactive power when the real power is fixed; and finally, the third
study contemplates that both real and reactive powers change. Furthermore, the
fractal diagrams of the power in the four quadrants of the complex plane are
studied to identify the topological properties that each sign and magnitude
represent. A qualitative analysis of the diagrams helps to identify that the
complex power loads present some fractal graphic patterns, with respect to the
signs and magnitudes considered in the different quadrants of the complex
planes. The diagrams represented in the complex planes save a relation in the
forms and structure with other points studied, concluding that the power is
related to other figures in other quadrants. Thus, this result allows a new
study of the behavior of the power in an electrical circuit, showing a clear
relation of the different fractal diagrams that the Julia sets obtained.

computational complexity theory and establish the natural measures for time and
space -- the number of beta-reductions and the size of the largest term in a
computation -- as reasonable measures with respect to the invariance thesis of
Slot and van Emde Boas [STOC~84]. More precisely, we show that, using those
measures, Turing machines and the weak call-by-value $\lambda$-calculus can
simulate each other within a polynomial overhead in time and a constant factor
overhead in space for all computations that terminate in (encodings) of 'true'
or 'false'. We consider this result as a solution to the long-standing open
problem, explicitly posed by Accattoli [ENTCS~18], of whether the natural
measures for time and space of the $\lambda$-calculus are reasonable, at least
in case of weak call-by-value evaluation.
  Our proof relies on a hybrid of two simulation strategies of reductions in
the weak call-by-value $\lambda$-calculus by Turing machines, both of which are
insufficient if taken alone. The first strategy is the most naive one in the
sense that a reduction sequence is simulated precisely as given by the
reduction rules; in particular, all substitutions are executed immediately.
This simulation runs within a constant overhead in space, but the overhead in
time might be exponential. The second strategy is heap-based and relies on
structure sharing, similar to existing compilers of eager functional languages.
This strategy only has a polynomial overhead in time, but the space consumption
might require an additional factor of $\log n$, which is essentially due to the
size of the pointers required for this strategy. Our main contribution is the
construction and verification of a space-aware interleaving of the two
strategies, which is shown to yield both a constant overhead in space and a
polynomial overhead in time.

probabilistic exponentially distributed time durations denoted by rates (the
parameter of the exponential distribution). Defining a semantics for such an
algebra, so to derive Continuous Time Markov Chains from system specifications,
requires dealing with transitions labeled by rates. With respect to standard
process algebra semantics this poses a problem: we have to take into account
the multiplicity of several identical transitions (with the same rate). Several
techniques addressing this problem have been introduced in the literature, but
they can only be used for semantic definitions that do not exploit a structural
congruence relation on terms while inferring transitions. On the other hand,
using a structural congruence relation is a useful mechanism that is commonly
adopted, for instance, in order to define semantics in reduction style for
non-basic process algebras such as the pi-calculus or richer ones. In this
paper we show how to define semantics for Markovian process algebra when
structural congruence is used while inferring transitions and, as an
application example, we define the reduction semantics for a stochastic version
of the pi-calculus. Moreover we show such semantics to be correct with respect
to the standard one (defined in labeled operational semantics style).

theory was a step in his program of Geometry of Interaction, the aim of which
being to account for the dynamics of logical proofs. In Ludics, objects called
designs keep only what is relevant for the cut elimination process, hence the
dynamics of a proof: a design is an abstraction of a formal proof. The notion
of behaviour is the counterpart in Ludics of the notion of type or the logical
notion of formula. Formally a behaviour is a closed set of designs. Our aim is
to explore the constructions of behaviours and to analyse their properties. In
this paper a design is viewed as a set of coherent paths. We recall or give
variants of properties concerning visitable paths, where a visitable path is a
path in a design or a set of designs that may be traversed by interaction with
a design of the orthogonal of the set. We are then able to answer the following
question: which properties should satisfy a set of paths for being exactly the
set of visitable paths of a behaviour? Such a set and its dual should be
prefix-closed, daimon-closed and satisfy two saturation properties. This allows
us to have a means for defining the whole set of visitable paths of a given set
of designs without closing it explicitly, that is without computing the
orthogonal of this set of designs. We finally apply all these results for
making explicit the structure of a behaviour generated by constants and
multiplicative/additive connectives. We end by proposing an oriented tensor for
which we give basic properties.

underlying a set of interactions between nodes. There is a vast literature on
the subject, but most known methods have an important drawback: the inferred
graph is not guaranteed to explain every interaction from the input trace. We
consider this an important issue since such inferred graph cannot be used as
input for applications that require a reliable estimate of the true graph. On
the other hand, a graph having trace feasibility guarantees can help us better
understand the true (hidden) interactions that may have taken place between
nodes of interest. The inference of such graph is the goal of this paper.
Firstly, given an activity log from a social network, we introduce a set of
constraints that take into consideration all the hidden paths that are possible
between the nodes of the trace, given their timestamps of interaction. Then, we
develop a nontrivial modification of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm by
Newman [1], that we call Constrained-EM, which incorporates the constraints and
a set of auxiliary variables into the inference process to guide it towards the
feasibility of the trace. Experimental results on real-world data from Twitter
confirm that Constrained-EM generates a posterior distribution of graphs that
explains all the events observed in the trace while presenting the desired
properties of a scale-free, small-world graph. Our method also outperforms
established methods in terms of feasibility and quality of the inferred graph.

a directional Gaussian preprocessing kernel and applying a 3D rotational matrix
to its covariance matrix. By weighing traces, or voxels, in the analysis cube
by their relative proximity to the reference trace or voxel, this approach
greatly enhances the clarity of the attribute. Furthermore, by making these
weights directional, the proposed attribute gives interpreters greater freedom
in exploring and understanding the seismic data. Various results from the
Netherlands North Sea F3 block show that this approach greatly enhances the
clarity of the coherence attribute and can highlight structures that are not
visible using the traditional C3, or GTC coherence.

accelerated and rotating circular cylinder from rest in a stationary, viscous,
incompressible and micropolar fluid. This flow problem is examined numerically
by adopting a special scheme comprising the Adams-Bashforth Temporal Fourier
Series method and the Runge-Kutta Temporal Special Finite-Difference method.
This numerical scheme transforms the governing equation for micropolar fluids
for this problem into system of finite-difference equations. This system was
further solved numerically by point SOR-method. These results were also further
extrapolated by the Richardson extrapolation method. This scheme is valid for
all values of the flow and fluid-parameters and for all time. Moreover the
boundary conditions of the vorticity and the spin at points far from the
cylinder are being imposed and encountered too. The results are compared with
existing results (for non-rotating circular cylinder in Newtonian fluids). The
comparison is good. The enhancement of lift and reduction in drag was observed
if the micropolarity effects are intensified. Same is happened if the rotation
of a cylinder increases. Furthermore, the vortex-pair in the wake is delayed to
successively higher times as rotation parameter increases. In addition, the
rotation helps not only in dissolving vortices adjacent to the cylinder and
adverse pressure region but also in dissolving the boundary layer separation.
Furthermore, the rotation reduces the micropolar spin boundary layer also.

problem is and to choose the appropriate background knowledge according to the
context. For instance, presented with the string ""8/17/2017"" to be transformed
to ""17th of August of 2017"", humans will process this in two steps: (1) they
recognise that it is a date and (2) they map the date to the 17th of August of
2017. Inductive Programming (IP) aims at learning declarative (functional or
logic) programs from examples. Two key advantages of IP are the use of
background knowledge and the ability to synthesise programs from a few
input/output examples (as humans do). In this paper we propose to use IP as a
means for automating repetitive data manipulation tasks, frequently presented
during the process of {\em data wrangling} in many data manipulation problems.
Here we show that with the use of general-purpose declarative (programming)
languages jointly with generic IP systems and the definition of domain-specific
knowledge, many specific data wrangling problems from different application
domains can be automatically solved from very few examples. We also propose an
integrated benchmark for data wrangling, which we share publicly for the

new developments result in an efficiency of 68% for the correct identification
of a b jet for a probability of 1% of misidentifying a light-flavour jet. The
improvement in relative efficiency at this misidentification probability is
about 15%, compared to previous CMS algorithms. In addition, for the first time

sample recorded in 2016 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV has also allowed
the development of new methods to measure the efficiency and misidentification

additionally use the redundant information on their energy ($\textit{E}$) to
enhance the contrast between groupings. For this endeavour, we use
$\textit{Gaia}$ EDR3 based measurements of $170$ globular clusters, $41$
streams and $46$ satellites to derive their $\mathbf{J}$ and $\textit{E}$. To
detect groups, we use the $\texttt{ENLINK}$ software, coupled with a
statistical procedure that accounts for the observed phase-space uncertainties
of these objects. We detect a total of $N=6$ groups, including the previously
known mergers $\textit{Sagittarius}$, $\textit{Cetus}$,
$\textit{Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus}$, $\textit{LMS-1/Wukong}$,
$\textit{Arjuna/Sequoia/I'itoi}$ and one new merger that we call

expression in space and time is a central topic in biology. To activate a gene,
a TF has first to diffuse in the available space of the nucleus until it
reaches a target DNA sequence or protein (target site). This eventually results
in the recruitment of the whole transcriptional machinery.
  All these processes take place in the mammalian nucleoplasm, a highly
organized and dynamic environment, in which some complexes transiently assemble
and break apart, whereas others appear more stable. This diversity of dynamic
behaviors arises from the number of biomolecules that make up the nucleoplasm
and their pairwise interactions. Indeed, interactions energies that span
several orders of magnitude, from covalent bounds to transient and dynamic
interactions can shape nuclear landscapes. Thus, the nuclear environment
determines how frequently and how fast a TF contacts its target site, and
indirectly gene expression. How exactly transient interactions are involved in
the regulation of TF diffusion is unclear, but are reflected by live cell
imaging techniques such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, fluorescence
recovery after photobleaching or single-particle tracking. Overall, the
macroscopic result of these microscopic interactions is almost always anomalous
diffusion, a phenomenon widely studied and modeled.
  Here, we review the connections between the anomalous diffusion of a TF and
the microscopic organization of the nucleus, including recently described
topologically associated domains and dynamic phase-separated compartments. We
propose that anomalous diffusion found in single particle tracking (SPT) data
result from weak and transient interactions with dynamic nuclear substructures,
and that SPT data analysis would benefit form a better description of such
structures.

between an informed agent (the sender) and uninformed decision makers (the
receivers). The current rapidly-growing literature mostly assumes a dichotomy:
either the sender is powerful enough to communicate separately with each
receiver (a.k.a. private persuasion), or she cannot communicate separately at
all (a.k.a. public persuasion). We study a model that smoothly interpolates
between the two, by considering a natural multi-channel communication structure
in which each receiver observes a subset of the sender's communication
channels. This captures, e.g., receivers on a network, where information
spillover is almost inevitable.
  We completely characterize when one communication structure is better for the
sender than another, in the sense of yielding higher optimal expected utility
universally over all prior distributions and utility functions. The
characterization is based on a simple pairwise relation among receivers - one
receiver information-dominates another if he observes at least the same
channels. We prove that a communication structure $M_1$ is (weakly) better than
$M_2$ if and only if every information-dominating pair of receivers in $M_1$ is
also such in $M_2$. We also provide an additive FPTAS for the optimal sender's
signaling scheme when the number of states is constant and the graph of
information-dominating pairs is a directed forest. Finally, we prove that
finding an optimal signaling scheme under multi-channel persuasion is,
generally, computationally harder than under both public and private
persuasion.

explicitly taking into account the stance that decision-makers take towards
arguments and counter-arguments. To that end, we elaborate a formal framework
aiming to integrate the role of arguments and argumentation in decision theory
and decision aid. We start from a decision situation, where an individual
requests decision support. In this context, we formally define, as a
commendable basis for decision-aid, this individual's deliberated judgment,
popularized by Rawls. We explain how models of deliberated judgment can be
validated empirically. We then identify conditions upon which the existence of
a valid model can be taken for granted, and analyze how these conditions can be
relaxed. We then explore the significance of our proposed framework for
decision aiding practice. We argue that our concept of deliberated judgment
owes its normative credentials both to its normative foundations (the idea of
rationality based on arguments) and to its reference to empirical reality (the
stance that real, empirical individuals hold towards arguments and
counter-arguments, on due reflection). We then highlight that our framework
opens promising avenues for future research involving both philosophical and
decision theoretic approaches, as well as empirical implementations.

Ulyanov et al. bridge the gap between these two families of methods (CVPR 18).

allows various network structures by modifying the following network
components: skip links, cascading of the network input into intermediate
layers, a composition of the encoder-decoder subnetworks, and network depth.
These handcrafted network structures illustrate how the construction of
untrained networks influence the following image restoration tasks: denoising,
super-resolution, and inpainting. We also demonstrate image reconstruction
using flash and no-flash image pairs. We provide performance comparisons with

2011.14271,Fankun Bu,"Fankun Bu, Kaveh Dehghanpour, Zhaoyu Wang",Enriching Load Data Using Micro-PMUs and Smart Meters,,,,,eess.SP,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  In modern distribution systems, load uncertainty can be fully captured by
micro-PMUs, which can record high-resolution data; however, in practice,
micro-PMUs are installed at limited locations in distribution networks due to
budgetary constraints. In contrast, smart meters are widely deployed but can
only measure relatively low-resolution energy consumption, which cannot
sufficiently reflect the actual instantaneous load volatility within each
sampling interval. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach for
enriching load data for service transformers that only have low-resolution
smart meters. The key to our approach is to statistically recover the
high-resolution load data, which is masked by the low-resolution data, using
trained probabilistic models of service transformers that have both high and
low-resolution data sources, i.e, micro-PMUs and smart meters. The overall
framework consists of two steps: first, for the transformers with micro-PMUs, a
Gaussian Process is leveraged to capture the relationship between the
maximum/minimum load and average load within each low-resolution sampling
interval of smart meters; a Markov chain model is employed to characterize the
transition probability of known high-resolution load. Next, the trained models
are used as teachers for the transformers with only smart meters to decompose
known low-resolution load data into targeted high-resolution load data. The
enriched data can recover instantaneous load uncertainty and significantly
enhance distribution system observability and situational awareness. We have
verified the proposed approach using real high- and low-resolution load data.

network, where a full-duplex multi-antenna relay assists transmission from a

transmits to a cognitive near user. Our objective is to enlarge the far-near
user rate region by maximizing the rate of the near user under a constraint
that the rate of the far user is above a certain threshold. To this end, a
non-convex joint optimization problem of relay beamforming and the transmit
powers at the BS and cognitive relay is solved as a semi-definite relaxation
problem, in conjunction with an efficiently solvable line-search approach. For
comparisons, we also consider low complexity fixed beamformer design, where the
optimum power allocation between the BS and cognitive relay is solved. Our
results demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization can significantly
reduce the impact of the residual self-interference at the FD relay and
inter-user interference in the near user case.

systems, were recently detected by the near-infrared Vista Variables in the Via
Lactea (VVV) survey. We present an exploratory near-infrared spectroscopic
variability study of 14 eruptive YSOs. The variations were sampled over 1-day
and 1 to 2-year intervals and analysed in combination with VVV light curves. CO
overtone absorption features are observed on 3 objects with FUor-like spectra:
all show deeper absorption when they are brighter. This implies stronger
emission from the circumstellar disc with a steeper vertical temperature
gradient when the accretion rate is higher. This confirms the nature of fast
VVV FUor-like events, in line with the accepted picture for classical FUors.
The absence of Br$\gamma$ emission in a FUor-like object declining to
pre-outburst brightness suggests that reconstruction of the stellar magnetic
field is a slow process. Within the 1-day timescale, 60% of H$_2$-emitting YSOs
show significant but modest variation, and 2/6 sources have large variations in
Br$\gamma$. Over year-long timescales, H$_2$ flux variations remain modest
despite up to 1.8 mag variation in $K_s$. This indicates that emission from the
molecular outflow usually arises further from the protostar and is unaffected
by relatively large changes in accretion rate on year-long timescales. Two
objects show signs of on/off magnetospheric accretion traced by Br$\gamma$
emission. In addition, a 60% inter-night brightening of the H$_2$ outflow is
detected in one YSO.

each integer as a variable length sequence of bytes. The low 7 bits of each
byte encode a portion of the integer, and the high bit of each byte is reserved
as a continuation flag. This flag is set to 1 for all bytes except the last,
and the decoding of each integer is complete when a byte with a high bit of 0
is encountered. VByte decoding can be a performance bottleneck especially when
the unpredictable lengths of the encoded integers cause frequent branch
mispredictions. Previous attempts to accelerate VByte decoding using SIMD
vector instructions have been disappointing, prodding search engines such as
Google to use more complicated but faster-to-decode formats for
performance-critical code. Our decoder (Masked VByte) is 2 to 4 times faster
than a conventional scalar VByte decoder, making the format once again
competitive with regard to speed.

functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion weighted imaging
(DWI) data, with the heteroscedastic Rician regression model as a prominent
special case. The model allows both parameters in the NC-$\chi$ distribution to
be linked to explanatory variables, with the relevant covariates automatically
chosen by Bayesian variable selection. A highly efficient Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is proposed for simulating from the joint Bayesian
posterior distribution of all model parameters and the binary covariate
selection indicators. Simulated fMRI data is used to demonstrate that the
Rician model is able to localize brain activity much more accurately than the
traditionally used Gaussian model at low signal-to-noise ratios. Using a
diffusion dataset from the Human Connectome Project, it is also shown that the
commonly used approximate Gaussian noise model underestimates the mean
diffusivity (MD) and the fractional anisotropy (FA) in the single-diffusion
tensor model compared to the theoretically correct Rician model.

unique hues. We propose a hierarchical model inspired by the neuronal
mechanisms in the brain for local hue representation, which reveals the
contributions of each visual cortical area in hue representation. Local hue
encoding is achieved through incrementally increasing processing nonlinearities
beginning with cone input. Besides employing nonlinear rectifications, we
propose multiplicative modulations as a form of nonlinearity. Our simulation
results indicate that multiplicative modulations have significant contributions
in encoding of hues along intermediate directions in the MacLeod-Boynton
diagram and that model V4 neurons have the capacity to encode unique hues.
Additionally, responses of our model neurons resemble those of biological color
cells, suggesting that our model provides a novel formulation of the brain's
color processing pathway.

further generalize this framework to model sentence pairs, where a

selection, and paraphrase identification, our proposed model, a modified CNN

numerical simulations to investigate performance of l_1-norm and
total-variation (TV) minimization under various imaging conditions. From 36,100
different simulated structures, our results show specimens with more complex

However, once sufficient data is acquired, dividing the beam dose over more
projections provides no improvements - analogous to the traditional
