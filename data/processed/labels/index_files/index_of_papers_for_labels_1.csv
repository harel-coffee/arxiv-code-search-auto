improvements. However, there are still problems existing in the predictions,
such as blurry boundary and inaccurate location, which is mainly caused by
inadequate feature extraction and integration. In this paper, we propose a
Multi-scale Edge-based U-shape Network (MEUN) to integrate various features at
different scales to achieve better performance. To extract more useful
information for boundary prediction, U-shape Edge Network modules are embedded
in each decoder units. Besides, the additional down-sampling module alleviates
the location inaccuracy. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets
demonstrate the validity and reliability of the proposed method. Multi-scale
Edge based U-shape Network also shows its superiority when compared with 15
state-of-the-art salient object detection methods.

Atari-like games, Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep-RL) techniques for motion
control have been qualitatively enhanced. Nowadays, modern Deep-RL can be
successfully applied to solve a wide range of complex decision-making tasks for
many types of vehicles. Based on this context, in this paper, we propose the
use of Deep-RL to perform autonomous mapless navigation for Hybrid Unmanned
Aerial Underwater Vehicles (HUAUVs), robots that can operate in both, air or
water media. We developed two approaches, one deterministic and the other
stochastic. Our system uses the relative localization of the vehicle and simple
sparse range data to train the network. We compared our approaches with a
traditional geometric tracking controller for mapless navigation. Based on
experimental results, we can conclude that Deep-RL-based approaches can be
successfully used to perform mapless navigation and obstacle avoidance for
HUAUVs. Our vehicle accomplished the navigation in two scenarios, being capable
to achieve the desired target through both environments, and even outperforming
the geometric-based tracking controller on the obstacle-avoidance capability.

services, data privacy and security have become a critical challenge.
Conventionally, data is collected and aggregated in a data centre on which
machine learning models are trained. This centralised approach has induced
severe privacy risks to personal data leakage, misuse, and abuse. Furthermore,
in the era of the Internet of Things and big data in which data is essentially
distributed, transferring a vast amount of data to a data centre for processing
seems to be a cumbersome solution. This is not only because of the difficulties
in transferring and sharing data across data sources but also the challenges on
complying with rigorous data protection regulations and complicated
administrative procedures such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR). In this respect, Federated learning (FL) emerges as a prospective
solution that facilitates distributed collaborative learning without disclosing
original training data whilst naturally complying with the GDPR. Recent
research has demonstrated that retaining data and computation on-device in FL
is not sufficient enough for privacy-guarantee. This is because ML model
parameters exchanged between parties in an FL system still conceal sensitive
information, which can be exploited in some privacy attacks. Therefore, FL
systems shall be empowered by efficient privacy-preserving techniques to comply
with the GDPR. This article is dedicated to surveying on the state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving techniques which can be employed in FL in a systematic
fashion, as well as how these techniques mitigate data security and privacy
risks. Furthermore, we provide insights into the challenges along with
prospective approaches following the GDPR regulatory guidelines that an FL
system shall implement to comply with the GDPR.

2010.09647,Alexey Radul,Alexey Radul and Boris Alexeev,The Base Measure Problem and its Solution,,,,,cs.PL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Probabilistic programming systems generally compute with probability density
functions, leaving the base measure of each such function implicit. This mostly
works, but creates problems when densities with respect to different base
measures are accidentally combined or compared. Mistakes also happen when
computing volume corrections for continuous changes of variables, which in
general depend on the support measure. We motivate and clarify the problem in
the context of a composable library of probability distributions and bijective
transformations. We solve the problem by standardizing on Hausdorff measure as
a base, and deriving formulas for comparing and combining mixed-dimension
densities, as well as updating densities with respect to Hausdorff measure
under diffeomorphic transformations. We also propose a software architecture
that implements these formulas efficiently in the common case. We hope that by
adopting our solution, probabilistic programming systems can become more robust
and general, and make a broader class of models accessible to practitioners.

application-level caching to continue satisfying users' demands, and improve
the scalability and availability of origin servers. Despite its popularity,
this level of caching involves the manual implementation by developers and is
typically addressed in an ad-hoc way, given that it depends on specific details
of the application. As a result, application-level caching is a time-consuming
and error-prone task, becoming a common source of bugs. Furthermore, it forces
application developers to reason about a crosscutting concern, which is
unrelated to the application business logic. In this paper, we present the
results of a qualitative study of how developers handle caching logic in their
web applications, which involved the investigation of ten software projects
with different characteristics. The study we designed is based on comparative
and interactive principles of grounded theory, and the analysis of our data
allowed us to extract and understand how developers address cache-related
concerns to improve performance and scalability of their web applications.
Based on our analysis, we derived guidelines and patterns, which guide
developers while designing, implementing and maintaining application-level
caching, thus supporting developers in this challenging task that is crucial
for enterprise web applications.

RGB images. This guarantees that as the input image of a hand is rotated the
generated mesh undergoes a corresponding rotation. Furthermore, this removes
undesirable deformations in the meshes often generated by methods without
rotation equivariance. By building a rotation equivariant model, through
considering symmetries in the problem, we reduce the need for training on very

  The encoder takes images defined on $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ and maps these to latent
functions defined on the group $C_{8}$. We introduce a novel vector mapping
function to map the function defined on $C_{8}$ to a latent point cloud space

mimic interaction behaviors between a system under test and the target system.
With service virtualisation, the development team can get access to the

frequent and comprehensive testing. Previous techniques for service
virtualisation have relied on explicitly modelling the target services by a
service expert and require detailed knowledge of message protocol and
structure. However, neither of these are necessarily available.
  In this thesis, we introduce our novel opaque response generation approach.
This approach enables services to be virtualised automatically without any
expert knowledge or documentation of system protocol and interaction
behaviours. Given a collection of interactions exchanged between a system under
test and a target real service, our approach can 1) organise the same type of
interactions into the same cluster and derive a cluster prototype for each
cluster; 2) search a given incoming request for its the most similar request in
the interaction library; 3) learn knowledge from the incoming request and the
recorded interaction; and 4) generate a response. A framework and

further generate more challenging training samples and force the model to keep
predicting discriminative representation on these hard samples. In this paper,
we propose MixSiam, a mixture-based approach upon the traditional siamese

element-wise maximum of two features. On the other hand, we take the mixture of
these augmented images as input, and expect the model prediction to be close to
the discriminative representation. In this way, the model could access more
variant data samples of an instance and keep predicting invariant
discriminative representations for them. Thus the learned model is more robust

across domains could include differing dynamics, viewpoint, or morphology; we
present a novel framework to learn correspondences across such domains.
Importantly, in contrast to prior works, we use unpaired and unaligned
trajectories containing only states in the expert domain, to learn this
correspondence. We utilize a cycle-consistency constraint on both the state
space and a domain agnostic latent space to do this. In addition, we enforce
consistency on the temporal position of states via a normalized position
estimator function, to align the trajectories across the two domains. Once this
correspondence is found, we can directly transfer the demonstrations on one
domain to the other and use it for imitation. Experiments across a wide variety
of challenging domains demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

physical layer security (PLS) in single-input single-output (SISO) systems
using orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and artificial noise
(AN) signal injection. The AN signal does not corrupt the data transmission to
the legitimate receiver but degrades the decoding performance of the
eavesdropper. This scheme guarantees the secrecy of a communication towards a
legitimate user when the transmitter knows the instantaneous channel state
information (CSI) of the legitimate link thanks to the channel reciprocity in
time division duplex (TDD) systems, but does not know the instantaneous CSI of
a potential eavesdropper. Three optimal decoding structures at the eavesdropper
are considered in a fast fading (FF) environment depending on the handshake
procedure between Alice and Bob. Closed-form approximations of the AN energy to
inject in order to maximize the SR of the communication are derived. In
addition, the required conditions at the legitimate receiver's end to guarantee
a given SR are determined when Eve's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is infinite.
Furthermore, a waterfilling power allocation strategy is presented to further
enhance the secrecy of the scheme. Simulation results are presented to
demonstrate the security performance of the proposed secure system.

radiation dose should remain at a low level to reduce the health risks.
Therefore, there is an increasing need for algorithms that can reconstruct
high-quality images from low-dose scans. In this regard, most of the recent
studies have focused on iterative reconstruction algorithms, and little
attention has been paid to restoration of the projection measurements, i.e.,
the sinogram. In this paper, we propose a novel sinogram interpolation
algorithm. The proposed algorithm exploits the self-similarity and smoothness
of the sinogram. Sinogram self-similarity is modeled in terms of the similarity
of small blocks extracted from stacked projections. The smoothness is modeled
via second-order total variation. Experiments with simulated and real CT data
show that sinogram interpolation with the proposed algorithm leads to a
substantial improvement in the quality of the reconstructed image, especially
on low-dose scans. The proposed method can result in a significant reduction in
the number of projection measurements. This will reduce the radiation dose and
also the amount of data that need to be stored or transmitted, if the
reconstruction is to be performed in a remote site.

coordinate caregiving resources, and meet unmet needs through access to
resources. Currently, older adults use consumer technologies to support
everyday life, however these technologies are not always accessible or as
useful as they can be. Indeed, industry has attempted to create smart home
technologies with older adults as a target user group, however these solutions
are often more focused on the technical aspects and are short lived. In this
paper, we advocate for older adults being involved in the design process - from
initial ideation to product development to deployment. We encourage federally
funded researchers and industry to create compensated, diverse older adult
advisory boards to address stereotypes about aging while ensuring their needs
are considered.
  We envision artificial intelligence systems that augment resources instead of
replacing them - especially in under-resourced communities. Older adults rely
on their caregiver networks and community organizations for social, emotional,
and physical support; thus, AI should be used to coordinate resources better
and lower the burden of connecting with these resources. Although
sociotechnical smart systems can help identify needs of older adults, the lack
of affordable research infrastructure and translation of findings into consumer
technology perpetuates inequities in designing for diverse older adults. In
addition, there is a disconnect between the creation of smart sensing systems
and creating understandable, actionable data for older adults and caregivers to
utilize. We ultimately advocate for a well-coordinated research effort across
the United States that connects older adults, caregivers, community
organizations, and researchers together to catalyze innovative and practical
research for all stakeholders.

increasing penetration of single-phase distributed generation and single-phase
loads such as electric vehicle chargers. Unbalance mitigation will be a
significant concern as voltage unbalance leads to increased losses, reduced
motor and inverter efficiency, and becomes a limiting factor for DN operation.
The true definition of the unbalance metric needs phasor measurements of
network voltage and current. However, such phasor measurements are generally
not available in real life and as such approximate definitions are widely used
due to their simplicity. This work aims to compare the true voltage unbalance
definition and approximate unbalance metrics derived from phase voltage
magnitude, as phase voltage magnitudes are commonly measured by digital
metering infrastructure. For the comparison, multi-period power flow
simulations are performed for 161 Spanish distribution feeders with R/X ratios
varying from 2.87 to 14.68. We observe that phase magnitude-based unbalance
metrics reasonably approximate the true unbalance for higher R/X ratios with a
varying load power factor in a DN. Furthermore, the approximate unbalance
metrics slightly improve for a low DN power factor due to the increase in DN
unbalance. Therefore, the phase magnitude-based unbalance metric can be
utilized for approximating DN unbalance.

for reliable and low-latency wireless communication for applications such as
vehicle-to-vehicle communication and industrial automation. The environment
that these applications operate in is often highly dynamic, and, as a result,
the wireless network technology used needs to be able to adapt to changing
conditions, which makes mesh networking a good fit. Hence, in this work, we
consider Thread and Bluetooth Mesh, two prominent mesh networking technologies.
We measure one-way point-to-point latency using these technologies and show the
cumulative probability distribution of the latency for varying payload size. We
carry out the measurements under static conditions in an open-air environment.
Our results show that Thread achieves lower latency than Bluetooth Mesh,
especially for larger payloads. Furthermore, we show that Thread meets some of
the latency targets set out for 5G. However, since Thread networks are slow to
adapt to network changes, Thread may still not be suitable for application
requiring low latency. Bluetooth mesh, on the other hand, does not meet any of
the latency targets, although it is close when the payload is small (less than

  This work proposes Jujutsu, a technique to detect and mitigate robust and

attacks' universal property - Jujutsu first locates the region of the potential
adversarial patch, and then strategically transfers it to a dedicated region in
a new image to determine whether it is truly malicious. For attack mitigation,
Jujutsu leverages the attacks' localized nature via image inpainting to
synthesize the semantic contents in the pixels that are corrupted by the
attacks, and reconstruct the ``clean'' image.

capturing the manifold structure of target objects, and accordingly boosts the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. However, most existing methods encode
the location information in an implicit way, e.g. the distance transform maps,
which describe the relative distance from each pixel to the contour boundary,
for the network to learn. These implicit approaches do not fully exploit the
position information (i.e. absolute location) of targets. In this paper, we
propose a novel loss function, namely residual moment (RM) loss, to explicitly
embed the location information of segmentation targets during the training of
deep learning networks. Particularly, motivated by image moments, the
segmentation prediction map and ground-truth map are weighted by coordinate
information. Then our RM loss encourages the networks to maintain the
consistency between the two weighted maps, which promotes the segmentation
networks to easily locate the targets and extract manifold-structure-related
features. We validate the proposed RM loss by conducting extensive experiments
on two publicly available datasets, i.e., 2D optic cup and disk segmentation
and 3D left atrial segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our RM loss, which significantly boosts the accuracy of
segmentation networks.

setting, we approximate a class of GP priors through prior sampling and
subsequent fitting of a variational autoencoder (VAE). Given a trained VAE, the
resultant decoder allows spatiotemporal inference to become incredibly
efficient due to the low dimensional, independently distributed latent Gaussian
space representation of the VAE. Once trained, inference using the VAE decoder
replaces the GP within a Bayesian sampling framework. This approach provides
tractable and easy-to-implement means of approximately encoding spatiotemporal

A foundation for this methodology is the availability of realistic workflow
instances. Dozens of workflow instances for a few scientific applications are
available in public repositories. While these are invaluable, they are limited:
workflow instances are not available for all application scales of interest. To
address this limitation, previous work has developed generators of synthetic,
but representative, workflow instances of arbitrary scales. These generators
are popular, but implementing them is a manual, labor-intensive process that
requires expert application knowledge. As a result, these generators only
target a handful of applications, even though hundreds of applications use
workflows in production.

Based on an input set of workflow instances, WfChef automatically produces a

compare the realism of the workflows generated by WfChef generators to that of
the workflows generated by the previously available, hand-crafted generators.

plane-wave discretization of Kohn-Sham equations. However the presence of
Coulomb singularities requires the use of large plane-wave cut-offs to produce
accurate numerical results. In this paper, an analysis of the plane-wave
convergence of the eigenvalues of periodic linear Hamiltonians with Coulomb
potentials using the variational projector-augmented wave (VPAW) method is
presented. In the VPAW method, an invertible transformation is applied to the
original eigenvalue problem, acting locally in balls centered at the
singularities. In this setting, a generalized eigenvalue problem needs to be
solved using plane-waves. We show that cusps of the eigenfunctions of the VPAW
eigenvalue problem at the positions of the nuclei are significantly reduced.
These eigenfunctions have however a higher-order derivative discontinuity at
the spheres centered at the nuclei. By balancing both sources of error, we show
that the VPAW method can drastically improve the plane-wave convergence of the
eigenvalues with a minor additional computational cost. Numerical tests are

information flow, differential privacy, and cost analysis. In order to achieve
the best results, these systems often use relational refinements and relational
effects to maximally exploit the similarity in the structure of the two
programs being compared. Relational type systems are appealing for relational
properties because they deliver simpler and more precise verification than what
could be derived from typing the two programs separately. However, relational
type systems do not yet achieve the practical appeal of their non-relational
counterpart, in part because of the lack of a general foundations for
implementing them.
  In this paper, we take a step in this direction by developing bidirectional
relational type checking for systems with relational refinements and effects.
Our approach achieves the benefits of bidirectional type checking, in a
relational setting. In particular, it significantly reduces the need for typing
annotations through the combination of type checking and type inference. In
order to highlight the foundational nature of our approach, we develop
bidirectional versions of several relational type systems which incrementally
combine many different components needed for expressive relational analysis.

  priors",,,,,stat.ML cs.LG stat.ME,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  In this work we introduce a computational efficient data-driven framework
suitable for quantifying the uncertainty in physical parameters of computer
models, represented by differential equations. We construct physics-informed
priors for differential equations, which are multi-output Gaussian process (GP)
priors that encode the model's structure in the covariance function. We extend
this into a fully Bayesian framework which allows quantifying the uncertainty
of physical parameters and model predictions. Since physical models are usually
imperfect descriptions of the real process, we allow the model to deviate from
the observed data by considering a discrepancy function. For inference
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling is used. This work is motivated by the
need for interpretable parameters for the hemodynamics of the heart for
personal treatment of hypertension. The model used is the arterial Windkessel
model, which represents the hemodynamics of the heart through differential
equations with physically interpretable parameters of medical interest. As most
physical models, the Windkessel model is an imperfect description of the real
process. To demonstrate our approach we simulate noisy data from a more complex
physical model with known mathematical connections to our modeling choice. We
show that without accounting for discrepancy, the posterior of the physical
parameters deviates from the true value while when accounting for discrepancy
gives reasonable quantification of physical parameters uncertainty and reduces
the uncertainty in subsequent model predictions.

pre-training Vision Transformers (ViT) for natural image analysis. By
performing the pretext task of reconstructing the original image from only
partial observations, the encoder, which is a ViT, is encouraged to aggregate
contextual information to infer content in masked image regions. We believe
that this context aggregation ability is also essential to the medical image
domain where each anatomical structure is functionally and mechanically
connected to other structures and regions. However, there is no ImageNet-scale
medical image dataset for pre-training. Thus, in this paper, we investigate a
self pre-training paradigm with MAE for medical images, i.e., models are
pre-trained on the same target dataset. To validate the MAE self pre-training,
we consider three diverse medical image tasks including chest X-ray disease
classification, CT abdomen multi-organ segmentation and MRI brain tumor
segmentation. It turns out MAE self pre-training benefits all the tasks
markedly. Specifically, the mAUC on lung disease classification is increased by
9.4%. The average DSC on brain tumor segmentation is improved from 77.4% to
78.9%. Most interestingly, on the small-scale multi-organ segmentation dataset
(N=30), the average DSC improves from 78.8% to 83.5% and the HD95 is reduced by
60%, indicating its effectiveness in limited data scenarios. The segmentation

  Swarm Optimization with Gaussian Mutation",,,,,cs.CV cs.NE cs.RO,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Human activity discovery aims to distinguish the activities performed by
humans, without any prior information of what defines each activity. Most
methods presented in human activity recognition are supervised, where there are
labeled inputs to train the system. In reality, it is difficult to label data
because of its huge volume and the variety of activities performed by humans.
In this paper, a novel unsupervised approach is proposed to perform human
activity discovery in 3D skeleton sequences. First, important frames are
selected based on kinetic energy. Next, the displacement of joints, set of
statistical, angles, and orientation features are extracted to represent the
activities information. Since not all extracted features have useful
information, the dimension of features is reduced using PCA. Most human
activity discovery proposed are not fully unsupervised. They use pre-segmented
videos before categorizing activities. To deal with this, we used the
fragmented sliding time window method to segment the time series of activities
with some overlapping. Then, activities are discovered by a novel hybrid
particle swarm optimization with a Gaussian mutation algorithm to avoid getting
stuck in the local optimum. Finally, k-means is applied to the outcome
centroids to overcome the slow rate of PSO. Experiments on three datasets have
been presented and the results show the proposed method has superior
performance in discovering activities in all evaluation parameters compared to
the other state-of-the-art methods and has increased accuracy of at least 4 %
on average. The code is available here:

derive the variational principle for 2-D parametric magnetostatic problems, and
prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution that satisfies the equations
of the governing physics, i.e., Maxwell's equations. We use a deep neural
network (DNN) to represent the magnetic field as a function of space and a
total of ten parameters that describe geometric features and operating point
conditions. We train the DNN by minimizing the physics-informed loss function

systematic numerical studies using a parametric EI-core electromagnet problem.
In these studies, we vary the DNN architecture trying more than one hundred
different possibilities. For each study, we evaluate the accuracy of the DNN by
comparing its predictions to those of finite element analysis. In an exhaustive
non-parametric study, we observe that sufficiently parameterized dense networks
result in relative errors of less than 1%. Residual connections always improve
relative errors for the same number of training iterations. Also, we observe
that Fourier encoding features aligned with the device geometry do improve the
rate of convergence, albeit higher-order harmonics are not necessary. Finally,

critical for autonomous vehicles and robot navigation. Most calibration methods
rely on hand-crafted features and require significant amounts of extracted
features or specific calibration targets. With the development of deep learning
(DL) techniques, some attempts take advantage of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) to regress the 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) extrinsic parameters.
Nevertheless, the performance of these DL-based methods is reported to be worse
than the non-DL methods. This paper proposed an online LiDAR-camera extrinsic
calibration algorithm that combines the DL and the geometry methods. We define
a two-channel image named calibration flow to illustrate the deviation from the
initial projection to the ground truth. EPnP algorithm within the RANdom SAmple
Consensus (RANSAC) scheme is applied to estimate the extrinsic parameters with
2D-3D correspondences constructed by the calibration flow. Experiments on KITTI

challenging task in music information retrieval. While other piano-related
tasks, such as pitch estimation and onset detection, have seen improvement
through applying deep learning methods, little work has been done to develop
deep learning models to detect playing techniques. In this paper, we propose a
transfer learning approach for the detection of sustain-pedal techniques, which
are commonly used by pianists to enrich the sound. In the source task, a
convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained for learning spectral and
temporal contexts when the sustain pedal is pressed using a large dataset
generated by a physical modelling virtual instrument. The CNN is designed and
experimented through exploiting the knowledge of piano acoustics and physics.
This can achieve an accuracy score of 0.98 in the validation results. In the
target task, the knowledge learned from the synthesised data can be transferred
to detect the sustain pedal in acoustic piano recordings. A concatenated
feature vector using the activations of the trained convolutional layers is
extracted from the recordings and classified into frame-wise pedal press or
release. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in acoustic piano
recordings of Chopin's music. From the cross-validation results, the proposed
transfer learning method achieves an average F-measure of 0.89 and an overall
performance of 0.84 obtained using the micro-averaged F-measure. These results
outperform applying the pre-trained CNN model directly or the model with a
fine-tuned last layer.

(instead of a kinematic model) in the Kalman filter can lead to more accurate
predictions, as the dynamic model takes the forces acting on the AUV into
account. Presented in this paper is a motion-predictive extended Kalman filter
(EKF) for AUVs using a simplified dynamic model. The dynamic model is derived
first and then it was simplified for a RexROV, a type of submarine vehicle used
in simple underwater exploration, inspection of subsea structures, pipelines
and shipwrecks. The filter was implemented with a simulated vehicle in an
open-source marine vehicle simulator called UUV Simulator and the results were

on real-time. Some perspective and discussion on practical implementation is

leakage satisfies DP in the presence of updates. To the best of our knowledge,
there are no existing systems that have these properties. We demonstrate
Incshrink's practical feasibility in terms of efficiency and accuracy with

accurately, it is well known that the attention of the network may not always
be on the semantically important regions of the scene. It has been observed
that networks often learn background textures which are not relevant to the
object of interest. In turn this makes the networks susceptible to variations
and changes in the background which negatively affect their performance. We
propose a new two-step training procedure called split training to reduce this
bias in CNNs on both Infrared imagery and RGB data. Our split training
procedure has two steps: using MSE loss first train the layers of the network
on images with background to match the activations of the same network when it
is trained using images without background; then with these layers frozen,
train the rest of the network with cross-entropy loss to classify the objects.
Our training method outperforms the traditional training procedure in both a
simple CNN architecture, and deep CNNs like VGG and Densenet which use lots of
hardware resources, and learns to mimic human vision which focuses more on
shape and structure than background with higher accuracy.

deployment of robotics or augmented reality applications in any environments,
especially those for which no accurate 3D model nor huge amount of ground truth
data are available. It exploits the ability of deep learning techniques to
reliably detect objects regardless of viewing conditions. Previous works have
also shown that abstracting the geometry of a scene of objects by an ellipsoid
cloud allows to compute the camera pose accurately enough for various
application needs. Though promising, these approaches use the ellipses fitted
to the detection bounding boxes as an approximation of the imaged objects. In
this paper, we go one step further and propose a learning-based method which
detects improved elliptic approximations of objects which are coherent with the
3D ellipsoids in terms of perspective projection. Experiments prove that the
accuracy of the computed pose significantly increases thanks to our method.

series of papers on fine-grained complexity have led to strong hardness results
for diameter in directed graphs, culminating in a recent tradeoff curve
independently discovered by [Li, STOC'21] and [Dalirrooyfard and Wein,

coupled information for LF image processing. Specifically, we first design a
class of domain-specific convolutions to disentangle LFs from different
dimensions, and then leverage these disentangled features by designing
task-specific modules. Our disentangling mechanism can well incorporate the LF
structure prior and effectively handle 4D LF data. Based on the proposed
mechanism, we develop three networks (i.e., DistgSSR, DistgASR and DistgDisp)
for spatial super-resolution, angular super-resolution and disparity

Newer versions of ARM (ARMv8 and later), Alpha, and Intel's x-86 support MCA.
Our tests reveal that state-of-the-art dynamic verification techniques that
analyze program executions under the C11 memory model generate safety property
violations that can be interpreted as false alarms under MCA semantics. Sorting
the true from false violations puts an undesirable burden on the user. In this

in the past decade. Machine learning algorithms have been utilized extensively
for this application as they provide a valuable second opinion to the doctors.
Despite several machine learning models being available for medical imaging
applications, not many have been implemented in the real-world due to the
uninterpretable nature of the decisions made by the network. In this paper, we
investigate the results provided by deep neural networks for the detection of
malaria, diabetic retinopathy, brain tumor, and tuberculosis in different
imaging modalities. We visualize the class activation mappings for all the
applications in order to enhance the understanding of these networks. This type
of visualization, along with the corresponding network performance metrics,
would aid the data science experts in better understanding of their models as
well as assisting doctors in their decision-making process.

strawberry shipments across the continental United States. Three pallets were
instrumented in each shipment with three vertically placed loggers to take a
longitudinal and latitudinal snapshot of 9 strategically different locations
(including the top, middle and bottom layers of the pallets placed in the back,
middle and the front of the shipping container) for a combined 54 measurement
points across shipments of varying lengths. The sensors were instrumented in
the field, right at the point of harvest, recorded temperatures every every 5
to 10 minutes depending on the shipment, and uploaded their data periodically
via cellular radios on each device. The data is a result of significant
collaboration between stakeholders from farmers to distributors to retailers to
academics, which can play an important role for researchers and educators in
food engineering, cold-chain, machine learning, and data mining, as well as in
other disciplines related to food and transportation.

the communication requirements become more demanding. Traditionally, vehicles
have used specialized networking technologies designed to guarantee bounded
latencies, such as the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Recently, some have
used dedicated technologies to transport signals from cameras, lidars, radars,
and ultrasonic sensors. In parallel, IEEE working groups are defining Ethernet
standards for time-sensitive networks (TSN). This paper describes an
Ethernet-based architecture with provable guaranteed performance and simple
configuration that is suitable for supporting the communication requirements of
many vehicles.

monitoring methods by using continuously recorded monitoring SCADA (Supervisory
Control and Data Accusation) data points. Typically for wind turbine gearbox
condition monitoring; temperature readings, high frequency sounds and
vibrations in addition to lubricant condition monitoring have been used.
However, collection of such data, require shutting down equipment for
installation of costly sensors and measuring lubricant quality. Meanwhile,
operational data usually collected every 10 minutes, comprised of wind speed,
power generated, pitch angle and similar performance parameters can be used for
monitoring health of wind turbine components such as blades, gearbox and
generator. This paper uses gear rotational speed for monitoring health of
gearbox teeth; since gearbox teeth deterioration can be measured by monitoring
rotor to generator rotation ratios over extended period of time. As nature of
wind is turbulent with rapid fluctuations, a wind turbine may operate in
variety of modes within relatively short period of time. Monitoring rotational
speed ratio over time, requires consistent operational conditions such as wind
speed and torques within the gearbox. This paper also introduces the concept of
clustering such as Normal Mixture algorithm for dividing operating datasets
into consistent subgroups, which are used for long term monitoring.

  Inference",,,,,cs.CR cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The structure and weights of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) typically encode and
contain very valuable information about the dataset that was used to train the
network.
  One way to protect this information when DNN is published is to perform an
interference of the network using secure multi-party computations (MPC).
  In this paper, we suggest a translation of deep neural networks to
polynomials, which are easier to calculate efficiently with MPC techniques.
  We show a way to translate complete networks into a single polynomial and how
to calculate the polynomial with an efficient and information-secure MPC
algorithm.
  The calculation is done without intermediate communication between the
participating parties, which is beneficial in several cases, as explained in
the paper.
