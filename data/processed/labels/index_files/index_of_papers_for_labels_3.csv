deployment of these models outside the machine learning community has been
hindered by the difficulties of interpreting these models. This paper proposes
an algorithm that produces a continuous global interpretation of any given
continuous black-box function. Our algorithm employs a variation of projection
pursuit in which the ridge functions are chosen to be Meijer G-functions,
rather than the usual polynomial splines. Because Meijer G-functions are
differentiable in their parameters, we can tune the parameters of the
representation by gradient descent; as a consequence, our algorithm is
efficient. Using five familiar data sets from the UCI repository and two
familiar machine learning algorithms, we demonstrate that our algorithm
produces global interpretations that are both highly accurate and parsimonious
(involve a small number of terms). Our interpretations permit easy
understanding of the relative importance of features and feature interactions.
Our interpretation algorithm represents a leap forward from the previous state
of the art.

transform, such as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the Donoho--Stark
uncertainty principle, and Meshulam's non-abelian uncertainty principle, have
little to do with the structure of the Fourier transform itself. Rather, all of
these results follow from very weak properties of the Fourier transform (shared
by numerous linear operators), namely that it is bounded as an operator $L^1
\to L^\infty$, and that it is unitary. Using a single, simple proof template,
and only these (or weaker) properties, we obtain some new proofs and many
generalizations of these basic uncertainty principles, to new operators and to
new settings, in a completely unified way. Together with our general overview,
this paper can also serve as a survey of the many facets of the phenomena known
as uncertainty principles.

finding steady-state solutions for ODE systems that describe the kinetics of a
set of chemical reactions, especially sets composed of zero, first, and
second-order reactions. To compute a steady-state solution, one must set the
left-hand side of each ODE as zero, hence obtaining a system of non-negative,
quadratic polynomial equations. If all second-order reactions are homogeneous
in respect to their reactants, then the obtained quadratic polynomial equation
system will also have univariate monomials. Although it is a well-known fact
that finding a root of a quadratic polynomial equation system is a NP-hard
problem, it is not so easy to find a readily available proof of NP-hardness for
special cases like the aforementioned one. Therefore, we provide here a
self-contained proof that finding a root of non-negative, with univariate
monomials quadratic polynomial equation system (NUMQ-PES) is NP-hard. This
result implies that finding steady-state solutions for ODE systems of zero,
first and homogeneous second-order chemical reactions is a NP-hard problem;
hence, it is not a feasible approach to approximate non-homogeneous
second-order reactions into homogeneous ones.

  presented in the AAAI-22 Student Abstract and Poster Program",,,,cs.SI cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE cs.NI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Network alignment (NA) is the task of finding the correspondence of nodes
between two networks based on the network structure and node attributes. Our
study is motivated by the fact that, since most of existing NA methods have
attempted to discover all node pairs at once, they do not harness information
enriched through interim discovery of node correspondences to more accurately
find the next correspondences during the node matching. To tackle this
challenge, we propose Grad-Align, a new NA method that gradually discovers node
pairs by making full use of node pairs exhibiting strong consistency, which are
easy to be discovered in the early stage of gradual matching. Specifically,
Grad-Align first generates node embeddings of the two networks based on graph
neural networks along with our layer-wise reconstruction loss, a loss built
upon capturing the first-order and higher-order neighborhood structures. Then,
nodes are gradually aligned by computing dual-perception similarity measures
including the multi-layer embedding similarity as well as the Tversky
similarity, an asymmetric set similarity using the Tversky index applicable to
networks with different scales. Additionally, we incorporate an edge
augmentation module into Grad-Align to reinforce the structural consistency.
Through comprehensive experiments using real-world and synthetic datasets, we
empirically demonstrate that Grad-Align consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art NA methods.

  to Stochastic Min-Norm Load Balancing","An extended abstract is to appear in the Proceedings of the 5th SOSA,
  2022",,,,cs.DS,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We consider the Vector Scheduling problem on identical machines: we have m
machines, and a set J of n jobs, where each job j has a processing-time vector
$p_j\in \mathbb{R}^d_{\geq 0}$. The goal is to find an assignment $\sigma:J\to
[m]$ of jobs to machines so as to minimize the makespan $\max_{i\in
[m]}\max_{r\in [d]}( \sum_{j:\sigma(j)=i}p_{j,r})$. A natural lower bound on
the optimal makespan is lb $:=\max\{\max_{j\in J,r\in [d]}p_{j,r},\max_{r\in
[d]}(\sum_{j\in J}p_{j,r}/m)\}$. Our main result is a very simple O(log
d)-approximation algorithm for vector scheduling with respect to the lower
bound lb: we devise an algorithm that returns an assignment whose makespan is
at most O(log d)*lb.
  As an application, we show that the above guarantee leads to an O(log log
m)-approximation for Stochastic Minimum-Norm Load Balancing (StochNormLB). In
StochNormLB, we have m identical machines, a set J of n independent stochastic
jobs whose processing times are nonnegative random variables, and a monotone,
symmetric norm $f:\mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$. The goal is to find an
assignment $\sigma:J\to [m]$ that minimizes the expected $f$-norm of the
induced machine-load vector, where the load on machine i is the (random) total
processing time assigned to it. Our O(log log m)-approximation guarantee is in
fact much stronger: we obtain an assignment that is simultaneously an O(log log
m)-approximation for StochNormLB with all monotone, symmetric norms. Next, this
approximation factor significantly improves upon the O(log m/log log
m)-approximation in (Ibrahimpur and Swamy, FOCS 2020) for StochNormLB, and is a
consequence of a more-general black-box reduction that we present, showing that
a $\gamma(d)$-approximation for d-dimensional vector scheduling with respect to
the lower bound lb yields a simultaneous $\gamma(\log m)$-approximation for
StochNormLB with all monotone, symmetric norms.

  Accelerators",,,,,cs.LG cs.AR,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Dilated and transposed convolutions are widely used in modern convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). These kernels are used extensively during CNN training
and inference of applications such as image segmentation and high-resolution
image generation. Although these kernels have grown in popularity, they stress
current compute systems due to their high memory intensity, exascale compute
demands, and large energy consumption.
  We find that commonly-used low-power CNN inference accelerators based on
spatial architectures are not optimized for both of these convolutional
kernels. Dilated and transposed convolutions introduce significant zero padding
when mapped to the underlying spatial architecture, significantly degrading
performance and energy efficiency. Existing approaches that address this issue
require significant design changes to the otherwise simple, efficient, and
well-adopted architectures used to compute direct convolutions.
  To address this challenge, we propose EcoFlow, a new set of dataflows and
mapping algorithms for dilated and transposed convolutions. These algorithms
are tailored to execute efficiently on existing low-cost, small-scale spatial
architectures and requires minimal changes to the network-on-chip of existing
accelerators. EcoFlow eliminates zero padding through careful dataflow
orchestration and data mapping tailored to the spatial architecture. EcoFlow
enables flexible and high-performance transpose and dilated convolutions on
architectures that are otherwise optimized for CNN inference.
  We evaluate the efficiency of EcoFlow on CNN training workloads and
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) training workloads. Experiments in our new
cycle-accurate simulator show that EcoFlow 1) reduces end-to-end CNN training
time between 7-85%, and 2) improves end-to-end GAN training performance between
29-42%, compared to state-of-the-art CNN inference accelerators.

signal reconstruction/approximation. It plays a vital role in the development
of compressed sensing theory, and it also acts as a driving force for the
development of other heuristic methods for signal reconstruction. In this
paper, we propose the so-called dynamic orthogonal matching pursuit (DOMP) and
its two enhanced versions which are more efficient than OMP in signal
reconstruction from a numerical point of view, and we provide a rigorous
analysis for these algorithms in terms of the restricted isometry property
(RIP) of the sensing matrix. The main result claims that the reconstruction
error via the proposed algorithms can be controlled and measured with the
number of iterations, sparsity level of the signal and the noise level of the
measurements. The analysis in this paper sufficiently exploits the structure of
the DOMP and an auxiliary convex optimization model (called approximation
counterpart) to establish a mild RIP-based performance result for DOMP and its
enhanced versions. Dramatically different from existing results for OMP-like
algorithms, the results established for the algorithms proposed in this paper
do not need any traditional assumptions imposed on the smallest nonzero element
of the target signal which is unknown before being actually reconstructed.
Moveover, the finite convergence of the algorithms for a class of large-scale
compressed sensing problems is also discussed.

for consumers and hence accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles. A major
barrier to shorter charge times is the accelerated aging of the battery at
higher charging rates, which can be driven by lithium plating, increased solid
electrolyte interphase growth due to elevated temperatures, and particle
cracking due to mechanical stress. Lithium plating depends on the overpotential
of the negative electrode, and mechanical stress depends on the concentration
gradient, both of which cannot be measured directly. Techniques based on
physics-based models of the battery and optimal control algorithms have been
developed to this end. While these methods show promise in reducing
degradation, their optimization algorithms' complexity can limit their
implementation. In this paper, we present a method based on the constant
current constant voltage (CC-CV) charging scheme, called CC-CV$\eta \sigma$T
(VEST). The new approach is simpler to implement and can be used with any model
to impose varying levels of constraints on variables pertinent to degradation,
such as plating potential and mechanical stress. We demonstrate the new
CC-CV$\eta \sigma$T charging using an electrochemical model with mechanical and
thermal effects included. Furthermore, we discuss how uncertainties can be
accounted for by considering safety margins for the plating and stress
constraints.

cases in the fifth-generation (5G) networks, and its research is still in its
infancy due to its stringent and conflicting requirements in terms of extremely
high reliability and low latency. To reduce latency, the channel blocklength
for packet transmission is finite, which incurs transmission rate degradation
and higher decoding error probability. In this case, conventional resource
allocation based on Shannon capacity achieved with infinite blocklength codes
is not optimal. Security is another critical issue in mission-critical internet
of things (IoT) communications, and physical-layer security is a promising
technique that can ensure the confidentiality for wireless communications as no
additional channel uses are needed for the key exchange as in the conventional
upper-layer cryptography method. This paper is the first work to study the
resource allocation for a secure mission-critical IoT communication system with
URLLC. Specifically, we adopt the security capacity formula under finite
blocklength and consider two optimization problems: weighted throughput
maximization problem and total transmit power minimization problem. Each
optimization problem is non-convex and challenging to solve, and we develop
efficient methods to solve each optimization problem. Simulation results
confirm the fast convergence speed of our proposed algorithm and demonstrate

for general linear multi-agent systems (MASs) with external disturbances and
heterogeneous time-varying input and communication delays under a directed
communication graph topology, containing a spanning tree. First, for all agents
whose state matrix has no eigenvalues with positive real parts, a
communication-delay-related observer, which is used to construct the
controller, is designed for followers to estimate the leader's state
information. Second, by means of the output regulation theory, the results are
relaxed to the case that only the leader's state matrix eigenvalues have
non-positive real parts and, under these relaxed conditions, the controller is
redesigned. Both cases lead to a closed-loop error system of which the
stability is guaranteed via a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional with sufficient
conditions in terms of input-delay-dependent linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).
An extended LMI is proposed which, in conjunction with the rest of LMIs,
results in a solution with a larger upper bound on delays than what would be
feasible without it. It is highlighted that the integration of
communication-delay-related observer and input-delay-related LMI to construct a
fully distributed controller (which requires no global information) is scalable

grasping, and therefore dexterous manipulation. The soft gripper has shown
their potential in robust grasping due to their inherent properties-low,
control complexity, and high adaptability. However, the deformation of the soft
gripper when interacting with objects bring inaccuracy of grasped objects,
which causes instability for robust grasping and further manipulation. In this
paper, we present an omni-directional adaptive soft finger that can sense
deformation based on embedded optical fibers and the application of machine
learning methods to interpret transmitted light intensities. Furthermore, to
use tactile information provided by a soft finger, we design a low-cost and
multi degrees of freedom gripper to conform to the shape of objects actively
and optimize grasping policy, which is called Rigid-Soft Interactive Grasping.
Two main advantages of this grasping policy are provided: one is that a more
robust grasping could be achieved through an active adaptation; the other is
that the tactile information collected could be helpful for further
manipulation.

  Terahertz Communications",Submitted to IEEE Journals,,,,cs.IT math.IT,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Recently, terahertz (THz) communication has drawn considerable attention as
one of the promising technologies for the future wireless communications owning
to its ultra-wide bandwidth. Nonetheless, one major obstacle that prevents the
actual deployment of THz lies in its inherent huge attenuation. Intelligent
reflecting surface (IRS) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) represent
two effective solutions for compensating the large pathloss in THz systems. In
this paper, we consider an IRS-aided multi-user THz MIMO system with orthogonal
frequency division multiple access, where the sparse radio frequency chain
antenna structure is adopted for reducing the power consumption. The objective
is to maximize the weighted sum rate via jointly optimizing the hybrid
analog/digital beamforming at the base station and reflection matrix at the
IRS. {Since the analog beamforming and reflection matrix need to cater all
users and subcarriers, it is difficult to directly solve the formulated
problem, and thus, an alternatively iterative optimization algorithm is
proposed.} Specifically, the analog beamforming is designed by solving a MIMO
capacity maximization problem, while the digital beamforming and reflection
matrix optimization are both tackled using semidefinite relaxation technique.
Considering that obtaining perfect channel state information (CSI) is a
challenging task in IRS-based systems, we further explore the case with the
imperfect CSI for the channels from the IRS to users. Under this setup, we
propose a robust beamforming and reflection matrix design scheme for the
originally formulated non-convex optimization problem. Finally, simulation
results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithms.

handwriting synthesis, namely, style representation and content embedding,
remain unsolved. To this end, we propose a novel method that can synthesize
parameterized and controllable handwriting Styles for arbitrary-Length and
Out-of-vocabulary text based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), termed
SLOGAN. Specifically, we propose a style bank to parameterize the specific
handwriting styles as latent vectors, which are input to a generator as style
priors to achieve the corresponding handwritten styles. The training of the
style bank requires only the writer identification of the source images, rather
than attribute annotations. Moreover, we embed the text content by providing an
easily obtainable printed style image, so that the diversity of the content can
be flexibly achieved by changing the input printed image. Finally, the
generator is guided by dual discriminators to handle both the handwriting
characteristics that appear as separated characters and in a series of cursive
joins. Our method can synthesize words that are not included in the training
vocabulary and with various new styles. Extensive experiments have shown that
high-quality text images with great style diversity and rich vocabulary can be
synthesized using our method, thereby enhancing the robustness of the

spoken responses; non-native spoken grammar and written grammar. In practical
SQA, ASR systems are used, necessitating an investigation of the impact of ASR

the subject, but most known methods have an important drawback: the inferred
graph is not guaranteed to explain every interaction from the input trace. We
consider this an important issue since such inferred graph cannot be used as
input for applications that require a reliable estimate of the true graph. On
the other hand, a graph having trace feasibility guarantees can help us better
understand the true (hidden) interactions that may have taken place between
nodes of interest. The inference of such graph is the goal of this paper.
Firstly, given an activity log from a social network, we introduce a set of
constraints that take into consideration all the hidden paths that are possible
between the nodes of the trace, given their timestamps of interaction. Then, we
develop a nontrivial modification of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm by
Newman [1], that we call Constrained-EM, which incorporates the constraints and
a set of auxiliary variables into the inference process to guide it towards the
feasibility of the trace. Experimental results on real-world data from Twitter
confirm that Constrained-EM generates a posterior distribution of graphs that
explains all the events observed in the trace while presenting the desired
properties of a scale-free, small-world graph. Our method also outperforms

tempo estimation, beat tracking, key estimation or rhythm quantization. Unlike
these methods, our approach generates music notation directly from the input
audio in a single stage. For this, we use a Convolutional Recurrent Neural
Network (CRNN) with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function
which does not require annotated alignments of audio frames with the score
rhythmic information. We trained our model using as input Haydn, Mozart, and
Beethoven string quartets and Bach chorales synthesized with different tempos
and expressive performances. The output is a textual representation of
four-voice music scores based on **kern format. Although the proposed approach
is evaluated in a simplified scenario, results show that this model can learn

  Additive Models with Structured Interactions","33 pages, 6 figures",,,,stat.ML cs.LG stat.AP stat.CO,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Accurate and interpretable prediction of survey response rates is important
from an operational standpoint. The US Census Bureau's well-known ROAM
application uses principled statistical models trained on the US Census
Planning Database data to identify hard-to-survey areas. An earlier
crowdsourcing competition revealed that an ensemble of regression trees led to
the best performance in predicting survey response rates; however, the
corresponding models could not be adopted for the intended application due to
limited interpretability. In this paper, we present new interpretable
statistical methods to predict, with high accuracy, response rates in surveys.
We study sparse nonparametric additive models with pairwise interactions via
$\ell_0$-regularization, as well as hierarchically structured variants that
provide enhanced interpretability. Despite strong methodological underpinnings,
such models can be computationally challenging -- we present new scalable
algorithms for learning these models. We also establish novel non-asymptotic
error bounds for the proposed estimators. Experiments based on the US Census
Planning Database demonstrate that our methods lead to high-quality predictive
models that permit actionable interpretability for different segments of the
population. Interestingly, our methods provide significant gains in
interpretability without losing in predictive performance to state-of-the-art
black-box machine learning methods based on gradient boosting and feedforward
neural networks. Our code implementation in python is available at

specialized to be plain or entropy-compressed. Through experiments on large

viable alternative to standard pointer-based realizations, in practical
scenarios. Compared to na{\""i}ve approaches that compute the answer by explicit
traversal of the query path, our succinct data structures are several times
faster in path median queries and perform comparably in path counting and path

communication technique capable of creating a controllable propagation
environment. In this paper, we propose to invoke an IRS at the cell boundary of
multiple cells to assist the downlink transmission to cell-edge users, whilst
mitigating the inter-cell interference, which is a crucial issue in multicell
communication systems. We aim for maximizing the weighted sum rate (WSR) of all
users through jointly optimizing the active precoding matrices at the base
stations (BSs) and the phase shifts at the IRS subject to each BS's power
constraint and unit modulus constraint. Both the BSs and the users are equipped
with multiple antennas, which enhances the spectral efficiency by exploiting
the spatial multiplexing gain. Due to the non-convexity of the problem, we
first reformulate it into an equivalent one, which is solved by using the block
coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, where the precoding matrices and phase
shifts are alternately optimized. The optimal precoding matrices can be
obtained in closed form, when fixing the phase shifts. A pair of efficient
algorithms are proposed for solving the phase shift optimization problem,
namely the Majorization-Minimization (MM) Algorithm and the Complex Circle
Manifold (CCM) Method. Both algorithms are guaranteed to converge to at least
locally optimal solutions. We also extend the proposed algorithms to the more
general multiple-IRS and network MIMO scenarios. Finally, our simulation
results confirm the advantages of introducing IRSs in enhancing the cell-edge

adversarial examples. In the past few years, many efforts have been spent on
exploring query-optimisation attacks to find adversarial examples of either
black-box or white-box DNN models, as well as the defending countermeasures
against those attacks. In this work, we explore vulnerabilities of DNN models
under the umbrella of Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, which has not been
investigated before. From the perspective of an MitM adversary, the
aforementioned adversarial example attacks are not viable anymore. First, such
attacks must acquire the outputs from the models by multiple times before
actually launching attacks, which is difficult for the MitM adversary in
practice. Second, such attacks are one-off and cannot be directly generalised
onto new data examples, which decreases the rate of return for the attacker. In
contrast, using generative models to craft adversarial examples on the fly can
mitigate the drawbacks. However, the adversarial capability of the generative
models, such as Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), has not been extensively
studied. Therefore, given a classifier, we investigate using a VAE decoder to
either transform benign inputs to their adversarial counterparts or decode
outputs from benign VAE encoders to be adversarial examples. The proposed
method can endue more capability to MitM attackers. Based on our evaluation,
the proposed attack can achieve above 95% success rate on both MNIST and
CIFAR10 datasets, which is better or comparable with state-of-the-art
query-optimisation attacks. At the meantime, the attack is 104 times faster

a Single-Source DSO of size $O(M^{1/2}n^{3/2})$ with query time

to obtain deterministic Single-Source DSOs. The $\widetilde{O}(m\sqrt{n}+n^2)$
and $\widetilde{O}(Mn^\omega)$ preprocessing times are polynomial improvements
over previous $o(n^2)$-space oracles.
  On sparse graphs with $m=O(n^{5/4-\varepsilon}/M^{7/4})$ edges, for any
constant $\varepsilon > 0$, we reduce the preprocessing to randomized

the first truly subquadratic time algorithm for building Single-Source DSOs on

manipulator used in the design allows proper handling of nonlinearities,
uncertainties and disturbances involved in the problem. Specifically,
parametric uncertainties and disturbances are handled by the time delay
estimation and the nonlinearity of the manipulator is addressed by the feedback
structure of the controller. The combination of terminal sliding mode surface
and higher-order control scheme in the controller guarantees a fast response
with a small chattering amplitude. Moreover, the controller is designed with a
modified sliding mode surface and variable-gain structure, so that the
performance of the controller is further enhanced. We also analyze the

Finally, the simulation and experimental results prove that the proposed
control scheme has a precise performance in a robot manipulator system.

  blockchains",,,,,cs.NI cs.CR,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The current system to manage the global pool of IP addresses is centralized
in five transnational organizations, the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).
Each of these RIRs manage the address pool for a large number of countries.
Because the RIRs are private organizations, they are subject to the legal
framework of the country where they are based. This configuration results in a
jurisdictional overflow from the legal framework of the countries where the RIR
is based to all the countries that the RIRs are serving (the countries served
by the RIRs de facto become subjects of the legal system of the country where
the RIR is hosted). The situation is aggravated by the deployment of new
security techniques such as the RPKI and BGPsec, that enable enforcement of
allocations by the RIRs. In this paper we present InBlock, a blockchain-based
distributed governance body aimed to provide de-centralized management of IP
addresses. InBlock also aims to fulfil the same objectives as the current IP
address allocation system, namely, uniqueness, fairness, conservation,
aggregation, registration and minimized overhead. InBlock is implemented as a
Decentralized Autonomous Organization, i.e., as a set of blockchain's smart
contracts in Ethereum. Any entity may request an allocation of addresses to the
InBlock registry by solely performing a (crypto)currency transfer to the
InBlock. The fee required, along with the annual renewal fee, serves as a
mechanism to deter stockpiling and other wasteful practices. As with any novel
technology, there are many open questions about the usage of blockchains to
build an IP address registry. For this reason, we believe that practical
experimentation is required in order to have hands-on experiences about such a
system. We propose to conduct an experiment on distributed address management
using InBlock as a starting point to inform future directions in this area.

using the model to detect anomalies. Anomalies can come either from real
changes in the environment (real drift) or from faulty sensory devices (virtual
drift); however, the use of Autoencoders to distinguish between different
anomalies has not yet been considered. To this end, we first propose the
development of Bayesian Autoencoders to quantify epistemic and aleatoric
uncertainties. We then test the Bayesian Autoencoder using a real-world
industrial dataset for hydraulic condition monitoring. The system is injected
with noise and drifts, and we have found the epistemic uncertainty to be less
sensitive to sensor perturbations as compared to the reconstruction loss. By
observing the reconstructed signals with the uncertainties, we gain
interpretable insights, and these uncertainties offer a potential avenue for
distinguishing real and virtual drifts.

for obtaining adversarially robust models. A unique characteristic of AT is
that an inner maximization problem needs to be solved repeatedly before the
model weights can be updated, which makes the training slow. FGSM AT
significantly improves its efficiency but it fails when the step size grows.
The SOTA GradAlign makes FGSM AT compatible with a higher step size, however,
its regularization on input gradient makes it 3 to 4 times slower than FGSM AT.
Our proposed NoiseAug removes the extra computation overhead by directly
regularizing on the input itself. The key contribution of this work lies in an
empirical finding that single-step FGSM AT is not as hard as suggested in the
past line of work: noise augmentation is all you need for (FGSM) fast AT.
Towards understanding the success of our NoiseAug, we perform an extensive
analysis and find that mitigating Catastrophic Overfitting (CO) and Robust
Overfitting (RO) need different augmentations. Instead of more samples caused
by data augmentation, we identify what makes NoiseAug effective for preventing
CO might lie in its improved local linearity.

significantly less present in the zero-shot evaluation of the prompt-based

promising improvements on the three corresponding challenge datasets used to

therefore it is in the second level of the Fourier hierarchy. We show that
output probability distributions of the HC1Q model cannot be classically
efficiently sampled within a multiplicative error unless the polynomial-time
hierarchy collapses to the second level. The proof technique is different from
those used for previous sub-universal models, such as IQP, Boson Sampling, and
DQC1, and therefore the technique itself might be useful for finding other
sub-universal models that are hard to classically simulate. We also study the
classical verification of quantum computing in the second level of the Fourier
hierarchy. To this end, we define a promise problem, which we call the
probability distribution distinguishability with maximum norm (PDD-Max). It is
a promise problem to decide whether output probability distributions of two
quantum circuits are far apart or close. We show that PDD-Max is BQP-complete,

of the world's energy consumption. However, the energy use of buildings,
especially the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC), is far from
being efficient. There still exists a dramatic potential to save energy through
improving building energy efficiency. Therefore, this paper studies the control
of HVAC system for multi-zone buildings with the objective to reduce energy
consumption cost while satisfying thermal comfort. In particular, the thermal
couplings due to the heat transfer between the adjacent zones are incorporated
in the optimization. Considering that a centralized method is generally
computationally prohibitive for large buildings, an efficient decentralized
approach is developed, based on the Accelerated Distributed Augmented
Lagrangian (ADAL) method [1]. To evaluate the performance of the proposed
method, we first compare it with a centralized method, in which the optimal
solution of a small-scale problem can be obtained. We find that this
decentralized approach can almost approach the optimal solution of the problem.
Further, this decentralized approach is compared with the Distributed
Token-Based Scheduling Strategy (DTBSS) [2]. The numeric results reveal that
when the number of zones is relatively small (less than 20), the two
decentralized methods can achieve a comparable performance regarding the cost
of the HVAC system. However, with an increase of the number of zones in the
building, the proposed decentralized approach demonstrates better performance
with a considerable reduction of the total cost. Moreover, the decentralized
approach proposed in this paper demonstrate better scalability with less
average computation required.

Time Series (FTS), this paper seeks to assess if attention mechanisms can
further improve performance. The hypothesis is that attention can help prevent
long-term dependencies experienced by LSTM models. To test this hypothesis, the
main contribution of this paper is the implementation of an LSTM with
attention. Both the benchmark LSTM and the LSTM with attention were compared
and both achieved reasonable performances of up to 60% on five stocks from
Kaggle's Two Sigma dataset. This comparative analysis demonstrates that an LSTM
with attention can indeed outperform standalone LSTMs but further investigation
is required as issues do arise with such model architectures.

  a case study in intelligent structural control","16 pages, 16 figures",,,,cs.LG cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  In many reinforcement learning (RL) problems, it takes some time until a
taken action by the agent reaches its maximum effect on the environment and
consequently the agent receives the reward corresponding to that action by a
delay called action-effect delay. Such delays reduce the performance of the
learning algorithm and increase the computational costs, as the reinforcement
learning agent values the immediate rewards more than the future reward that is
more related to the taken action. This paper addresses this issue by
introducing an applicable enhanced Q-learning method in which at the beginning
of the learning phase, the agent takes a single action and builds a function
that reflects the environments response to that action, called the reflexive
$\gamma$ - function. During the training phase, the agent utilizes the created
reflexive $\gamma$- function to update the Q-values. We have applied the
developed method to a structural control problem in which the goal of the agent
is to reduce the vibrations of a building subjected to earthquake excitations
with a specified delay. Seismic control problems are considered as a complex
task in structural engineering because of the stochastic and unpredictable
nature of earthquakes and the complex behavior of the structure. Three
scenarios are presented to study the effects of zero, medium, and long
action-effect delays and the performance of the Enhanced method is compared to
the standard Q-learning method. Both RL methods use neural network to learn to
estimate the state-action value function that is used to control the structure.
The results show that the enhanced method significantly outperforms the
performance of the original method in all cases, and also improves the
stability of the algorithm in dealing with action-effect delays.

coarse-to-fine level disentanglement of spatial contents and styles. In
addition, our generator can be easily integrated into the GAN inversion

aggregation, in that either lacks robustness to severe deformations or inherit
the limitation of CNNs that fail to discriminate incorrect matches due to
limited receptive fields, CATs explore global consensus among initial
correlation map with the help of some architectural designs that allow us to
fully leverage self-attention mechanism. Specifically, we include appearance
affinity modeling to aid the cost aggregation process in order to disambiguate
the noisy initial correlation maps and propose multi-level aggregation to
efficiently capture different semantics from hierarchical feature

the governing flow equations to provide a model for sub-grid-scale stresses in
a temporally developing plane turbulent jet at Reynolds number $Re_0=6\,000$.
The objective function for training is first based on the instantaneous
filtered velocity fields from a corresponding direct numerical simulation, and
the training is by a stochastic gradient descent method, which uses the adjoint
Navier--Stokes equations to provide the end-to-end sensitivities of the model
weights to the velocity fields. In-sample and out-of-sample testing on multiple
dual-jet configurations show that its required mesh density in each coordinate
direction for prediction of mean flow, Reynolds stresses, and spectra is half
that needed by the dynamic Smagorinsky model for comparable accuracy. The same
neural-network model trained directly to match filtered sub-grid-scale stresses
-- without the constraint of being embedded within the flow equations during
the training -- fails to provide a qualitatively correct prediction. The
coupled formulation is generalized to train based only on mean-flow and
Reynolds stresses, which are more readily available in experiments. The
mean-flow training provides a robust model, which is important, though a
somewhat less accurate prediction for the same coarse meshes, as might be
anticipated due to the reduced information available for training in this case.
The anticipated advantage of the formulation is that the inclusion of resolved
physics in the training increases its capacity to extrapolate. This is assessed
for the case of passive scalar transport, for which it outperforms established
models due to improved mixing predictions.

This output can be viewed as a classical analogue to the output of quantum

attention in power transmission industry. Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is
classified among the biggest widely used methods used within the context of
asset management policy to detect the incipient faults in their earlier stage
in power transformers. Up to now, several procedures have been employed for the
lecture of DGA results. Among these useful means, we find Key Gases, Rogers
Ratios, IEC Ratios, the historical technique less used today Doernenburg
Ratios, the two types of Duval Pentagons methods, several versions of the Duval
Triangles method and Logarithmic Nomograph. Problem. DGA data extracted from
different units in service served to verify the ability and reliability of
these methods in assessing the state of health of the power transformer. Aim.
An improving the quality of diagnostics of electrical power transformer by
artificial neural network tools based on two conventional methods in the case
of a functional power transformer at S\'etif province in East North of Algeria.
Methodology. Design an inelegant tool for power transformer diagnosis using
neural networks based on traditional methods IEC and Rogers, which allows to
early detection faults, to increase the reliability, of the entire electrical
energy system from transport to consumers and improve a continuity and quality
of service. Results. The solution of the problem was carried out by using
feed-forward back-propagation neural networks implemented in MATLAB-Simulink
environment. Four real power transformers working under different environment
and climate conditions such as: desert, humid, cold were taken into account.
The practical results of the diagnosis of these power transformers by the DGA
are presented. Practical value.....

  Linguistics and Intellectual Technologies (Dialogue'2015)",,,,cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The paper gives an overview of the Russian Semantic Similarity Evaluation
(RUSSE) shared task held in conjunction with the Dialogue 2015 conference.
There exist a lot of comparative studies on semantic similarity, yet no
analysis of such measures was ever performed for the Russian language.
Exploring this problem for the Russian language is even more interesting,
because this language has features, such as rich morphology and free word
order, which make it significantly different from English, German, and other
well-studied languages. We attempt to bridge this gap by proposing a shared
task on the semantic similarity of Russian nouns. Our key contribution is an
evaluation methodology based on four novel benchmark datasets for the Russian
language. Our analysis of the 105 submissions from 19 teams reveals that
successful approaches for English, such as distributional and skip-gram models,
are directly applicable to Russian as well. On the one hand, the best results
in the contest were obtained by sophisticated supervised models that combine
evidence from different sources. On the other hand, completely unsupervised
approaches, such as a skip-gram model estimated on a large-scale corpus, were
able score among the top 5 systems.

  Le Leannec",Neural Network based Inter bi-prediction Blending,,VCIP 2021,,,eess.IV cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  This paper presents a learning-based method to improve bi-prediction in video
coding. In conventional video coding solutions, the motion compensation of
blocks from already decoded reference pictures stands out as the principal tool
used to predict the current frame. Especially, the bi-prediction, in which a
block is obtained by averaging two different motion-compensated prediction
blocks, significantly improves the final temporal prediction accuracy. In this
context, we introduce a simple neural network that further improves the
blending operation. A complexity balance, both in terms of network size and
encoder mode selection, is carried out. Extensive tests on top of the recently
standardized VVC codec are performed and show a BD-rate improvement of -1.4% in
random access configuration for a network size of fewer than 10k parameters. We
also propose a simple CPU-based implementation and direct network quantization
to assess the complexity/gains tradeoff in a conventional codec framework.

partial differential equation describing high intensity ultrasound propagation
as widely used in medical imaging and therapy. The usual nonlinear term in the
standard model using the Westervelt equation in pressure formulation is of the
form $p p_t$. However, this should be considered as a low order approximation
to a more complex physical model where higher order terms will be required.
Here we assume a more general case where the form taken is $f(p)\,p_t$ and $f$
is unknown and must be recovered from data measurements. Corresponding to the
typical measurement setup, the overposed data consists of time trace
observations of the acoustic pressure at a single point or on a one dimensional
set $\Sigma$ representing the receiving transducer array at a fixed time.
Additionally to an analysis of well-posedness of the resulting {\sc pde}, we
show injectivity of the linearized forward map from $f$ to the overposed data
and use this as motivation for several iterative schemes to recover $f$.
Numerical simulations will also be shown to illustrate the efficiency of the
methods.

  Embedding",Accepted by Findings of ACL 2021,,,,cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Semantic embedding has been widely investigated for aligning knowledge graph
(KG) entities. Current methods have explored and utilized the graph structure,
the entity names and attributes, but ignore the ontology (or ontological
schema) which contains critical meta information such as classes and their
membership relationships with entities. In this paper, we propose an
ontology-guided entity alignment method named OntoEA, where both KGs and their
ontologies are jointly embedded, and the class hierarchy and the class
disjointness are utilized to avoid false mappings. Extensive experiments on
seven public and industrial benchmarks have demonstrated the state-of-the-art
performance of OntoEA and the effectiveness of the ontologies.

constrained distributions in very high dimension, upwards of 100,000, can be
sampled efficiently $\textit{in practice}$. Our algorithm incorporates
constraints into the Riemannian version of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and
maintains sparsity. This allows us to achieve a mixing rate independent of
smoothness and condition numbers.
  On benchmark data sets in systems biology and linear programming, our
algorithm outperforms existing packages by orders of magnitude. In particular,
we achieve a 1,000-fold speed-up for sampling from the largest published human
metabolic network (RECON3D). Our package has been incorporated into the COBRA
toolbox.

  Automated Schema Refactoring","20 pages, to appear in 42nd ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming
  Language Design and Implementation (PLDI 2021)",,10.1145/3453483.3454028,,cs.PL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Serializability is a well-understood concurrency control mechanism that eases
reasoning about highly-concurrent database programs. Unfortunately, enforcing
serializability has a high-performance cost, especially on geographically
distributed database clusters. Consequently, many databases allow programmers
to choose when a transaction must be executed under serializability, with the
expectation that transactions would only be so marked when necessary to avoid
serious concurrency bugs. However, this is a significant burden to impose on
developers, requiring them to (a) reason about subtle concurrent interactions
among potentially interfering transactions, (b) determine when such
interactions would violate desired invariants, and (c) then identify the
minimum number of transactions whose executions should be serialized to prevent
these violations. To mitigate this burden, in this paper we present a sound and
fully automated schema refactoring procedure that transforms a program's data
layout -- rather than its concurrency control logic -- to eliminate statically
identified concurrency bugs, allowing more transactions to be safely executed
under weaker and more performant database guarantees. Experimental results over
a range of database benchmarks indicate that our approach is highly effective
in eliminating concurrency bugs, with safe refactored programs showing an
average of 120% higher throughput and 45% lower latency compared to the
baselines.

  Driving",,,,,cs.SD cs.AI cs.RO eess.AS,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Emergency vehicles in service have right-of-way over all other vehicles.
Hence, all other vehicles are supposed to take proper actions to yield
emergency vehicles with active sirens. As this task requires the cooperation
between ears and eyes for human drivers, it also needs audio detection as a
supplement to vision-based algorithms for fully autonomous driving vehicles. In
urban driving scenarios, we need to know both the existence of emergency
vehicles and their relative positions to us to decide the proper actions. We
present a novel system from collecting the real-world siren data to the
deployment of models using only two cost-efficient microphones. We are able to
achieve promising performance for each task separately, especially within the
crucial 10m to 50m distance range to react (the size of our ego vehicle is
around 5m in length and 2m in width). The recall rate to determine the
existence of sirens is 99.16% , the median and mean angle absolute error is
9.64{\deg} and 19.18{\deg} respectively, and the median and mean distance
absolute error of 9.30m and 10.58m respectively within that range. We also
benchmark various machine learning approaches that can determine the siren
existence and sound source localization which includes direction and distance
simultaneously within 50ms of latency.
