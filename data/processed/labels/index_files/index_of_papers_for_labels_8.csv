  Cartesian-grid KS DFT",,"Theoretical Chemistry Accounts 140 (1), 1-9 (2021)",,,physics.chem-ph,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Photon-induced electronic excitations are ubiquitously observed in organic
chromophore. In this context, we present a simple, alternative time-independent
DFT procedure, for computation of single-particle excitation energies, in
particular, the lower bound excited singlet states, which are of primary
interest in photochemistry. This takes inspiration from recently developed
Becke's exciton model, where a key step constitutes the accurate evaluation of
correlated singlet-triplet splitting energy. It introduces a non-empirical
model, both from ""adiabatic connection theorem"" and ""virial theorem"" to analyze
the role of 2e$^-$ integral in such calculations. The latter quantity is
efficiently mapped onto a real grid and computed accurately using a purely
numerical strategy. Illustrative calculations are performed on 10
$\pi$-electron organic chromophores within a Cartesian-grid implementation of
pseudopotential Kohn-Sham (KS) DFT, developed in our laboratory, taking
SBKJC-type basis functions within B3LYP approximation. The triplet and singlet
excitation energies corresponding to first singly excited configuration, are
found to be in excellent agreement with TD-B3LYP calculations. Further, we
perform the same for a set of larger molecular systems using the asymptotically
corrected LC-BLYP, in addition to B3LYP. A systematic comparison with
theoretical best estimates demonstrates the viability and suitability of
current approach in determining optical gaps, combining predictive accuracy
with moderate computational cost.

growth in the inflation rate has compelled people to invest in the stock and
commodity markets and other areas rather than saving. Further, the ability of
Deep Learning models to make predictions on the time series data has been
proven time and again. Technical analysis on the stock market with the help of
technical indicators has been the most common practice among traders and
investors. One more aspect is the sentiment analysis - the emotion of the
investors that shows the willingness to invest. A variety of techniques have
been used by people around the globe involving basic Machine Learning and
Neural Networks. Ranging from the basic linear regression to the advanced
neural networks people have experimented with all possible techniques to
predict the stock market. It's evident from recent events how news and
headlines affect the stock markets and cryptocurrencies. This paper proposes an
ensemble of state-of-the-art methods for predicting stock prices. Firstly
sentiment analysis of the news and the headlines for the company Apple Inc,
listed on the NASDAQ is performed using a version of BERT, which is a
pre-trained transformer model by Google for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Afterward, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) predicts the stock price for
Apple Inc using the technical indicators, stock indexes of various countries,
some commodities, and historical prices along with the sentiment scores.

While it has long been believed that the constriction is driven by motor
proteins, it has recently been discovered that passive crosslinkers that do not
turn over fuel are able to generate enough force to constrict actin filament
rings. We develop an analytical model that considers both this passive
crosslinker force, here modeled as a force based on condensation of the
crosslinkers from solution, and the opposing elastic bending force, which we
use to make predictions about the maximum constriction forces that could be
generated by this system for varying ring topologies and crosslinker
concentrations. Our predictions indicate that such a mechanism could play an
important role in deforming the plasma membrane during cell division, or as a

but it usually requires a large numberof images labeled with fine-grained

adaptation (UDA) methods to borrow in-formation from labeled data from other

absence of labels in the target domain, the performance ofUDA methods is much
worse than that of the fully supervisedmethod. In this paper, we propose a
weakly supervised do-main adaptation setting, in which we can partially label
newdatasets with bounding boxes, which are easier and cheaperto obtain than

of directly imaged exoplanet spectra and to produce sample spectra of the
bright, nearby exoplanet $\upsilon$ Andromedae d, a potential direct imaging
target for next-generation facilities. We introduce a new, fast, and accurate
subsampling technique that enables calculations of disk-integrated spectra one
order of magnitude faster than Chebyshev-Gauss sampling for moderate- to
high-resolution sampling. Using this method and a first-principles-derived
atmosphere for $\upsilon$ And d, we simulate phase-dependent spectra for a
variety of different potential atmospheric configurations. The simulated
spectra for $\upsilon$ And d include versions with different haze and cloud

phase-and illumination-appropriate model spectra, and realistic instrument
noise parameters, we find that $\upsilon$ And d is a potentially favorable
direct imaging and spectroscopy target for the Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) on
the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. When a noise model corresponding to the

generalized fractal dimension was defined by Renyi entropy. Using fractal
dimension, we can describe urban growth and form and characterize spatial
complexity. A number of fractal models and measurements have been proposed for
urban studies. However, the precondition for fractal dimension application is
to find scaling relations in cities. In absence of scaling property, we can
make use of entropy function and measurements. This paper is devoted to
researching how to describe urban growth by using spatial entropy. By analogy
with fractal dimension growth models of cities, a pair of entropy increase
models can be derived and a set of entropy-based measurements can be
constructed to describe urban growing process and patterns. First, logistic
function and Boltzmann equation are utilized to model the entropy increase
curves of urban growth. Second, a series of indexes based on spatial entropy
are used to characterize urban form. Further, multifractal dimension spectrums
are generalized to spatial entropy spectrums. Conclusions are drawn as follows.
Entropy and fractal dimension have both intersection and different spheres of
application to urban research. Thus, for a given spatial measurement scale,
fractal dimension can often be replaced by spatial entropy for simplicity. The
models and measurements presented in this work are significant for integrating
entropy and fractal dimension into the same framework of urban spatial analysis
and understanding spatial complexity of cities.

magnetar, XTE J1810-197, which exhibited a radio outburst from December 2018
after its 10-year quiescent period. We performed quasi-simultaneous
observations with VERA (22 GHz), Hitachi (6.9 GHz and 8.4 GHz), Kashima (2.3
GHz), and Iitate (0.3 GHz) radio telescopes located in Japan to trace the
variability of the magnetar radio pulsations during the observing period from
13 December 2018 to 12 June 2019. The pulse width goes narrower as the
observing frequency goes higher, analogous to the general profile narrowing
behavior of ordinary pulsars. When assuming a simple power law in the range of
2.3 GHz and 8.7 GHz, the radio spectrum of the magnetar goes steeper with the
average spectral index $ \langle \alpha \rangle \approx -0.85$ for the first
four months. The wide-band radio spectra inferred from our observations and the
literature suggest that XTE J1810-197 would have a double-peaked spectrum with
a valley point in 22 - 150 GHz, where the first spectral peak infers a
gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) feature with a peak at a few GHz. The GPS and
the high-frequency peak have been identified in the spectra of other radio-loud
magnetars, thus they may be intrinsic features that can give a new insight to
understand various emission mechanisms and surrounding environments of radio
magnetars. Our study emphasizes the importance of simultaneous long-term
broad-band observations toward radio-loud magnetars to capture the puzzling
spectral features and establish a link to other types of neutron stars.

  Engineering",,,,cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG stat.ML,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Most topic models are constructed under the assumption that documents follow
a multinomial distribution. The Poisson distribution is an alternative
distribution to describe the probability of count data. For topic modelling,
the Poisson distribution describes the number of occurrences of a word in
documents of fixed length. The Poisson distribution has been successfully
applied in text classification, but its application to topic modelling is not
well documented, specifically in the context of a generative probabilistic
model. Furthermore, the few Poisson topic models in literature are admixture
models, making the assumption that a document is generated from a mixture of
topics. In this study, we focus on short text. Many studies have shown that the
simpler assumption of a mixture model fits short text better. With mixture
models, as opposed to admixture models, the generative assumption is that a
document is generated from a single topic. One topic model, which makes this
one-topic-per-document assumption, is the Dirichlet-multinomial mixture model.
The main contributions of this work are a new Gamma-Poisson mixture model, as
well as a collapsed Gibbs sampler for the model. The benefit of the collapsed
Gibbs sampler derivation is that the model is able to automatically select the
number of topics contained in the corpus. The results show that the
Gamma-Poisson mixture model performs better than the Dirichlet-multinomial
mixture model at selecting the number of topics in labelled corpora.
Furthermore, the Gamma-Poisson mixture produces better topic coherence scores
than the Dirichlet-multinomial mixture model, thus making it a viable option
for the challenging task of topic modelling of short text.

solvers. We realized type-aware operator mutation within the OpFuzz tool and
used it to stress-test Z3 and CVC4, two state-of-the-art SMT solvers.
Type-aware operator mutations are unusually effective: During one year of
extensive testing with OpFuzz, we reported 1,092 bugs on Z3's and CVC4's
respective GitHub issue trackers, out of which 819 unique bugs were confirmed
and 685 of the confirmed bugs were fixed by the developers. The detected bugs
are highly diverse -- we found bugs of many different types (soundness bugs,
invalid model bugs, crashes, etc.), logics and solver configurations. We have
further conducted an in-depth study of the bugs found by OpFuzz. The study
results show that the bugs found by OpFuzz are of high quality. Many of them
affect core components of the SMT solvers' codebases, and some required major
changes for the developers to fix. Among the 819 confirmed bugs found by
OpFuzz, 184 were soundness bugs, the most critical bugs in SMT solvers, and 489

soundness bugs in CVC4, which has proved to be a very stable SMT solver.

deep neural networks (DNNs) are not compatible with standard encoders and would
be difficult to deply on personal computers and cellphones. In light of this,
we propose a system that learns to improve the encoding performance by
enhancing its internal neural representations on both the encoder and decoder
ends, an approach we call Neural JPEG. We propose frequency domain pre-editing
and post-editing methods to optimize the distribution of the DCT coefficients
at both encoder and decoder ends in order to improve the standard compression
(JPEG) method. Moreover, we design and integrate a scheme for jointly learning
quantization tables within this hybrid neural compression framework.Experiments
demonstrate that our approach successfully improves the rate-distortion
performance over JPEG across various quality metrics, such as PSNR and MS-SSIM,
and generates visually appealing images with better color retention quality.

guidance information for the alignment of two images, which, in turn, is
crucial for many medical applications. However, manual landmark annotation is
labor-intensive. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end deep learning approach to
automatically detect landmark correspondences in pairs of two-dimensional (2D)
images. Our approach consists of a Siamese neural network, which is trained to
identify salient locations in images as landmarks and predict matching
probabilities for landmark pairs from two different images. We trained our
approach on 2D transverse slices from 168 lower abdominal Computed Tomography
(CT) scans. We tested the approach on 22,206 pairs of 2D slices with varying
levels of intensity, affine, and elastic transformations. The proposed approach
finds an average of 639, 466, and 370 landmark matches per image pair for
intensity, affine, and elastic transformations, respectively, with spatial
matching errors of at most 1 mm. Further, more than 99% of the landmark pairs
are within a spatial matching error of 2 mm, 4 mm, and 8 mm for image pairs
with intensity, affine, and elastic transformations, respectively. To
investigate the utility of our developed approach in a clinical setting, we
also tested our approach on pairs of transverse slices selected from follow-up
CT scans of three patients. Visual inspection of the results revealed landmark
matches in both bony anatomical regions as well as in soft tissues lacking
prominent intensity gradients.

isotropic eikonal equation, there has been tremendous progress on the topic
addressing an array of challenges including improvement of the solution
accuracy, incorporation of surface topography, adding more accurate physics by
accounting for anisotropy/attenuation in the medium, and speeding up
computations using multiple CPUs and GPUs. Despite these advances, there is no
mechanism in these algorithms to carry on information gained by solving one
problem to the next. Moreover, these approaches may breakdown for certain
complex forms of the eikonal equation, requiring approximation methods to
estimate the solution. Therefore, we seek an alternate approach to address the
challenge in a holistic manner, i.e., a method that not only makes it simpler
to incorporate topography, allow accounting for any level of complexity in
physics, benefiting from computational speedup due to the availability of
multiple CPUs or GPUs, but also able to transfer knowledge gained from solving
one problem to the next. We develop an algorithm based on the emerging paradigm
of physics-informed neural network to solve various forms of the eikonal
equation. We show how transfer learning and surrogate modeling can be used to
speed up computations by utilizing information gained from prior solutions. We
also propose a two-stage optimization scheme to expedite the training process
in presence of sharper heterogeneity in the velocity model. Furthermore, we
demonstrate how the proposed approach makes it simpler to incorporate
additional physics and other features in contrast to conventional methods that
took years and often decades to make these advances. Such an approach not only
makes the implementation of eikonal solvers much simpler but also puts us on a
much faster path to progress.

producing realistic textures using an external reference (Ref) image. However,
existing RefSR methods obtain high-quality correspondence matchings consuming
quadratic computation resources with respect to the input size, limiting its
application. Moreover, these approaches usually suffer from scale misalignments
between the low-resolution (LR) image and Ref image. In this paper, we propose
an Accelerated Multi-Scale Aggregation network (AMSA) for Reference-based
Super-Resolution, including Coarse-to-Fine Embedded PatchMatch (CFE-PatchMatch)
and Multi-Scale Dynamic Aggregation (MSDA) module. To improve matching
efficiency, we design a novel Embedded PatchMacth scheme with random samples
propagation, which involves end-to-end training with asymptotic linear
computational cost to the input size. To further reduce computational cost and
speed up convergence, we apply the coarse-to-fine strategy on Embedded
PatchMacth constituting CFE-PatchMatch. To fully leverage reference information
across multiple scales and enhance robustness to scale misalignment, we develop
the MSDA module consisting of Dynamic Aggregation and Multi-Scale Aggregation.
The Dynamic Aggregation corrects minor scale misalignment by dynamically
aggregating features, and the Multi-Scale Aggregation brings robustness to
large scale misalignment by fusing multi-scale information. Experimental
results show that the proposed AMSA achieves superior performance over

design of a control law that reactively integrates the longitudinal surface
gradient of road into its operation. In contrast to the existing works, we
found that integrating the path gradient into the control framework improves
the speed tracking efficacy. Since the control law is implemented over a
shrinking domain scheme, it minimizes the integrated error by recomputing the
control inputs at every discretized step and consequently provides less
reaction time. This makes our control law suitable for motion planning
frameworks that are operating at high frequencies. Furthermore, our work is
implemented using a generalized vehicle model and can be easily extended to
other classes of vehicles. The performance of gradient aware-shrinking domain

a number of sensors are mounted. Results from the tests show the robustness of
our control law for speed tracking on a terrain with varying gradient while
also considering stringent time constraints imposed by the planning framework.

platforms, such as social robotics and self-driving cars. Many trajectory
planning algorithms use a reference curve based Frenet frame with time to
reduce the planning dimension. However, there is a common implicit assumption
in classic trajectory planning approaches, which is that the generated
trajectory should follow the reference curve continuously. This assumption is
not always true in real applications and it might cause some undesired issues
in planning. One issue is that the projection of the planned trajectory onto
the reference curve maybe discontinuous. Then, some segments on the reference
curve are not the image of any part of the planned path. Another issue is that
the planned path might self-intersect when following a simple reference curve
continuously. The generated trajectories are unnatural and suboptimal ones when
these issues happen. In this paper, we firstly demonstrate these issues and
then introduce an efficient trajectory generation method which uses a new
transformation from the Cartesian frame to Frenet frames. Experimental results
on a simulated street scenario demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

heating in the EAST tokamak are studied numerically. RMPs with linear resistive
magnetohydrodynamics response are used in the modeling. A variety of
representing configurations of RMP coil currents are examined and their effects
on the NBI heating efficiency are compared, in order to find a parameter window
where deleterious effects of RMPs on NBI heating efficiency are minimized. It
is found that the internal redistribution of fast ions by RMPs induces local
accumulation of fast ions, resulting in higher local fast ion pressure than the
case without RMPs. It is also found that the toroidal phasing of the RMP with
respect to the fast ion source has slight effects on the steady-state radial
profile of fast ions. The dependence of fast ion loss fraction on the RMP
up-down phase difference shows similar behavior as the dependence of the radial
width of chaotic magnetic field on the phase difference. A statistical method
of identifying resonances between RMPs and lost fast ions is proposed and the
results indicate that some resonances between RMPs and lost passing particles
may be of non-integer fractional order, rather than the usual integer order.

can be further relaxed and the sparsity bound improved if we consider only the

use a convolutional autoencoder as a generator to create new images by

measure the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW) by cross-correlating the galaxy
survey maps with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) map. We use the Cosmic
Infrared Background (CIB) as a tracer of the LSS to perform a theoretical
CIB-CMB cross-correlation to measure the ISW for different Planck HFI
frequencies. We discuss the detectability of this ISW signal using a
Signal-to-noise ratio analysis and find that the ISW detected this way can
provide us with the highest SNR for a single tracer ranging from 5 to 6.7
(maximum being for 857 GHz) with the CIB and CMB maps extracted over the whole
sky. A Fisher matrix analysis showed that this measurement of the ISW can
improve the constraints on the cosmological parameters; especially the equation
of state of the dark energy $w$ by $\sim 47\%$. Performing a more realistic
analysis including the galactic dust residuals in the CIB maps over realistic
sky fractions shows that the dust power spectra dominate over the CIB power
spectra at $\ell < 100$ and ISW can't be detected with high SNR. We perform the
cross-correlation on the existing CIB-CMB maps over $\sim 11\%$ of the sky in
the southern hemisphere and find that the ISW is not detected with the existing
CIB maps over such small sky fractions.

robot navigation, semantic perception, manipulation, and telepresence. Several
methods of combining range- and color-data have been investigated and
successfully used in various robotic applications. Most of these systems suffer
from the problems of noise in the range-data and resolution mismatch between
the range sensor and the color cameras, since the resolution of current range
sensors is much less than the resolution of color cameras. High-resolution
depth maps can be obtained using stereo matching, but this often fails to
construct accurate depth maps of weakly/repetitively textured scenes, or if the
scene exhibits complex self-occlusions. Range sensors provide coarse depth
information regardless of presence/absence of texture. The use of a calibrated
system, composed of a time-of-flight (TOF) camera and of a stereoscopic camera
pair, allows data fusion thus overcoming the weaknesses of both individual
sensors. We propose a novel TOF-stereo fusion method based on an efficient
seed-growing algorithm which uses the TOF data projected onto the stereo image
pair as an initial set of correspondences. These initial ""seeds"" are then
propagated based on a Bayesian model which combines an image similarity score
with rough depth priors computed from the low-resolution range data. The
overall result is a dense and accurate depth map at the resolution of the color
cameras at hand. We show that the proposed algorithm outperforms 2D image-based
stereo algorithms and that the results are of higher resolution than
off-the-shelf color-range sensors, e.g., Kinect. Moreover, the algorithm
potentially exhibits real-time performance on a single CPU.

genomics applications. It is used to identify potential matches and differences
between fragments (called reads) of a sequenced genome and an already known
genome (called a reference genome). To address the computational challenges in
genome analysis, many prior works propose various approaches such as filters
that select the reads that must undergo expensive computation, efficient
heuristics, and hardware acceleration. While effective at reducing the
computation overhead, all such approaches still require the costly movement of
a large amount of data from storage to the rest of the system, which can
significantly lower the end-to-end performance of read mapping in conventional
and emerging genomics systems.
  We propose GenStore, the first in-storage processing system designed for
genome sequence analysis that greatly reduces both data movement and
computational overheads of genome sequence analysis by exploiting low-cost and
accurate in-storage filters. GenStore leverages hardware/software co-design to
address the challenges of in-storage processing, supporting reads with 1)
different read lengths and error rates, and 2) different degrees of genetic
variation. Through rigorous analysis of read mapping processes, we meticulously
design low-cost hardware accelerators and data/computation flows inside a NAND
flash-based SSD. Our evaluation using a wide range of real genomic datasets
shows that GenStore, when implemented in three modern SSDs, significantly
improves the read mapping performance of state-of-the-art software (hardware)

continues a challenging problem due to the increased scale of dimensions and
complexity of today's IT monitoring systems. Recent progress of unsupervised
time-series anomaly detection mainly use deep autoencoders to solve this
problem, i.e. training on normal samples and producing significant
reconstruction error on abnormal inputs. However, in practice, autoencoders can
reconstruct anomalies so well, due to powerful capabilites of neural networks.
Besides, these approaches can be ineffective for identifying non-point
anomalies, e.g. contextual anomalies and collective anomalies, since they
solely utilze a point-wise reconstruction objective. To tackle the above
issues, we propose MemAAE (\textit{Memory-augmented Adversarial Autoencoders

show that detecting anomalies via multiple tasks obtains superior performance
rather than single-task training. Additionally, a compressive memory module is
introduced to preserve normal patterns, avoiding unexpected generalization on
abnormal inputs. Through extensive experiments, MemAAE achieves an overall F1
score of 0.90 on four public datasets, significantly outperforming the best

rate, which is set by the opacity of its envelope. Accreting dust and pebbles
contribute to the envelope opacity and, thus, influence the outcome of planet
formation. Our aim is to model the size evolution and opacity contribution of
solids inside planetary envelopes. We then use the resultant opacity relations
to study emergent trends in planet formation. We design a model for the opacity
of solids in planetary envelopes that accounts for the growth, fragmentation
and erosion of pebbles during their sedimentation. We formulate analytical
expressions for the opacity of pebbles and dust and map out their trends as a
function of depth, planet mass, distance and accretion rate. We find that the
accretion of pebbles rather than planetesimals can produce fully convective
envelopes, but only in lower-mass planets that reside in the outer disk or in
those that are accreting pebbles at a high rate. In these conditions, pebble
sizes are limited by fragmentation and erosion, allowing them to pile up in the
envelope. At higher planetary masses or reduced accretion rates, a different
regime applies where the sizes of sedimenting pebbles are only limited by their
rate of growth. The opacity in this growth-limited regime is much lower,
steeply declines with depth and planet mass but is invariant with the pebble
mass flux. Our results imply that the opacity of a forming planetary envelope
can not be approximated by a value that is constant with either depth or planet
mass. When applied to the Solar System, we argue that Uranus and Neptune could
not have maintained a sufficiently high opacity to avoid runaway gas accretion
unless they both experienced sufficiently rapid accretion of solids and formed
late.

one of the first X-ray and optical analyses of filaments in cool core clusters

processes responsible for the emission arising from these filaments. We
complemented the optical VLT/MUSE observations, tracing the colder gas phase,
with X-ray $\textit{Chandra}$ observations of the hotter highly ionized gas
phase. Using the MUSE observations, we studied the emission line intensity
ratios along the filaments to constrain the physical processes driving the
excitation, and, using the $\textit{Chandra}$ observations, we carried out a
spectral analysis of the gas along these filaments. We found a spatial
association between the X-ray and optical morphology of these filaments, which
are colder and have lower metal abundance than the surrounding intra-cluster
medium (ICM), as already seen in other BCGs. Comparing with previous results
from the literature for other BCGs, we propose that the excitation process that
is most likely responsible for these filaments emission is a combination of
star formation and shocks, with a likely contribution from self-ionizing,
cooling ICM. Additionally, we conclude that the filaments most likely
originated from AGN-driven outflows in the direction of the radio jet.

non-thermal electrons. In this paper we examine the consequences that such a
hybrid (thermal/non-thermal) EED has on the spectrum of blazars. Since the
thermal component of the EED may extend to very low energies. We replace the
standard synchrotron process by the more general magneto-bremsstrahlung (MBS).
Significant differences in the energy flux appear at low radio frequencies when
considering MBS instead of the standard synchrotron emission. A drop in the
spectrum appears in the all the radio band and a prominent valley between the
infrared and soft X-rays bands when a hybrid EED is considered, instead of a
power-law EED. In the $\gamma$-ray band an EED of mostly thermal particles
displays significant differences with respect to the one dominated by
non-thermal particles. A thermally-dominated EED produces a synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC) peak extending only up to a few MeV, and the valley
separating the MBS and the SSC peaks is much deeper than if the EED is
dominated by non-thermal particles. The combination of these effects modifies
the Compton dominance of a blazar, suggesting that the vertical scatter in the
distribution of FSRQs and BL Lac objects in the peak synchrotron frequency -
Compton dominance parameter space could be attributed to different proportions
of thermal/non-thermal particles in the EED of blazars. Finally, the
temperature of the electrons in the shocked plasma is shown to be a degenerated
quantity for different magentizations of the ejected material.

smooth predictions, without being able to incorporate musical information about

hierarchical level such models have been applied to (directly on audio frames)
which prevents learning musical relationships, even for expressive models such
as recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, if applied on the level of chord

disentangle temporal models into a harmonic language model---to be applied on
chord sequences---and a chord duration model that connects the chord-level

central problem in computational statistics and machine learning. This paper
describes discrete particle variational inference (DPVI), a new approach that
combines key strengths of Monte Carlo, variational and search-based techniques.
DPVI is based on a novel family of particle-based variational approximations
that can be fit using simple, fast, deterministic search techniques. Like Monte
Carlo, DPVI can handle multiple modes, and yields exact results in a
well-defined limit. Like unstructured mean-field, DPVI is based on optimizing a
lower bound on the partition function; when this quantity is not of intrinsic
interest, it facilitates convergence assessment and debugging. Like both Monte
Carlo and combinatorial search, DPVI can take advantage of factorization,
sequential structure, and custom search operators. This paper defines DPVI
particle-based approximation family and partition function lower bounds, along
with the sequential DPVI and local DPVI algorithm templates for optimizing
them. DPVI is illustrated and evaluated via experiments on lattice Markov
Random Fields, nonparametric Bayesian mixtures and block-models, and parametric
as well as non-parametric hidden Markov models. Results include applications to
real-world spike-sorting and relational modeling problems, and show that DPVI
can offer appealing time/accuracy trade-offs as compared to multiple
alternatives.

$bc$, joined at $b$, with $ab$ being very long, and $bc$ of some small length
$r$. We investigate a trajectory planning problem involving the articulated
two-segment probe where the length $r$ of $bc$ can be customized. Consider a
set $P$ of simple polygonal obstacles with a total of $n$ vertices, a target
point $t$ located in the free space such that $t$ cannot see to infinity, and a
circle $S$ centered at $t$ enclosing $P$. The probe initially resides outside
$S$, with $ab$ and $bc$ being collinear, and is restricted to the following
sequence of moves: a straight line insertion of $abc$ into $S$ followed by a
rotation of $bc$ around $b$. The goal is to compute a feasible
obstacle-avoiding trajectory for the probe so that, after the sequence of
moves, $c$ coincides with $t$.
  We prove that, for $n$ line segment obstacles, the smallest length $r$ for
which there exists a feasible probe trajectory can be found in
$O(n^{2+\epsilon})$ time using $O(n^{2+\epsilon})$ space, for any constant
$\epsilon > 0$. Furthermore, we prove that all values $r$ for which a feasible

characterized by a simple arrangement of complexity $O(n^2)$, which can be
constructed in $O(n^2)$ time. To obtain our solutions, we design efficient data

to the identities of their users after signing up into their platform, and the
users need to authenticate using the same credentials each time they are
willing to use the service. Likewise, when using in-person services like going
to a concert, after paying for this service the user usually gets a ticket
which proves that he/she has the right to use that service. In both scenarios,
the main concerns are the centralization of the systems, and that they do not
ensure customers' privacy. The involved Service Providers are Trusted Third
Parties, authorities that offer services and handle private data about users.
In this paper, we design and implement FORT, a decentralized system that allows
customers to prove their right to use specific services (either online or
in-person) without revealing sensitive information. To achieve decentralization
we propose a solution where all the data is handled by a Blockchain. We
describe and uniquely identify users' rights using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs),
and possession of these rights is demonstrated by using Zero-Knowledge Proofs,
cryptographic primitives that allow us to guarantee customers' privacy.

variability of softer photons lags behind the variability of harder photons) in
one $XMM-Newton$ observation of the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate AT
2018fyk while the source was in the hard spectral state. The lags are detected
at $6.51\times10^{-5}~\rm Hz$. The amplitude of the lags with respect to
0.5$-$1 keV monotonically decreases with the photon energy, from $\sim 1200~\rm
s$ at 0.3$-$0.5 keV to $\sim -4200~\rm s$ at 3$-$5 keV (in our convention a
positive lag means lagging behind the reference band). We find that the
amplitude is proportional to the logarithm of the energy separation between the
examined band and the reference band. The energy-dependent covariance spectrum
indicates that the correlated variability is more likely to be associated with
the non-thermal radiation. The soft lags are difficult to reconcile with the
reverberation scenario that are used to explain the soft lags in active
galactic nuclei. On the other hand, the observed soft lags are consistent with
the picture that the soft X-rays are down-scattered hard X-rays by the outflow
as predicted by ``unification'' models of TDEs.

in many applications, such as safe and efficient inland navigation, prediction
of bank erosion, land subsidence, and flood risk management. The high cost and
complex logistics of direct bathymetry surveys, i.e., depth imaging, have
encouraged the use of indirect measurements such as surface flow velocities.
However, estimating high-resolution bathymetry from indirect measurements is an
inverse problem that can be computationally challenging. Here, we propose a
reduced-order model (ROM) based approach that utilizes a variational
autoencoder (VAE), a type of deep neural network with a narrow layer in the
middle, to compress bathymetry and flow velocity information and accelerate
bathymetry inverse problems from flow velocity measurements. In our
application, the shallow-water equations (SWE) with appropriate boundary
conditions (BCs), e.g., the discharge and/or the free surface elevation,
constitute the forward problem, to predict flow velocity. Then, ROMs of the
SWEs are constructed on a nonlinear manifold of low dimensionality through a
variational encoder. Estimation with uncertainty quantification (UQ) is
performed on the low-dimensional latent space in a Bayesian setting. We have
tested our inversion approach on a one-mile reach of the Savannah River, GA,
USA. Once the neural network is trained (offline stage), the proposed technique
can perform the inversion operation orders of magnitude faster than traditional
inversion methods that are commonly based on linear projections, such as
principal component analysis (PCA), or the principal component geostatistical
approach (PCGA). Furthermore, tests show that the algorithm can estimate the
bathymetry with good accuracy even with sparse flow velocity measurements.

the degree of specialty or mediocrity of our trajectory of biospheric
evolution, we need to take into account recent advances in theoretical
astrobiology, in particular (i) establishing the history of habitable planets'
formation in the Galaxy, and (ii) understanding the crucial importance of
""Gaian"" feedback loops and temporal windows for the interaction of early life
with its physical environment. Hereby we consider an alternative
macroevolutionary pathway that may result in tight functional integration of
all sub-planetary ecosystems, eventually giving rise to a true superorganism at

working in fundamental particle physics and the physics of hadronic matter at
extreme temperature and density. To sustain and extend its discovery potential,
the LHC will need a major upgrade in the 2020s. This will increase its

implement. The new configuration, known as High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), will
rely on a number of key innovations that push accelerator technology beyond its
present limits. Among these are cutting-edge 11-12 tesla superconducting

  Domain",50 pages,,,,math.OC cs.GT cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We study the problem of finding approximate first-order stationary points in
optimization problems of the form $\min_{x \in X} \max_{y \in Y} f(x,y)$, where
the sets $X,Y$ are convex and $Y$ is compact. The objective function $f$ is
smooth, but assumed neither convex in $x$ nor concave in $y$. Our approach
relies upon replacing the function $f(x,\cdot)$ with its $k$th order Taylor
approximation (in $y$) and finding a near-stationary point in the resulting
surrogate problem. To guarantee its success, we establish the following result:
let the Euclidean diameter of $Y$ be small in terms of the target accuracy
$\varepsilon$, namely $O(\varepsilon^{\frac{2}{k+1}})$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$
and $O(\varepsilon)$ for $k = 0$, with the constant factors controlled by
certain regularity parameters of $f$; then any $\varepsilon$-stationary point
in the surrogate problem remains $O(\varepsilon)$-stationary for the initial
problem. Moreover, we show that these upper bounds are nearly optimal: the
aforementioned reduction provably fails when the diameter of $Y$ is larger. For
$0 \le k \le 2$ the surrogate function can be efficiently maximized in $y$; our
general approximation result then leads to efficient algorithms for finding a
near-stationary point in nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems, for which we
also provide convergence guarantees.

characterization of protein structures. A typical workflow involves acquiring
projection images of a collection of randomly oriented particles, picking and
classifying individual particle projections by orientation, and finally using
the individual particle projections to reconstruct a 3D map of the electron
density profile. The reconstruction is challenging because of the low
signal-to-noise ratio of the data, the unknown orientation of the particles,
and the sparsity of data especially when dealing with flexible proteins where
there may not be sufficient data corresponding to each class to obtain an
accurate reconstruction using standard algorithms. In this paper we present a
model-based image reconstruction technique that uses a regularized cost
function to reconstruct the 3D density map by assuming known orientations for
the particles. Our method casts the reconstruction as minimizing a cost
function involving a novel forward model term that accounts for the contrast
transfer function of the microscope, the orientation of the particles and the
center of rotation offsets. We combine the forward model term with a
regularizer that enforces desirable properties in the volume to be
reconstructed. Using simulated data, we demonstrate how our method can
significantly improve upon the typically used approach.

PPs (Sq-PPs), with octahedral and square arrangements of patches, respectively.
The self-assembly is additionally facilitated by the simulated annealing
procedure. The resultant structures are characterized by a combination of local
correlations in cubatic ordering, and a symmetry-specific variation of bond
orientation order parameters (SymBOPs). By varying the PP/IP size ratio, we
detected a sharp crossover between two distinct morphologies, in both types of
systems. High symmetry phases, NaCl crystal for Oh-PP and square lattice for
Sq-PP, are observed for larger size ratios. For smaller ones, the dominant
morphologies are significantly different, e.g., Oh-PPs form a compact amorphous
structure with predominantly Face-to-Face orientation of neighboring PPs.
Unusually for a morphology without a long range order, it is still possible to
identify well organized coherent clusters of this structure, thanks to the
adoption of our SymBOP-based characterization.

maintaining thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ) (represented by CO2)
simultaneously. This problem is computationally challenging due to the complex
system dynamics, various spatial and temporal couplings as well as multiple
control variables to be coordinated. To address the challenges, we propose a
two-level distributed method (TLDM) with a upper level and lower level control
integrated. The upper level computes zone mass flow rates for maintaining zone
thermal comfort with minimal energy cost, and then the lower level
strategically regulates zone mass flow rates and the ventilation rate to
achieve IAQ while preserving the near energy saving performance of upper level.
As both the upper and lower level computation are deployed in a distributed
manner, the proposed method is scalable and computationally efficient. The
near-optimal performance of the method in energy cost saving is demonstrated
through comparison with the centralized method. In addition, the comparisons
with the existing distributed method show that our method can provide IAQ with
only little increase of energy cost while the latter fails. Moreover, we
demonstrate our method outperforms the demand controlled ventilation strategies

networks to suffice their needs for hydrological and meteorological measurement
data to monitor and model physical processes within catchments. Implementing a
comprehensive monitoring system often suffers from sparse coverage of in-situ
data. Due to the evolvement of the Copernicus satellite platforms, the broader
availability of satellite data provides a great potential for deriving
complementary information from Earth Observation data. Although the number of
satellite data platforms that provide online processing environments is
growing, it is still a big challenge to integrate those platforms into
traditional workflows of users from environmental domains such as hydrology.
Thus, in this paper, we introduce a software architecture to facilitate the
generation of Earth Observation information targeted towards hydrology. The
presented WaCoDiS System comprises several microservices as well standardized
interfaces that enable a platform-independent processing of satellite data.
First, we discuss the contribution of Earth Observation data to water

overview about the different system components which form an automated

recast and extend such a theory, including both higher order terms in the
polinomial laser field expansion and non polinomial corrections due to the
onset of saturation effects in a single cycle. Also, a very accurate model for
predicting the cycle-averaged $3D$ momentum distribution of the extracted

high-quality perovskite thin films, to produce sizable single crystals, and to
synthesize nanoparticles at room temperature. However, a systematic exploration
of the effect of specific antisolvents on the intrinsic stability of
multicomponent metal halide perovskites has yet to be demonstrated. Here, we
develop a high-throughput experimental workflow that incorporates chemical
robotic synthesis, automated characterization, and machine learning techniques
to explore how the choice of antisolvent affects the intrinsic stability of
binary perovskite systems in ambient conditions over time. Different
combinations of the endmembers, MAPbI3, MAPbBr3, FAPbI3, FAPbBr3, CsPbI3, and
CsPbBr3, are used to synthesize 15 combinatorial libraries, each with 96 unique
combinations. In total, roughly 1100 different compositions are synthesized.
Each library is fabricated twice using two different antisolvents: toluene and
chloroform. Once synthesized, photoluminescence spectroscopy is automatically
performed every 5 minutes for approximately 6 hours. Non-negative Matrix
Factorization (NMF) is then utilized to map the time- and
compositional-dependent optoelectronic properties. Through the utilization of
this workflow for each library, we demonstrate that the selection of
antisolvent is critical to the stability of metal halide perovskites in ambient
conditions. We explore possible dynamical processes, such as halide
segregation, responsible for either the stability or eventual degradation as
caused by the choice of antisolvent. Overall, this high-throughput study
demonstrates the vital role that antisolvents play in the synthesis of
high-quality multicomponent metal halide perovskite systems.

ionospheric scintillation taken using the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). The
observation was of the strong natural radio source Cas A, taken overnight on
18-19 August 2013, and exhibited moderately strong scattering effects in
dynamic spectra of intensity received across an observing bandwidth of
10-80MHz. Delay-Doppler spectra (the 2-D FFT of the dynamic spectrum) from the
first hour of observation showed two discrete parabolic arcs, one with a steep
curvature and the other shallow, which can be used to provide estimates of the
distance to, and velocity of, the scattering plasma. A cross-correlation
analysis of data received by the dense array of stations in the LOFAR ""core""
reveals two different velocities in the scintillation pattern: a primary
velocity of ~30m/s with a north-west to south-east direction, associated with
the steep parabolic arc and a scattering altitude in the F-region or higher,
and a secondary velocity of ~110m/s with a north-east to south-west direction,
associated with the shallow arc and a scattering altitude in the D-region.
Geomagnetic activity was low in the mid-latitudes at the time, but a weak
sub-storm at high latitudes reached its peak at the start of the observation.
An analysis of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and ionosonde data
from the time reveals a larger-scale travelling ionospheric disturbance (TID),
possibly the result of the high-latitude activity, travelling in the north-west
to south-east direction, and, simultaneously, a smaller--scale TID travelling
in a north-east to south-west direction, which could be associated with
atmospheric gravity wave activity. The LOFAR observation shows scattering from
both TIDs, at different altitudes and propagating in different directions. To
the best of our knowledge this is the first time that such a phenomenon has
been reported.

Q-functions. Our dropout Q-functions are simple Q-functions equipped with
dropout connection and layer normalization. Despite its simplicity of
implementation, our experimental results indicate that DroQ is doubly (sample

galaxy morphologies in the early universe, measuring galaxy structure can be
challenging. Non-parametric measurements such as the CAS system have thus
become an important tool due to both their model-independent nature and their
utility as a straightforward computational process. Recently, convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be adept at image analysis, and are
beginning to supersede traditional measurements of visual morphology and
model-based structural parameters. In this work, we take a further step by
extending CNNs to measure well known non-parametric structural quantities:
concentration ($C$) and asymmetry ($A$). We train CNNs to predict $C$ and $A$
from individual images of $\sim 150,000$ galaxies at $0 < z < 7$ in the CANDELS
fields, using Bayesian hyperparameter optimisation to select suitable network
architectures. Our resulting networks accurately reproduce measurements
compared with standard algorithms. Furthermore, using simulated images, we show
that our networks are more stable than the standard algorithms at low
signal-to-noise. While both approaches suffer from similar systematic biases
with redshift, these remain small out to $z \sim 7$. Once trained, measurements
with our networks are $> 10^3$ times faster than previous methods. Our approach
is thus able to reproduce standard measures of non-parametric morphologies and
shows the potential of employing neural networks to provide superior results in
substantially less time. This will be vital for making best use of the large
and complex datasets provided by upcoming galaxy surveys, such as Euclid and
Rubin-LSST.

range of responses modelled by a multivariate generalised linear mixed model
(MGLMM). The methodology requires the existence of clusters of observations and
that each of the several responses studied is modelled using a generalised
linear mixed models (GLMM) containing random components representing the
clusters. We construct a MGLMM by assuming that the distribution of each of the
random components representing the clusters is the marginal distribution of a
(sufficiently regular) multivariate elliptically contoured distribution. We use
an undirected graphical model to represent the correlation structure of the
random components representing the clusters of observations for each response.
This representation allows us to draw conclusions regarding unknown underlying
determining factors related to the clusters of observations. Using a
combination of an undirected graph and a directed acyclic graph (DAG), we
jointly represent the correlation structure of the responses and the related
random components. Applying the theory of graphical models allows us to
describe and draw conclusions on the correlation and, in some cases, the
dependence between responses of different statistical nature (\eg following
different distributions, different linear predictors and link functions). We
present some simulation studies illustrating the proposed methodology.

emission has raised the question of the role of shocks in nova eruptions. Here
we use radio observations of nova V809 Cep (Nova Cep 2013) with the Jansky Very
Large Array to show that it produced non-thermal emission indicative of
particle acceleration in strong shocks for more than a month starting about six
weeks into the eruption, quasi-simultaneous with the production of dust.
Broadly speaking, the radio emission at late times -- more than a six months or
so into the eruption -- is consistent with thermal emission from $10^{-4}
M_\odot$ of freely expanding, $10^4$~K ejecta. At 4.6 and 7.4 GHz, however, the
radio light-curves display an initial early-time peak 76 days after the
discovery of the eruption in the optical ($t_0$). The brightness temperature at
4.6 GHz on day 76 was greater than $10^5 K$, an order of magnitude above what
is expected for thermal emission. We argue that the brightness temperature is
the result of synchrotron emission due to internal shocks within the ejecta.
The evolution of the radio spectrum was consistent with synchrotron emission
that peaked at high frequencies before low frequencies, suggesting that the
synchrotron from the shock was initially subject to free-free absorption by
optically thick ionized material in front of the shock. Dust formation began
around day 37, and we suggest that internal shocks in the ejecta were
established prior to dust formation and caused the nucleation of dust.

capture both within-class and between-class knowledge. The relationship
information can be effectively obtained from the self-attention maps in a

learning with weak rules is challenging due to their inherent heuristic and

alternative to labour-intensive cleanroom production. Here, we present 2D metal
micro-particle focusing in a round glass capillary using bulk acoustic waves.
Excitation of the piezoelectric transducer at specific frequencies leads to
mode shapes in the round capillary, concentrating particles towards the
capillary centre. We experimentally investigate the particle linewidth for
different particle materials and concentrations. We demonstrate the focus of
copper particles with 1 $\mu$m in diameter down to a line of width 60.8 $\pm$
7.0 $\mu$m and height 45.2 $\pm$ 9.3 $\mu$m, corresponding to a local
concentration of 4.5 % v/v, which is 90 times higher than the concentration of
the initial solution. Through numerical analysis, we could obtain further
insights into the particle manipulation mechanism inside the capillary and
predict the particle trajectories. We found that a transition of the acoustic
streaming pattern enables us to manipulate particles close to the critical
particle radius. Finally, we used our method to eject copper particles through
a tapered round capillary with an opening of 25 $\mu$m in diameter, which would

lacking a theoretical understanding of how pruning affects DNs' decision
boundary, how to interpret pruning, and how to design corresponding principled
pruning techniques. To tackle those questions, we propose to employ recent
advances in the theoretical analysis of Continuous Piecewise Affine (CPA) DNs.
From this perspective, we will be able to detect the early-bird (EB) ticket
phenomenon, provide interpretability into current pruning techniques, and
develop a principled pruning strategy. In each step of our study, we conduct
extensive experiments supporting our claims and results; while our main goal is
to enhance the current understanding towards DN pruning instead of developing a
new pruning method, our spline pruning criteria in terms of layerwise and
global pruning is on par with or even outperforms state-of-the-art pruning
methods.

and sensor applications; however, research on their charge and spin transport
properties in a thin film form is less explored. Herein, we report the
temperature and magnetic field dependent charge transport properties of a
highly crystalline MnP nanorod thin film over a wide temperature range (2-350
K). The MnP nanorod films of 100 nm thickness were grown on Si substrates at
500 oC using molecular beam epitaxy. The temperature dependent resistivity data
exhibits a metallic behavior over the entire measured temperature range.
However, large negative magnetoresistance of up to 12% is observed below 50 K
at which the system enters a stable helical (screw) magnetic state. In this
temperature regime, the MR(H,T) dependence seems to show a magnetic field
manipulated phase coexistence. The observed magnetoresistance is dominantly
governed by the intergranular spin dependent tunneling mechanism. These
findings pinpoint a correlation between the transport and magnetism in this
helimagnetic system.

key problem in reinforcement learning (RL), where sample inefficiency has posed
serious challenges for practical applications. Recent works have shown that
using expressive policy function approximators and conditioning on future
trajectory information -- such as future states in hindsight experience replay
or returns-to-go in Decision Transformer (DT) -- enables efficient learning of
multi-task policies, where at times online RL is fully replaced by offline
behavioral cloning, e.g. sequence modeling. We demonstrate that all these
approaches are doing hindsight information matching (HIM) -- training policies
that can output the rest of trajectory that matches some statistics of future
state information. We present Generalized Decision Transformer (GDT) for
solving any HIM problem, and show how different choices for the feature
function and the anti-causal aggregator not only recover DT as a special case,
but also lead to novel Categorical DT (CDT) and Bi-directional DT (BDT) for
matching different statistics of the future. For evaluating CDT and BDT, we
define offline multi-task state-marginal matching (SMM) and imitation learning
(IL) as two generic HIM problems, propose a Wasserstein distance loss as a
metric for both, and empirically study them on MuJoCo continuous control
benchmarks. CDT, which simply replaces anti-causal summation with anti-causal
binning in DT, enables the first effective offline multi-task SMM algorithm
that generalizes well to unseen and even synthetic multi-modal state-feature
distributions. BDT, which uses an anti-causal second transformer as the
aggregator, can learn to model any statistics of the future and outperforms DT
variants in offline multi-task IL. Our generalized formulations from HIM and
GDT greatly expand the role of powerful sequence modeling architectures in
modern RL.

resolution-enhanced (RE)-OCT navigates the exchange of information between

suppression via coherent averaging and a simple computational bandwidth
expansion procedure. We demonstrate a resolution enhancement of 1.5 times

to an expanded framework of information capacity and resolution in coherent

thickness. HIP (Heterogeneity in Integration and Prediction) accounts for
subgroup heterogeneity, allows for sparsity in variable selection, is

feedback model within Enzo to match simulations. The parameters that are
adjusted include the star formation efficiency, coupling of thermal energy from
stellar feedback, and volume into which the energy is deposited. This number
translates to a factor of more than three improvements over manual calibration.
Despite using fewer simulations, we obtain a better agreement to the observed
baryon makeup of a Milky-Way (MW) sized halo. Switching to a different
strategy, we improve the consistency of the recommended parameters from the

reconcile metal transport between grid-based and particle-based simulation

the number of paths that exist between each couple of nodes; hence, we propose
three basic topologies to show this parameter. This paper is useful for those

Reinforcement Learning (MRAC-RL) approach to developing online policies for
systems in which modeling errors occur in real-time. Although reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithms have been successfully used to develop control
policies for dynamical systems, discrepancies between simulated dynamics and
the true target dynamics can cause trained policies to fail to generalize and
adapt appropriately when deployed in the real-world. The MRAC-RL framework
generates online policies by utilizing an inner-loop adaptive controller
together with a simulation-trained outer-loop RL policy. This structure allows
MRAC-RL to adapt and operate effectively in a target environment, even when
parametric uncertainties exists. We propose a set of novel MRAC algorithms,
apply them to a class of nonlinear systems, derive the associated control laws,
provide stability guarantees for the resulting closed-loop system, and show
that the adaptive tracking objective is achieved. Using a simulation study of
an automated quadrotor landing task, we demonstrate that the MRAC-RL approach
improves upon state-of-the-art RL algorithms and techniques through the
generation of online policies.

We further demonstrate that the revealed disciplinary clusters inform economic

explicitly represents the evolving probability density of bubble radii and
radial velocities. Conditional quadrature-based moment methods (QBMMs) are
adapted to solve this PBE. A one-way-coupled bubble dynamics problem
demonstrates the efficacy of different QBMMs for the evolving bubble
statistics. Results show that enforcing hyperbolicity during moment inversion
(CHyQMOM) provides comparable model-form accuracy to the traditional
conditional method of moments and decreases computational costs by about ten
times for a broad range of test cases. The CHyQMOM-based computational model is
implemented in MFC, an open-source multi-phase and high-order-accurate flow
solver. We assess the effect of the model and its parameters on a two-way

unsupervised image anomaly detection. However, there is no guarantee that the
surrogate tasks share the consistent optimization direction with anomaly
detection. In this paper, we return to a direct objective function for anomaly
detection with information theory, which maximizes the distance between normal
and anomalous data in terms of the joint distribution of images and their
representation. Unfortunately, this objective function is not directly
optimizable under the unsupervised setting where no anomalous data is provided
during training. Through mathematical analysis of the above objective function,
we manage to decompose it into four components. In order to optimize in an
unsupervised fashion, we show that, under the assumption that distribution of
the normal and anomalous data are separable in the latent space, its lower
bound can be considered as a function which weights the trade-off between
mutual information and entropy. This objective function is able to explain why
the surrogate task based methods are effective for anomaly detection and
further point out the potential direction of improvement. Based on this object
function we introduce a novel information theoretic framework for unsupervised
image anomaly detection. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the
proposed framework significantly outperforms several state-of-the-arts on

generated by a subset of the other observed variables as well as a subset of
the exogenous sources -- are pervasive in causal inference and casual
discovery. However, for the task of causal discovery, existing work almost
exclusively focus on the submodel where each observed variable is associated
with a distinct source with non-zero variance. This results in the restriction
that no observed variable can deterministically depend on other observed
variables or latent confounders. In this paper, we extend the results on
structure learning by focusing on a subclass of linear SCMs which do not have
this property, i.e., models in which observed variables can be causally
affected by any subset of the sources, and are allowed to be a deterministic
function of other observed variables or latent confounders. This allows for a
more realistic modeling of influence or information propagation in systems. We
focus on the task of causal discovery form observational data generated from a
member of this subclass. We derive a set of necessary and sufficient conditions
for unique identifiability of the causal structure. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that gives identifiability results for causal
discovery under both latent confounding and deterministic relationships.
Further, we propose an algorithm for recovering the underlying causal structure
when the aforementioned conditions are satisfied. We validate our theoretical
results both on synthetic and real datasets.

achieved unprecedented performance in upscaling frames with unknown
degradation. These models are able to accurately estimate the unknown
downscaling kernel from a given low-resolution (LR) image in order to leverage
the kernel during restoration. Although these approaches have largely been
successful, they are predominantly image-based and therefore do not exploit the
temporal properties of the kernels across multiple video frames. In this paper,
we investigated the temporal properties of the kernels and highlighted its
importance in the task of blind video super-resolution. Specifically, we
measured the kernel temporal consistency of real-world videos and illustrated
how the estimated kernels might change per frame in videos of varying
dynamicity of the scene and its objects. With this new insight, we revisited
previous popular video SR approaches, and showed that previous assumptions of
using a fixed kernel throughout the restoration process can lead to visual
artifacts when upscaling real-world videos. In order to counteract this, we
tailored existing single-image and video SR techniques to leverage kernel
consistency during both kernel estimation and video upscaling processes.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world videos show substantial
restoration gains quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving the new
state-of-the-art in blind video SR and underlining the potential of exploiting
kernel temporal consistency.

shed light on the nature of dark matter. However, it is a challenging task,
which traditionally requires detailed lens modeling and source reconstruction,
taking weeks to analyze each system. We use machine-learning to circumvent the
need for lens and source modeling and develop a neural network to both locate
subhalos in an image as well as determine their mass using the technique of
image segmentation. The network is trained on images with a single subhalo
located near the Einstein ring across a wide range of apparent source
magnitudes. The network is then able to resolve subhalos with masses $m\gtrsim
10^{8.5} M_{\odot}$. Training in this way allows the network to learn the
gravitational lensing of light, and remarkably, it is then able to detect
entire populations of substructure, even for locations further away from the
Einstein ring than those used in training. Over a wide range of the apparent
source magnitude, the false-positive rate is around three false subhalos per
100 images, coming mostly from the lightest detectable subhalo for that
signal-to-noise ratio. With good accuracy and a low false-positive rate,
counting the number of pixels assigned to each subhalo class over multiple

discoveries. However, the vast majority of the tens of millions of radio
galaxies won't have the spectroscopic redshift measurements required for a
large number of science cases. Here, we evaluate techniques for estimating
redshifts of galaxies from a radio-selected survey. Using a radio-selected
sample with broadband photometry at infrared and optical wavelengths, we test
the k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) and Random Forest machine learning algorithms,
testing them both in their regression and classification modes. Further, we
test different distance metrics used by the kNN algorithm, including the
standard Euclidean distance, the Mahalanobis distance and a learned distance
metric for both the regression mode (the Metric Learning for Kernel Regression
metric) and the classification mode (the Large Margin Nearest Neighbour
metric). We find that all regression-based modes fail on galaxies at a redshift
$z > 1$. However, below this range, the kNN algorithm using the Mahalanobis
distance metric performs best, with an $\eta_{0.15}$ outlier rate of 5.85\%. In
the classification mode, the kNN algorithm using the Mahalanobis distance
metric also performs best, with an $\eta_{0.15}$ outlier rate of 5.85\%,
correctly placing 74\% of galaxies in the top $z > 1.02$ bin. Finally, we also
tested the effect of training in one field and applying the trained algorithm
to similar data from another field and found that variation across fields does
not result in statistically significant differences in predicted redshifts.
Importantly, we find that while we may not be able to predict a continuous
value for high-redshift radio sources, we can identify the majority of them
using the classification modes of existing techniques.

(GW) emission has reopened the exciting possibility that dark matter is made,
at least partly, of primordial black holes (PBHs). However, this scenario is
challenged by many observational probes that set bounds on the relative PBH
abundance across a broad range of viable PBH masses. Among these bounds, the
ones coming from microlensing surveys lead to the strongest constraints in the
mass range from $\sim 10^{-10}$ to a few M$_{\odot}$. The upper part of this
range precisely corresponds to the mass window inside which the formation of
PBHs should be boosted due to the QCD phase transition in the early Universe,
which makes the microlensing probes particularly important. However, it has
been argued that taking into account the inevitable clustering of PBH on small
scales can significantly relax or entirely remove these bounds. While the
impact of PBH clustering on the GW event rate has been studied in detail, its
impact on the microlensing event rate has not yet been fully assessed. In this
Letter, we address this issue, and show that clusters arising from isocurvature
perturbations, that originating from PBHs formed from Gaussian initial
curvature perturbations, do not alter the current microlensing constraints, as
they are not sufficiently compact.

bodies. Regolith production via impact cratering has long been a key topic of
study since the Apollo era. The evolution of regolith due to impact cratering,
however, is not well understood. A better formulation is needed to help
quantify the formation mechanism and timescale of regolith evolution. Here, we
propose an analytically derived stochastic model that describes the evolution
of regolith generated by small, simple craters. We account for ejecta
blanketing as well as regolith infilling of the transient crater cavity. Our
results show that the regolith infilling plays a key role in producing
regolith. Our model demonstrates that, because of the stochastic nature of
impact cratering, the regolith thickness varies laterally, which is consistent
with earlier work. We apply this analytical model to the regolith evolution at
the Apollo 15 site. The regolith thickness is computed considering the observed
crater size-frequency distribution of small, simple lunar craters (< 381 m in
radius for ejecta blanketing and < 100 m in radius for the regolith infilling).
Allowing for some amount of regolith coming from the outside of the area, our
result is consistent with an empirical result from the Apollo 15 seismic
experiment. Finally, we find that the timescale of regolith growth is longer
than that of crater equilibrium, implying that even if crater equilibrium is
observed on a cratered surface, it is likely the regolith thickness is still
evolving due to additional impact craters.

illustrated and evaluated in this study. On CT data set acquired for breast
treatment, six different RTDP tangential techniques were performed: (i)
three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) with physical wedge, (ii)
3DCRT with virtual wedge, (iii) motion management technique (MMT) with physical
wedge, (iv) MMT with virtual wedge, (v) 3DCRT with field-in-field, and (vi)
intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with direct aperture optimization.
These anti-motion techniques were considered to generate continuous dose
degradation to avoid drastic changes in the delivered doses that involve the
edge regions of the beams. A comparison was made between the delivered and
simulated doses, with and without the presence of motions simulations. This
study demonstrates that techniques without motion management can be affected by
motions that can lead to a difference equal to 19 % between the delivered and
the planned doses in a point located near to the beams collimators edges, and
to a difference up to 3 % on multi-leaf collimators (MLCs) edges (gamma pass
rates were 87.9 % for 3%/3mm). These differences were reduced to 11 % and to
less than 3 % (gamma pass rates were 100 % for 3%/3mm) when MMT were used. As a
conclusion, in tangential techniques motion can affect dose estimations on the
MLCs and beams collimators edges. The proposed MMT reduce this effect to
estimate the delivered dose accurately.

instability supernova (GRSN) from the 55,500 Msun primordial (Population III)
star. Supermassive stars exceeding 1e4 Msun may exist in the early Universe.
They are generally considered to collapse through the general relativistic
instability to be seed black holes to form supermassive (~ 1e9 Msun) black
holes observed as high-redshift quasars. Some of them, however, may explode as
GRSNe if the explosive helium burning unbinds the supermassive stars following
the collapse triggered by the general relativistic instability. We perform the
radiation hydrodynamics simulation of the GRSN starting shortly before the
shock breakout. We find that the GRSN is characterized by a long-lasting (550
d) luminous (1.5e44 erg/s) plateau phase with the photospheric temperature of
around 5000 K in the rest frame. The plateau phase lasts for decades when it
appears at high redshifts and it will likely be observed as a persistent source
in the future deep near-infrared imaging surveys. Especially, the near-infrared
images reaching 29 AB magnitude that can be obtained by Galaxy and Reionization
EXplorer (G-REX) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allow us to identify
GRSNe up to z ~ 15. Deeper images enable us to discover GRSNe at even higher
redshifts. Having extremely red color, they can be distinguished from other
persistent sources such as high-redshift galaxies by using color information.
We conclude that the deep near-infrared images are able to constrain the
existence of GRSNe from the primordial supermassive stars in the Universe even
without the time domain information.

  We are interested in extending this result to the quantum setting. We prove
extensions to the classes Merlin-Arthur MA and Quantum-Classical-Merlin-Arthur
QCMA. Our results have implications for the complexity of approximating the
ground state energy of a quantum local Hamiltonian with a unique ground state
and an inverse polynomial spectral gap. We show that the estimation (to within
polynomial accuracy) of the ground state energy of poly-gapped 1-D local
Hamiltonians is QCMA-hard [AN02], under randomized reductions. This is in stark
contrast to the case of constant gapped 1-D Hamiltonians, which is in NP
[Has07]. Moreover, it shows that unless QCMA can be reduced to NP by randomized
reductions, there is no classical description of the ground state of every
poly-gapped local Hamiltonian that allows efficient calculation of expectation
values.
  Finally, we discuss a few of the obstacles to the establishment of an
analogous result to the class Quantum-Merlin-Arthur (QMA). In particular, we
show that random projections fail to provide a polynomial gap between two
witnesses.

Despite the recent discovery of spiral-shaped features in
protoplanetary discs in the near-infrared and millimetric wavelengths, there is
still an active discussion to understand how they formed. In fact, the spiral
waves observed in discs around young stars can be due to different physical
mechanisms: planet/companion torques, gravitational perturbations or
illumination effects. Aims. We study the spirals formed in the gaseous phase
due to two diametrically opposed shadows cast at fixed disc locations. The
shadows are created by an inclined non-precessing disc inside the cavity, which
is assumed to be optically thick. In particular, we analyse the effect of these
spirals on the dynamics of the dust particles and discuss their detectability
in transition discs. Methods. We perform gaseous hydrodynamical simulations
with shadows, then we compute the dust evolution on top of the gaseous
distribution, and finally we produce synthetic ALMA observations of the dust
emission based on radiative transfer calculations. Results. Our main finding is
that mm- to cm-sized dust particles are efficiently trapped inside the
shadow-triggered spirals. We also observe that particles of various sizes
starting at different stellocentric distances are well mixed inside these
pressure maxima. This dynamical effect would favour grain growth and affect the
resulting composition of planetesimals in the disc. In addition, our radiative
transfer calculations show spiral patterns in the disc at 1.6 {\mu}m and 1.3
mm. Due to their faint thermal emission (compared to the bright inner regions
of the disc) the spirals cannot be detected with ALMA. Our synthetic

image classification. This framework includes an ensemble of CNNs for model
uncertainty, a supervised reconstruction auto-encoder to capture distributional
uncertainty and using the output of activation functions in the last layer of

their iterative nature and the need to recompute the structural properties used
to split the network (i.e. edge betweenness in Girvan and Newman's algorithm),
make them unsuitable for large network data sets. In this paper, we study how
local structural network properties can be used as proxies to improve the
efficiency of hierarchical community detection while, at the same time,
achieving competitive results in terms of modularity. In particular, we study
the potential use of the structural properties commonly used to perform local

relevant, as nodes are prone to establish new links with other nodes within
their communities. In addition, we check the performance impact of network
pruning heuristics as an ancillary tactic to make hierarchical community

solutions for binary sources will become available. We investigate how many
black holes (BH) with massive main-sequence dwarf companions (OB+BH binaries)
are expected to be detected as binaries in DR3 and at the end of the nominal
5-yr mission (DR4). We estimate the fraction of identifiable OB+BH binaries and
discuss the distributions of the masses of both components and the orbital
periods. We study the impact of different BH-formation scenarios. Using
tailored models for the massive star population, which assume a direct collapse
and no kick upon BH formation (the fiducial case), we estimate the fraction of
OB+BH systems that Gaia will detect as binaries. A distance distribution
according to that of the second Alma Luminous Star catalogue (ALSII) is
assumed. We investigate how many of the systems detected as binaries are
identifiable as OB+BH binaries, using a method based on astrometric data. In
the fiducial case we conservatively estimate that 77% of the OB+BH binaries in
ALSII will be detected as binaries in DR3, of which 89% are identifiable as
OB+BH binaries. This leads to a total of around 190 OB+BH binaries, a 20-fold
increase in the known sample of OB+BH binaries, covering an uncharted parameter
space of long-period binaries. The size and properties of the identifiable
OB+BH population will contain crucial observational constraints to improve our
understanding of BH formation. In DR4, the detected fraction will increase to
85%, of which 82% will be identifiable. Hence, an additional ~5 systems could
be identified, which are expected to have either very short or long periods.

method for nonlinear regression and classification. They can be implemented in
either their primal or dual form. The latter requires solving a linear system,
which can be advantageous as an explicit mapping of the data to a possibly
infinite-dimensional feature space is avoided. However, for large-scale
applications, current low-rank approximation methods can perform inadequately.
For example, current methods are probabilistic due to their sampling
procedures, and/or suffer from a poor trade-off between the ranks and
approximation power. In this paper, a recursive Bayesian filtering framework
based on tensor networks and the Kalman filter is presented to alleviate the
demanding memory and computational complexities associated with solving
large-scale dual problems. The proposed method is iterative, does not require
explicit storage of the kernel matrix, and allows the formulation of early
stopping conditions. Additionally, the framework yields confidence estimates of
obtained models, unlike alternative methods. The performance is tested on two
regression and three classification experiments, and compared to the Nystr\""om
and fixed size LS-SVM methods. Results show that our method can achieve high
performance and is particularly useful when alternative methods are
computationally infeasible due to a slowly decaying kernel matrix spectrum.

web servers to easily remembered names. When it was initially created, security
was not a major concern; nowadays, this lack of inherent security and trust has
exposed the global DNS infrastructure to malicious actors. The passive DNS data
collection process creates a database containing various DNS data elements,
some of which are personal and need to be protected to preserve the privacy of
the end users. To this end, we propose the use of distributed ledger
technology. We use Hyperledger Fabric to create a permissioned blockchain,
which only authorized entities can access. The proposed solution supports
queries for storing and retrieving data from the blockchain ledger, allowing
the use of the passive DNS database for further analysis, e.g. for the
identification of malicious domain names. Additionally, it effectively protects
the DNS personal data from unauthorized entities, including the administrators
that can act as potential malicious insiders, and allows only the data owners
to perform queries over these data. We evaluated our proposed solution by
creating a proof-of-concept experimental setup that passively collects DNS data
from a network and then uses the distributed ledger technology to store the
data in an immutable ledger, thus providing a full historical overview of all
the records.

Online Bipartite Matching and Online Submodular Bipartite Matching. We show

and localization neural networks, Mask R-CNN and YOLO (You Only Look Once), for
seed phenotyping using Tensorflow. One of the major bottlenecks of such an

multitude of seed images is taunting, the images are also required to be
annotated to indicate the boundaries of the seeds on the image and converted to
data formats that the neural networks are able to consume. Although tools to
manually perform the task of annotation are available for free, the amount of
time required is enormous. In order to tackle such a scenario, the idea of
domain randomization i.e. the technique of applying models trained on images

transfer learning i.e. the idea of applying the knowledge obtained while
solving a problem to a different problem, is used. The networks are trained on
pre-trained weights from the popular ImageNet and COCO data sets. As part of

Gradient Descent"" (MGA-MSGD) training algorithm that considerably improves
accuracy and efficiency of solving 3D mechanical problems described, in
strong-form, by PDEs via ANNs (Artificial Neural Networks). This presented
approach allows the selection of a number of locations of interest at which the
state variables are expected to fulfil the governing equations associated with
a physical problem. Unlike classical PDE approximation methods such as finite
differences or the finite element method, there is no need to establish and
reconstruct the physical field quantity throughout the computational domain in
order to predict the mechanical response at specific locations of interest. The
basic idea of MGA-MSGD is the manipulation of the learnable parameters'
components responsible for the error explosion so that we can train the network
with relatively larger learning rates which avoids trapping in local minima.
The proposed training approach is less sensitive to the learning rate value,
training points density and distribution, and the random initial parameters.
The distance function to minimise is where we introduce the PDEs including any
physical laws and conditions (so-called, Physics Informed ANN). The Genetic
algorithm is modified to be suitable for this type of ANN in which a
Coarse-level Stochastic Gradient Descent (CSGD) is exploited to make the
decision of the offspring qualification. Employing the presented approach, a
considerable improvement in both accuracy and efficiency, compared with
standard training algorithms such as classical SGD and Adam optimiser, is
observed. The local displacement accuracy is studied and ensured by introducing
the results of Finite Element Method (FEM) at sufficiently fine mesh as the
reference displacements. A slightly more complex problem is solved ensuring its
feasibility.

data relative to this baseline exhibit ""effective robustness"" and are
exceedingly rare. Identifying such models, and understanding their properties,
is key to improving out-of-distribution performance. We conduct a thorough
empirical investigation of effective robustness during fine-tuning and
surprisingly find that models pre-trained on larger datasets exhibit effective
robustness during training that vanishes at convergence. We study how
properties of the data influence effective robustness, and we show that it
increases with the larger size, more diversity, and higher example difficulty
of the dataset. We also find that models that display effective robustness are
able to correctly classify 10% of the examples that no other current testbed

calibrations between O/H abundance and strong emission-lines for Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) as well as on photoionization models built with the

abundance gradient extrapolations, AGN calibrations, AGN and p-AGB
photoionization models produce similar O/H values for the UGC4805 nucleus and
similar ionization parameter values.
  The study demonstrated that the methods used to estimate the O/H abundance
using nuclear emission-line ratios produce reliable results, which are in
agreement with the O/H values obtained from the independent method of galactic
metallicity gradient extrapolation. Finally, the results from the WHAN diagram
combined with the fact that the high excitation level of the gas has to be

systematic error called confirmation bias, has long been an integral part of
data analysis in many research areas. In cosmology, blind analysis is recently
making its entrance, as the field progresses into a fully fledged
high-precision science. The credibility, reliability and robustness of results
from future sky-surveys will dramatically increase if the effect of
confirmation bias is kept under control by using an appropriate blinding
procedure. Here, we present a catalog-level blinding scheme for galaxy
clustering data apt to be used in future spectroscopic galaxy surveys. We shift
the individual galaxy positions along the line of sight based on 1) a geometric
shift mimicking the Alcock-Paczynski effect and 2) a perturbative shift akin to
redshift-space distortions. This procedure has several advantages. After
combining the two steps above, it is almost impossible to accidentally unblind.
The procedure induces a shift in cosmological parameters without changing the
galaxies' angular positions, hence without interfering with the effects of
angular systematics. Since the method is applied at catalog level, there is no
need to adopt several blinding schemes tuned to different summary statistics,
likelihood choices or types of analyses. By testing the method on mock catalogs
and the BOSS DR12 catalog we demonstrate its performance in blinding galaxy
clustering data for relevant cosmological parameters sensitive to the
background expansion rate and the growth rate of structures.

target face in an image. Existing approaches usually crop the target face from
the input image with respect to a bounding box calculated during
pre-processing, and thus can only parse inner facial Regions of
Interest~(RoIs). Peripheral regions like hair are ignored and nearby faces that
are partially included in the bounding box can cause distractions. Moreover,
these methods are only trained and evaluated on near-frontal portrait images
and thus their performance for in-the-wild cases has been unexplored. To
address these issues, this paper makes three contributions. First, we introduce
iBugMask dataset for face parsing in the wild, which consists of 21,866
training images and 1,000 testing images. The training images are obtained by
augmenting an existing dataset with large face poses. The testing images are
manually annotated with $11$ facial regions and there are large variations in
sizes, poses, expressions and background. Second, we propose RoI Tanh-polar
transform that warps the whole image to a Tanh-polar representation with a
fixed ratio between the face area and the context, guided by the target
bounding box. The new representation contains all information in the original
image, and allows for rotation equivariance in the convolutional neural
networks~(CNNs). Third, we propose a hybrid residual representation learning
block, coined HybridBlock, that contains convolutional layers in both the
Tanh-polar space and the Tanh-Cartesian space, allowing for receptive fields of
different shapes in CNNs. Through extensive experiments, we show that the
proposed method improves the state-of-the-art for face parsing in the wild and
does not require facial landmarks for alignment.

crucial to ensure such systems do not become mechanisms of unfair

Moreover, due to the inherent trade-off between fairness measures and accuracy,
it is desirable to learn fairness-enhanced models without significantly
compromising the accuracy. In this paper, we propose Pareto efficient Fairness
(PEF) as a suitable fairness notion for supervised learning, that can ensure
the optimal trade-off between overall loss and other fairness criteria. The
proposed PEF notion is definition-agnostic, meaning that any well-defined
notion of fairness can be reduced to the PEF notion. To efficiently find a PEF
classifier, we cast the fairness-enhanced classification as a bilevel
optimization problem and propose a gradient-based method that can guarantee the
solution belongs to the Pareto frontier with provable guarantees for convex and
non-convex objectives. We also generalize the proposed algorithmic solution to
extract and trace arbitrary solutions from the Pareto frontier for a given
preference over accuracy and fairness measures. This approach is generic and
can be generalized to any multicriteria optimization problem to trace points on
the Pareto frontier curve, which is interesting by its own right. We
empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the PEF solution and the extracted
Pareto frontier on real-world datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

amounts of expert demonstrations for a given task. While methods for collecting
human demonstrations are becoming easier with teleoperation methods and the use
of low-cost assistive tools, we often still require 100-1000 demonstrations for
every task to learn a visual representation and policy. To address this, we
turn to an alternate form of data that does not require task-specific
demonstrations -- play. Playing is a fundamental method children use to learn a
set of skills and behaviors and visual representations in early learning.
Importantly, play data is diverse, task-agnostic, and relatively cheap to
obtain. In this work, we propose to use playful interactions in a
self-supervised manner to learn visual representations for downstream tasks. We
collect 2 hours of playful data in 19 diverse environments and use
self-predictive learning to extract visual representations. Given these
representations, we train policies using imitation learning for two downstream
tasks: Pushing and Stacking. We demonstrate that our visual representations
generalize better than standard behavior cloning and can achieve similar
performance with only half the number of required demonstrations. Our
representations, which are trained from scratch, compare favorably against
ImageNet pretrained representations. Finally, we provide an experimental
analysis on the effects of different pretraining modes on downstream task
learning.

encryption scheme with the following attractive feature: given a ciphertext, an
adversary cannot create two ciphertexts both of which decrypt to the same
message as the original ciphertext. We revisit this notion and show the
following:
  - Reusability: The constructions proposed by Broadbent and Lord have the
disadvantage that they either guarantee one-time security (that is, the
encryption key can only be used once to encrypt the message) in the plain model
or they guaranteed security in the random oracle model. We construct unclonable
encryption schemes with semantic security. We present two constructions (for
public-key and private-key settings) from minimal cryptographic assumptions.
  - Lower Bound and Generalized Construction: We revisit the
information-theoretic one-time secure construction of Broadbent and Lord. The
success probability of the adversary in their construction was guaranteed to be
$0.85^n$, where $n$ is the length of the message. It was interesting to
understand whether the ideal success probability of (negligibly close to)
$0.5^n$ was unattainable. We generalize their construction to be based on a
broader class of monogamy of entanglement games. We demonstrate a simple
cloning attack that succeeds with probability $0.71^n$ against a class of
schemes including that of Broadbent and Lord. We also present a $0.75^n$
cloning attack exclusively against their scheme.
  - Implication to Copy-Protection: We show that unclonable encryption,
satisfying a stronger property, called unclonable-indistinguishability (defined
by Broadbent and Lord), implies copy-protection for a simple class of
unlearnable functions. While we currently don't have encryption schemes
satisfying this stronger property, this implication demonstrates a new path to
construct copy-protection.

semantic space and predict the links between them. The embedding vectors
themselves contain rich semantic information and can be used in other

embedding vectors themselves vary greatly, making it difficult to understand

ineffectively or incorrectly, particularly for complicated models, such as CP,

domain-specific forecasts from influenza outbreaks, we applied parametric
forecast combination methods that simultaneously optimize individual model
weights and calibrate the ensemble via a beta transformation. We used the
beta-transformed linear pool and the finite beta mixture model to produce
ensemble forecasts retrospectively for the 2016/2017 to 2018/2019 influenza

the FluSight challenge, namely the equally weighted linear pool and the linear
pool. Ensemble forecasts produced from methods with a beta transformation were
shown to outperform those from the equally weighted linear pool and the linear
pool for all week-ahead targets across in the test seasons based on average log
scores. We observed improvements in overall accuracy despite the
beta-transformed linear pool or beta mixture methods' modest under-prediction

in the axial direction. We obtain a simple linear criterion that determines
whether the infinite-cylinder assumption can be employed. The curvature of the

help break the degeneracy between the mass and redshift of the gravitational

this paper, we study extensively different aspects of this approach, including
its computational limits and achievable accuracy. We focus on ground-based
detectors with current and future sensitivities, we first perform the analysis
of an extensive set of simulated data with a hierarchical Bayesian scheme
inferring population and cosmological parameters. We consider a population
model (power-law plus Gaussian) which exhibits characteristic scales (extremes
of the mass spectrum, presence of an accumulation point) that allows an
indirect estimate of the source redshift. Our analysis of this catalog
highlights and quantifies the tight interplay between source population and
cosmological parameters, as well as the influence of initial assumptions
(whether formulated on the source or cosmological parameters). We then validate
our results by an ""end-to-end"" analysis using simulated GW data and posterior
samples generated from Bayesian samplers used for GW parameter estimation, thus
mirroring the analysis chain used for observational data for the first time in
literature. Our results then lead us to re-examine the estimation of $H_0$
obtained with GWTC-1, and we show explicitly how population assumptions impact
the final $H_0$ result. Our results underline the importance of inferring
population and cosmological parameters jointly (and not separately as is often
assumed). The only exception, as we discuss, is if an electromagnetic
counterpart was to be observed for all the BBH events: then the population
assumptions have less impact on the estimation of cosmological parameters.

  localization and Zeno effect",,,,,quant-ph cond-mat.stat-mech,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We address here the issue of quantum measurement in which the interaction
between the system at hand and the measuring apparatus causes a collapse of the
wave function or the density operator. The analysis is carried out for the
prototypical tight-binding chain involving a quantum particle hopping between
nearest-neighbour sites on a lattice, with the system subject to repeated
projective measurements to a detector site. However, unlike previous work, the
measurements are performed at random times. In the absence of measurement, the
particle while starting from a site is known to spread out to farther sites as
time progresses, leading to complete delocalization of the particle in time. In
presence of measurements, we derive exact results for the probability at a
given time for the particle to be found on different sites and averaged with
respect to different realizations of the dynamics. We consider the
representative case in which the time gap between successive measurements are
sampled independently from an exponential distribution. The novel result of our
findings is the revelation of the striking effect of Stochastic Localization,
whereby the particle has at long times time-independent probabilities to be on
different sites. This implies localization of the particle at long times,
achieved through classical stochasticity involved with the random times for
measurements. An extreme case of such localization is attained if the
measurements are done very frequently, when the particle is completely
localized at the detector site! We also point out the stochastic version of the
Zeno effect, whereby dynamical evolution of a quantum system is arrested
through repeated measurements at frequent-enough times. In the wake of recent
experiments on projective measurements at random times achieved through
randomly-pulsed sequences, our proposition is amenable to experimental
realization.

reliable training in real-world contexts.
  The focus on gradients as the primary shared statistic during training has
spawned a number of intuitive algorithms for distributed deep learning;
however, gradient-centric training of large deep neural networks (DNNs) tends
to be communication-heavy, often requiring additional adaptations such as
sparsity constraints, compression, quantization, and more, to curtail
bandwidth.
  We introduce an innovative, communication-friendly approach for training
distributed DNNs, which capitalizes on the outer-product structure of the
gradient as revealed by the mechanics of auto-differentiation. The exposed
structure of the gradient evokes a new class of distributed learning algorithm,
which is naturally more communication-efficient than full gradient sharing. Our
approach, called distributed auto-differentiation (dAD), builds off a marriage
of rank-based compression and the innate structure of the gradient as an
outer-product. We demonstrate that dAD trains more efficiently than other state
of the art distributed methods on modern architectures, such as transformers,
when applied to large-scale text and imaging datasets. The future of
distributed learning, we determine, need not be dominated by gradient-centric

with surface tension, subject to a diverging flow in the gas phase, where the
liquid and the gas phase are both represented as potential fluids. We perform a
Kelvin-Helmholtz-type linear modal stability analysis of the surface to obtain
an amplitude equation that is subsequently analysed in detail and applied to
two cases of interest for impact problems, namely, the parallel impact of a
wave onto a vertical wall, and the impact of a horizontal plate onto a liquid
surface. In both cases we find that long wavelengths are stabilised
considerably in comparison to what may be expected based upon classical
knowledge of the stability of interfaces subject to a constant gas flow. In the
former case, this leads to the prediction of a marginally stable wavelength
that is completely absent in the classical analysis. For the latter we find
much resemblance to the classical case, with the connotation that the
instability is suppressed for smaller disk sizes. The study ends with a
discussion of the influence of gas viscosity and gas compressibility on the

from the moment they leave their outer Solar System reservoirs until their
ejection into interstellar space. We apply a thermal evolution model to a
sample of simulated JFCs obtained from dynamical simulations (arXiv:1706.07447)

that due to the stochastic nature of comet trajectories toward the inner solar

significant modifications of their initial volatile contents. A statistical
analysis constrains the extent of such processing. We suggest that primordial

Hebbian learning, show comparatively poor performance and difficulties of
implementation. Here we show that Hebbian learning in hierarchical,
convolutional neural networks can be implemented almost trivially with modern
deep learning frameworks, by using specific losses whose gradients produce
exactly the desired Hebbian updates. We provide expressions whose gradients
exactly implement a plain Hebbian rule (dw ~= xy), Grossberg's instar rule (dw
~= y(x-w)), and Oja's rule (dw ~= y(x-yw)). As an application, we build Hebbian
convolutional multi-layer networks for object recognition. We observe that
higher layers of such networks tend to learn large, simple features (Gabor-like
filters and blobs), explaining the previously reported decrease in decoding
performance over successive layers. To combat this tendency, we introduce
interventions (denser activations with sparse plasticity, pruning of
connections between layers) which result in sparser learned features, massively
increase performance, and allow information to increase over successive layers.
We hypothesize that more advanced techniques (dynamic stimuli, trace learning,
feedback connections, etc.), together with the massive computational boost
offered by modern deep learning frameworks, could greatly improve the
performance and biological relevance of multi-layer Hebbian networks.

high temporal resolution and their information about what happens in the brain.
Different regions of brain work together to process information and meanwhile
the activity of brain changes during the time. Therefore, the investigation of
the connection between different brain areas and their temporal patterns plays
an important role in neuroscience. In this study, we investigate the emotion
classification performance using functional connectivity features in different
frequency bands and compare them with the classification performance using
differential entropy feature, which has been previously used for this task.
Moreover, we investigate the effect of using different time periods on the
classification performance. Our results on publicly available SEED dataset show
that as time goes on, emotions become more stable and the classification
accuracy increases. Among different time periods, we achieve the highest
classification accuracy using the time period of 140s-end. In this time period,
the accuracy is improved by 4 to 6% compared to using the entire signal. The
mean accuracy of about 88% is obtained using any of the Pearson correlation
coefficient, coherence, and phase locking value features and SVM. Therefore,
functional connectivity features lead to better classification accuracy than DE
features (with the mean accuracy of 84.89%) using the proposed framework.

  Cryptocurrency Market Networks",,,,,cs.DM cs.CR,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have recently gained a lot of
popularity, not only as a digital form of currency but also as an investment
vehicle. Online marketplaces and exchanges allow users across the world to
convert between dozens of different cryptocurrencies and regular currencies
such as euros or dollars. Due to the novelty of this concept, the volatility of
these markets and the differences in maturity and usage of particular
marketplaces, currency pairs may appear at multiple marketplaces but at
different trading prices. This paper proposes a novel algorithmic approach to
take advantage of these mispricings and capitalize upon the pricing differences
that exist between exchanges and currency pairs. To do so, we model each
combination of a currency and a market as one node in a graph. A directed link
between two nodes indicates that a conversion between these two currency/market
pairs is possible. The weight of the link relates to the exchange rate of
executing this particular currency exchange. To leverage the mispricings, we
seek for cycles in the graph such that upon multiplying the weights of the
links in the cycle, a value greater than 1 is found and thus a profit can be
made. Our goal is to do this efficiently, without exhaustively enumerating all
possible cycles in the graph. Therefore, we convert our data and address the
problem in terms of finding minimum weight triangles in graphs with integer
weights, for which efficient algorithms can be utilized. We experiment with
parameter settings (heuristics) related to the conversion of exchange rate data
into integer weight values. We show that our approach improves upon a
reasonable baseline algorithm in terms of computation time. Furthermore, using
a real-world dataset, we demonstrate how the obtained minimal weight cycles
indeed unveil a number of currency exchange cycles that result in a net profit.

addressed with regard to parametric uncertainties, and an adaptive-robust

presented. TARC approximates the unknown dynamics through the time-delayed
estimation, and the adaptive-robust control provides robustness against the
approximation error. The novel adaptation law of TARC, in contrast to the
conventional adaptive-robust control methodologies, requires neither complete
model of the system nor any knowledge of predefined uncertainty bounds to
compute the switching gain, and circumvents the over- and underestimation
problems of the switching gain. Moreover, TARC only utilizes position feedback
and approximates the velocity and acceleration terms from the past position
data. The adopted state-derivatives estimation method in TARC avoids any
explicit requirement of external low pass filters for the removal of

preformed liquid tin targets by several-ns-long 2-$\mu$m-wavelength laser
pulses, are studied in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) regime. In a two-pulse
scheme, a pre-pulse laser is first used to deform tin microdroplets into thin,
extended disks before the main (2$\mu$m) pulse creates the EUV-emitting plasma.
Irradiating 30- to 300-$\mu$m-diameter targets with 2-$\mu$m laser pulses, we
find that the efficiency in creating EUV light around 13.5nm follows the
fraction of laser light that overlaps with the target. Next, the effects of a
change in 2-$\mu$m drive laser intensity (0.6-1.8$\times 10^{11}$W/cm$^2$) and
pulse duration (3.7-7.4ns) are studied. It is found that the angular dependence
of the emission of light within a 2\% bandwidth around 13.5nm and within the
backward 2$\pi$ hemisphere around the incoming laser beam is almost independent
of intensity and duration of the 2-$\mu$m drive laser. With increasing target
diameter, the emission in this 2\% bandwidth becomes increasingly anisotropic,
with a greater fraction of light being emitted into the hemisphere of the
incoming laser beam. For direct comparison, a similar set of experiments is
performed with a 1-$\mu$m-wavelength drive laser. Emission spectra, recorded in
a 5.5-25.5nm wavelength range, show significant self-absorption of light around
13.5nm in the 1-$\mu$m case, while in the 2-$\mu$m case only an opacity-related
broadening of the spectral feature at 13.5nm is observed. This work
demonstrates the enhanced capabilities and performance of 2-$\mu$m-driven
plasmas produced from disk targets when compared to 1-$\mu$m-driven plasmas,
providing strong motivation for the use of 2-$\mu$m lasers as drive lasers in
future high-power sources of EUV light.

  Intelligence",,,,,cs.LG cs.AR cs.RO eess.IV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We propose MC-CIM, a compute-in-memory (CIM) framework for robust, yet low
power, Bayesian edge intelligence. Deep neural networks (DNN) with
deterministic weights cannot express their prediction uncertainties, thereby
pose critical risks for applications where the consequences of mispredictions
are fatal such as surgical robotics. To address this limitation, Bayesian
inference of a DNN has gained attention. Using Bayesian inference, not only the
prediction itself, but the prediction confidence can also be extracted for
planning risk-aware actions. However, Bayesian inference of a DNN is
computationally expensive, ill-suited for real-time and/or edge deployment. An
approximation to Bayesian DNN using Monte Carlo Dropout (MC-Dropout) has shown
high robustness along with low computational complexity. Enhancing the
computational efficiency of the method, we discuss a novel CIM module that can
perform in-memory probabilistic dropout in addition to in-memory weight-input
scalar product to support the method. We also propose a compute-reuse
reformulation of MC-Dropout where each successive instance can utilize the
product-sum computations from the previous iteration. Even more, we discuss how
the random instances can be optimally ordered to minimize the overall
MC-Dropout workload by exploiting combinatorial optimization methods.
Application of the proposed CIM-based MC-Dropout execution is discussed for
MNIST character recognition and visual odometry (VO) of autonomous drones. The
framework reliably gives prediction confidence amidst non-idealities imposed by
MC-CIM to a good extent. Proposed MC-CIM with 16x31 SRAM array, 0.85 V supply,

we extend the conventional MSE training loss with an adversarial loss component
provided by a discriminator network. As for the evaluation, we report various

more hidden layers and regularization techniques, the best model achieving
84.83% accuracy on a test dataset. Using dimensionality reduction done by PCA
we were able to increase that figure to 85.08% with only 10% of the original
feature space, reducing the memory size needed by 64%. Finally, adding methods
to remove possibly harmful training samples like deviation from the mean helped
us to still achieve over 84% test accuracy but with only 32.8% of the original
memory size for the training set. This compares favorably to the majority of
literature results obtained through similar architectures. Although this
approach gets outshined by state-of-the-art models, it does scale to some
(AlexNet, VGGNet) trained on 50% of the same dataset.

2201.13402,Alex Berke,Alex Berke and Dan Calacci,"Privacy Limitations Of Interest-based Advertising On The Web: A
  Post-mortem Empirical Analysis Of Google's FLoC",,,,,cs.CY,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  In 2020, Google announced they would disable third-party cookies in the
Chrome browser in order to improve user privacy. In order to continue to enable
interest-based advertising while mitigating risks of individualized user
tracking, they proposed FLoC. The FLoC algorithm assigns users to ""cohorts""
that represent groups of users with similar browsing behaviors so that
third-parties can serve users ads based on their cohort. In 2022, after testing
FLoC in a real world trial, Google canceled the proposal, with little
explanation, in favor of another way to enable interest-based advertising. In
this work, we offer a post-mortem analysis of how FLoC handled balancing
utility and privacy.
  In particular, we analyze two potential problems raised by privacy advocates:
(1) Contrary to its privacy goals, FLoC enables individual user tracking, and
(2) FLoC risks revealing sensitive user demographic information. We test these
problems by implementing FLoC and compute cohorts for users in a dataset of
browsing histories collected from more than 90,000 U.S. devices over a one-year
period.
  For (1) we investigate the uniqueness of users' cohort ID sequences over
time. We find that more than 95% of user devices are uniquely identifiable
after 4 weeks. We show how these risks increase when cohort IDs are combined
with fingerprinting data. While these risks may be mitigated by frequently
clearing first-party cookies and increasing cohort sizes, such changes would
degrade utility for users and advertisers, respectively. For (2), we find a
statistically significant relationship between domain visits and racial
background, but do not find that FLoC risks correlating cohort IDs with race.
However, alternative clustering techniques could elevate this risk.
  Our contributions provide insights and example analyses for future novel
approaches that seek to protect user privacy while monetizing the web.

active subject of research in the past several decades in hydrology,
geosciences and petroleum engineering. The scale dependence of flow in porous
media is attributed to small- and large-scale heterogeneities, such as pore
size distribution, pore connectivity, long-range correlations, fractures and
faults orientations, and spatial and temporal variations. The main objective of
this study was to investigate how permeability (k) and formation factor (F)
vary with sample dimension at small scales by means of a combination of
pore-network modeling and percolation theory. For this purpose, the
permeability and formation factor were simulated in twelve three-dimensional
pore networks with different levels of pore-scale heterogeneities. Simulations
were carried out at five different network sizes, i.e., 1130, 2250, 3380, 4510
and 6770 microns. Four theoretical models were also developed based on
percolation theory to estimate the scale dependence of permeability and
formation factor from the pore-throat radius distribution. In addition, two
other theoretical scale-dependent permeability models were proposed to estimate
permeability at different scales from the pore-throat radius distribution and
formation factor. Comparing theoretical estimations with numerical simulations
showed that the proposed models estimate the scale dependence of permeability
and formation factor reasonably. The calculated relative error (RE) ranged
between -3.7 and 3.8% for the permeability and between 0.21 and 4.04% for the
formation factor in the studied pore-networks.

to their large compactnesses and strong gravitational fields. For example,
binary pulsar and gravitational wave observations have placed stringent bounds
on certain scalar-tensor theories in which a massless scalar field is coupled
to the metric through matter. A remarkable phenomenon of neutron stars in such
scalar-tensor theories is spontaneous scalarization, where a normalized scalar
charge remains order unity even if the matter-scalar coupling vanishes
asymptotically far from the neutron star. While most works on scalarization of
neutron stars focus on numerical analysis, this paper aims to derive accurate
scalar charges analytically. To achieve this, we consider a simple energy
density profile of the Tolman VII form and work in a weak-field expansion. We
solve the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations order by order and
apply Pad\'e resummation to account for higher-order effects. We find that our
analytic scalar charges in terms of the stellar compactness beautifully model
those computed numerically. We also find a quasi-universal relation between the
scalar charge and stellar binding energy that is insensitive to the underlying
equations of state. Comparison of analytic scalar charges for Tolman VII and
constant density stars mathematically support this quasi-universal relation.
The analytic results found here provide physically motivated, ready-to-use
accurate expressions for scalar charges.

on a case study in which we use the open data of the Dutch criminal justice
system that rechtspraak.nl/Uitspraken makes available. Over the period
2015-2020, we analysed sentencing in 25,366 court judgments and, in particular,
investigated the relationship between sentence severity and the offender's use
of advanced ICT -- as this is information that is readily available in open

  The most important results are, firstly, that offenders who use advanced ICT
are sentenced to longer custodial sentences compared to other offenders.
Second, our results show that the quality of sentencing research with open data

neural methods that capture local and global distributional properties. They
are leveraged in downstream tasks using various neural architectures that are
designed to optimize task-specific objectives that might further tune such
embeddings. Since 2018, however, there is a marked shift from these static
embeddings to contextual embeddings motivated by language models (e.g., ELMo,
transformers such as BERT, and ULMFiT). These dynamic embeddings have the added
benefit of being able to distinguish homonyms and acronyms given their context.
However, static embeddings are still relevant in low resource settings (e.g.,
smart devices, IoT elements) and to study lexical semantics from a
computational linguistics perspective. In this paper, we jointly learn word and
concept embeddings by first using the skip-gram method and further fine-tuning
them with correlational information manifesting in co-occurring Medical Subject
Heading (MeSH) concepts in biomedical citations. This fine-tuning is
accomplished with the BERT transformer architecture in the two-sentence input
mode with a classification objective that captures MeSH pair co-occurrence. In
essence, we repurpose a transformer architecture (typically used to generate
dynamic embeddings) to improve static embeddings using concept correlations. We
conduct evaluations of these tuned static embeddings using multiple datasets
for word relatedness developed by previous efforts. Without selectively culling
concepts and terms (as was pursued by previous efforts), we believe we offer
the most exhaustive evaluation of static embeddings to date with clear
performance improvements across the board. We provide our code and embeddings

young massive stars using analytic theory. We do this in order to determine why
there is a discrepancy between theoretical models that predict that winds
should play a secondary role to photoionisation in the dynamics of HII regions,
and observations of young HII regions that seem to suggest a driving role for
winds. In particular, regions such as M42 in Orion have neutral hydrogen
shells, suggesting that the ionising radiation is trapped closer to the star.
We first derive formulae for wind bubble evolution in non-uniform density
fields, focusing on singular isothermal sphere density fields with a power law
index of -2. We find that a classical ""Weaver""-like expansion velocity becomes
constant in such a density distribution. We then calculate the structure of the
photoionised shell around such wind bubbles, and determine at what point the
mass in the shell cannot absorb all of the ionising photons emitted by the
star, causing an ""overflow"" of ionising radiation. We also estimate
perturbations from cooling, gravity, magnetic fields and instabilities, all of
which we argue are secondary effects for the conditions studied here. Our
wind-driven model provides a consistent explanation for the behaviour of M42 to
within the errors given by observational studies. We find that in relatively
denser molecular cloud environments \around single young stellar sources,
champagne flows are unlikely until the wind shell breaks up due to turbulence
or clumping in the cloud.

development of conversational dialogue systems (chatbots). Evaluations
requiring humans to converse with chatbots are time and cost-intensive, put
high cognitive demands on the human judges, and yield low-quality results. In
this work, we introduce \emph{Spot The Bot}, a cost-efficient and robust
evaluation framework that replaces human-bot conversations with conversations
between bots. Human judges then only annotate for each entity in a conversation
whether they think it is human or not (assuming there are humans participants
in these conversations). These annotations then allow us to rank chatbots
regarding their ability to mimic the conversational behavior of humans. Since
we expect that all bots are eventually recognized as such, we incorporate a
metric that measures which chatbot can uphold human-like behavior the longest,
i.e., \emph{Survival Analysis}. This metric has the ability to correlate a
bot's performance to certain of its characteristics (e.g., \ fluency or

attention has focused on mitigating COVID-19 burden among adults. However, a
tragic consequence of adult deaths is that high numbers of children might lose
their parents and caregivers to COVID-19-associated deaths.
  Methods: We quantified COVID-19-associated caregiver loss and orphanhood in
the US and for each state using fertility and excess and COVID-19 mortality
data. We assessed burden and rates of COVID-19-associated orphanhood and deaths
of custodial and co-residing grandparents, overall and by race/ethnicity. We
further examined variations in COVID-19-associated orphanhood by race/ethnicity
for each state.
  Results: We found that from April 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021, over 140,000
children in the US experienced the death of a parent or grandparent caregiver.
The risk of such loss was 1.1 to 4.5 times higher among children of racial and
ethnic minorities, compared to Non-Hispanic White children. The highest burden
of COVID-19-associated death of parents and caregivers occurred in Southern
border states for Hispanic children, Southeastern states for Black children,
and in states with tribal areas for American Indian/Alaska Native populations.
  Conclusions: We found substantial disparities in distributions of
COVID-19-associated death of parents and caregivers across racial and ethnic
groups. Children losing caregivers to COVID-19 need care and safe, stable, and
nurturing families with economic support, quality childcare and evidence-based
parenting support programs. There is an urgent need to mount an evidence-based

to efficient inference. Nevertheless, graphical approaches to causal inference
have not been embraced by the statistics and public health communities. In
those communities causal assumptions are instead expressed in terms of
potential outcomes, or responses to hypothetical interventions. Such
interventions are generally conceptualized only on a limited set of variables,
where the corresponding experiment could, in principle, be performed. By
contrast, graphical approaches to causal inference generally assume
interventions on all variables are well defined - an overly restrictive and
unrealistic assumption that may have limited the adoption of these approaches
in applied work in statistics and public health. In this paper, we build on a
unification of graphical and potential outcomes approaches to causality
exemplified by Single World Intervention Graphs (SWIGs) to define graphical
models with a restricted set of allowed interventions. We give a complete
identification theory for such models, and develop a complete calculus of
interventions based on a generalization of the do-calculus, and axioms that
govern probabilistic operations on Markov kernels. A corollary of our results
is a complete identification theory for causal effects in another graphical
framework with a restricted set of interventions, the decision theoretic
graphical formulation of causality.

navigation, especially in unknown environments, through directly mapping
perception inputs into robot control commands. Most existing methods adopt
uniform execution duration with robots taking commands at fixed intervals. As
such, the length of execution duration becomes a crucial parameter to the
navigation algorithm. In particular, if the duration is too short, then the
navigation policy would be executed at a high frequency, with increased
training difficulty and high computational cost. Meanwhile, if the duration is
too long, then the policy becomes unable to handle complex situations, like
those with crowded obstacles. It is thus tricky to find the ""sweet"" duration
range; some duration values may render a DRL model to fail to find a navigation
path. In this paper, we propose to employ adaptive execution duration to
overcome this problem. Specifically, we formulate the navigation task as a
Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) problem to handle adaptive execution
duration. We also improve the distributed proximal policy optimization (DPPO)
algorithm and provide its theoretical guarantee for the specified SMDP problem.
We evaluate our approach both in the simulator and on an actual robot. The
results show that our approach outperforms the other DRL-based method (with
fixed execution duration) by 10.3% in terms of the navigation success rate.

(MW) and Andromeda (M31) are depleted relative to more isolated galaxies in the
Local Group (LG) at fixed stellar mass. We explore the environmental regulation
of gas content and quenching of star formation in $z=0$ galaxies at
$M_{*}=10^{5-10}$ $\rm{M}_{\odot}$ around 14 MW-mass hosts from the FIRE-2
simulations. Lower-mass satellites ($M_{*}\lesssim10^7$ $\rm{M}_{\odot}$) are
mostly quiescent and higher-mass satellites ($M_{*}\gtrsim10^8$
$\rm{M}_{\odot}$) are mostly star-forming, with intermediate-mass satellites
($M_{*}\approx10^{7-8}$ $\rm{M}_{\odot}$) split roughly equally between
quiescent and star-forming. Hosts with more gas in their circumgalactic medium
have a higher quiescent fraction of massive satellites ($M_{*}=10^{8-9}$
$\rm{M}_{\odot}$). We find no significant dependence on isolated versus paired
(LG-like) host environments, and the quiescent fractions of satellites around
MW-mass and LMC-mass hosts from the FIRE-2 simulations are remarkably similar.
Environmental effects that lead to quenching can also occur as preprocessing in
low-mass groups prior to MW infall. Lower-mass satellites typically quenched
before MW infall as central galaxies or rapidly during infall into a low-mass
group or a MW-mass galaxy. Intermediate- to high-mass satellites usually
require $\geq1-2$ pericentre passages ($\approx2.5-5$ Gyr) within a MW-mass
halo to quench. Most galaxies with $M_{*}\gtrsim10^{6.5}$ $\rm{M}_{\odot}$ did
not quench before falling into a host, indicating a possible upper mass limit
for isolated quenching. The simulations are broadly consistent with the
quiescent fractions of satellites observed in the LG and the SAGA survey,
because the simulation average lies between them and the host-to-host scatter
is large.

communications in recent days is attributed to their ability to schedule
multiple access more efficiently as compared to its predecessor technology,

issues still remaining is the need for the V2X to operate stably in a highly
dynamic environment. This paper proposes a way to exploit the dynamicity. That
is, we propose a resource allocation mechanism adaptive to the environment,
which can be an efficient solution for air interface congestion that a V2X
network often suffers from. Specifically, the proposed mechanism aims at
granting a higher chance of transmission to a vehicle with a higher crash risk.
As such, the channel access is prioritized to those with urgent needs. The
proposed framework is established based on reinforcement learning (RL), which
is modeled as a contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB). Importantly, the framework
is designed to operate at a vehicle autonomously without any assistance from a
central entity, which, henceforth, is expected to make a particular fit to
distributed V2X network such as C-V2X mode 4.

speed up the attack process, we propose a reinforcement learning based frame
selection strategy. Specifically, the agent explores the difference between the
original class and the target class of videos to make selection decisions. It
receives rewards from threat models which indicate the quality of the
decisions. Besides, we also use saliency detection to select key regions and
only estimate the sign of gradient instead of the gradient itself in zeroth
order optimization to further boost the attack process. We can use the trained
model directly in the untargeted attack or with little fine-tune in the
targeted attack, which saves computation time. A range of empirical results on

gravitino pairs which result in violation of BBN constraints or overproduction
of lightest SUSY particles (LSPs, assumed to constitute at least a portion of
the dark matter in the universe) and 3. they may decay directly into LSPs,
resulting in gross DM overproduction. Together, these constitute the
cosmological moduli problem (CMP). The combined effects require lightest

of the encoder and the data over a noisy communication channel. We show that
learning for a noise-robust activation code increases the number of distinct
linear regions of ReLU encoders, hence the maximum nonlinear expressivity. More
interestingly, NAC learns both continuous and discrete representations of data,
which we respectively evaluate on two downstream tasks: (i) linear
classification on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K and (ii) nearest neighbor retrieval

second-generation dust. While it remains unclear whether this ever becomes a
major component of the total dust content, the presence of such dust, and
potentially the substructure within, it can be used to explore a disc's
physical conditions. A perturbing planet produces nonaxisymmetric structures
and gaps in the dust, regardless of its origin. The dynamics of planetesimals,
however, will be very different than that of small dust grains due to weaker
gas interactions. Therefore, planetesimal collisions could create dusty disc
structures that would not exist otherwise. In this work, we use N-body
simulations to investigate the collision rate profile of planetesimals near
mean-motion resonances. We find that a distinct bump or dip feature is produced
in the collision profile, the presence of which depends on the libration width
of the resonance and the separation between the peri- and apocenter distances
of the edges of the resonance. The presence of one of these two features
depends on the mass and eccentricity of the planet. Assuming that the radial
dust emission traces the planetesimal collision profile, the presence of a bump
or dip feature in the dust emission at the 2:1 mean-motion resonance can
constrain the orbital properties of the perturbing planet. This assumption is
valid, so long as radial drift does not play a significant role during the
collisional cascade process. Under this assumption, these features in the dust
emission should be marginally observable in nearby protoplanetary disks with
ALMA.

theory. From the viewpoint of measuring approximation error in the maximum
norm, it is evident that best approximations are better than their Chebyshev
counterparts. However, the situation may be reversed if we compare the
approximation quality from the viewpoint of either the rate of pointwise
convergence or the accuracy of spectral differentiation. We show that when the
underlying function has an algebraic singularity, the Chebyshev projection of
degree n converges one power of n faster than its best counterpart at each
point away from the singularity and both converge at the same rate at the
singularity. This gives a complete explanation for the phenomenon that the
accuracy of Chebyshev projections is much better than that of best
approximations except in a small neighborhood of the singularity. Extensions to
superconvergence points and spectral differentiation, Chebyshev interpolants

its support of knowledge transfer among languages and the low cost of training
and deployment compared with numerous bilingual models. A known challenge of
multilingual models is the negative language interference. In order to enhance
the translation quality, deeper and wider architectures are applied to
multilingual modeling for larger model capacity, which suffers from the
increased inference cost at the same time. It has been pointed out in recent
studies that parameters shared among languages are the cause of interference
while they may also enable positive transfer. Based on these insights, we
propose an adaptive and sparse architecture for multilingual modeling, and
train the model to learn shared and language-specific parameters to improve the
positive transfer and mitigate the interference. The sparse architecture only
activates a sub-network which preserves inference efficiency, and the adaptive
design selects different sub-networks based on the input languages. Our model
outperforms strong baselines across multiple benchmarks. On the large-scale
OPUS dataset with $100$ languages, we achieve $+2.1$, $+1.3$ and $+6.2$ BLEU
improvements in one-to-many, many-to-one and zero-shot tasks respectively

two-stage partially recurrent neural network to improve anomaly classification
rate in power distribution networks using high-fidelity data from micro-phasor

constraint satisfaction problems. We transform the PMUs data from the power
network into a constraint satisfaction problem and use QGS to train a neural
network by solving the resulting optimization problem. Simulation results show
that the proposed supervised classification method can reliably distinguish
between different anomalies in power distribution networks. Comparison with
other neural network classifiers shows that QGS trained networks provide
significantly better classification. Sensitivity analysis is performed

  equations and analysis of their forecasting capabilities",27 pages,,,,physics.soc-ph,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Mathematical modeling of disease spreading plays a crucial role in
understanding, controlling and preventing epidemic outbreaks. In a microscopic
description of the propagation of a disease over the complex network of human
contacts, the probability that an individual is in a given state (susceptible,
infectious, recovered etc) depends on the state of its neighbors in the
network. Thus it depends on the state of pairs of nodes, which in turns depends
on triples, in a hierarchy of dynamical dependencies. In order to produce
models that are at the same time reliable and manageable, one has to understand
how to truncate such a hierarchy, and how the chosen order of approximation
affects the ability of the model to forecast the real temporal evolution of an
epidemics. In this paper we provide a systematic analysis of the reliability
(under different hypotheses on the quantity and quality of available data) of
the predictions obtained by truncating the hierarchy either at the level of
individuals or at the level of pairs. We find that pair-based models are
reliable tools both for estimating the epidemiological parameters and for
forecasting the temporal evolution of the epidemics, under all conditions taken
into account in our work. However, a pair-based approach provides a much better
prediction of an individual-based one, only if better data, namely information
on the state of node pairs, are available. Overall, our results suggest that
more refined mathematical models need to be informed by improved contact
tracing techniques to better support decision on policies and containment
measures to adopt.

characteristics into a super sensor that has superior noise performance. To
achieve sensor fusion, complementary filters are used in current
gravitational-wave detectors to combine relative displacement sensors and
inertial sensors for active seismic isolation. Complementary filters are a set
of digital filters, which have transfer functions that are summed to unity.
Currently, complementary filters are shaped and tuned manually rather than
optimized, which can be suboptimal and hard to reproduce for future detectors.
In this paper, an optimization-based method called $\mathcal{H}_\infty$
synthesis is proposed for synthesizing optimal complementary filters according
to the sensor noises themselves. The complementary filter design problem is
converted into an optimization problem that seeks minimization of an objective
function equivalent to the maximum difference between the super sensor noise
and the lower bound in logarithmic scale. The method is exemplified by
synthesizing complementary filters for sensor fusion of 1) a relative
displacement sensor and an inertial sensor, 2) a relative displacement sensor
coupled with seismic noise and an inertial sensor, and 3) hypothetical
displacement sensor and inertial sensor, which have slightly different noise
characteristics compared to the typical ones. In all cases, the method produces
complementary filters that suppress the super sensor noise equally close to the
lower bound at all frequencies in logarithmic scale. The synthesized filters
contain features that better suppress the sensor noises compared to the
pre-designed complementary filters. Overall, the proposed method allows the
synthesis of optimal complementary filters according to the sensor noises
themselves and is a better and versatile method for solving sensor fusion
problems.

spaces, such as those composed of images, have interconnected learning burdens.
Agents must learn an action-selection policy that completes their given task,
which requires them to learn a representation of the state space that discerns
between useful and useless information. The reward function is the only
supervised feedback that RL agents receive, which causes a representation
learning bottleneck that can manifest in poor sample efficiency. We present

temporal consistency of representations via a self-supervised auxiliary task

Altogether, KSL produces state-of-the-art results in both data efficiency and
asymptotic performance in the popular PlaNet benchmark suite. Our analyses show
that KSL produces encoders that generalize better to new tasks unseen during
training, and its representations are more strongly tied to reward, are more
invariant to perturbations in the state space, and move more smoothly through

challenges of image classifications in practice, such as classifying noisy
image or image-set queries and training deep image classification models over
the limited-scale dataset. Instead of applying generic deep features, the
model-based approaches can be more effective and data-efficient for robust
image and image-set classification tasks, as various image priors are exploited
for modeling the inter- and intra-set data variations while preventing
over-fitting. In this work, we propose a novel Joint Statistical and Spatial
Sparse representation, dubbed \textit{J3S}, to model the image or image-set
data for classification, by reconciling both their local patch structures and

structures jointly via joint sparse representation. We propose to solve the

($\sigma$) in the model and (ii) hybrid expansion law $a = t^\beta e^{\gamma
t}$, where $\beta>0$, $\gamma>0$. Our study is based on Type Ia supernovae
(SNIa) data in combination with CMB and BAO observations (Giostri et al, JCAP

constant and deceleration parameter are $H_{0} = 73.8$ and $q_{0} = -0.54$
respectively. Compiling our theoretical models with this data, we obtain $\beta
= 2.1445~ \& ~ 2.1154$ for $\gamma = 0.5 ~ \& ~ 1$ respectively. We have
completed a new type of cosmic model for which the expansion occurs to the
current accelerated phase for the restraints. We have discussed the conformity
among the scalar field model of quintessence and THDE model. To understand the

Luminosity Distance, and Angular-diameter distance. Some geometric and physical

based on a very large number of features, this paper introduces a new class of
cluster-based graphical models, in which variable clustering is applied as an
initial step for reducing the dimension of the feature space. We employ model
assisted clustering, in which the clusters contain features that are similar to
the same unobserved latent variable. Two different cluster-based Gaussian
graphical models are considered: the latent variable graph, corresponding to
the graphical model associated with the unobserved latent variables, and the
cluster-average graph, corresponding to the vector of features averaged over
clusters. Our study reveals that likelihood based inference for the latent
graph, not analyzed previously, is analytically intractable. Our main
contribution is the development and analysis of alternative estimation and
inference strategies, for the precision matrix of an unobservable latent vector
$Z$. We replace the likelihood of the data by an appropriate class of empirical
risk functions, that can be specialized to the latent graphical model and to
the simpler, but under-analyzed, cluster-average graphical model. The
estimators thus derived can be used for inference on the graph structure, for
instance on edge strength or pattern recovery. Inference is based on the
asymptotic limits of the entry-wise estimates of the precision matrices
associated with the conditional independence graphs under consideration. While
taking the uncertainty induced by the clustering step into account, we
establish Berry-Esseen central limit theorems for the proposed estimators. It
is noteworthy that, although the clusters are estimated adaptively from the
data, the central limit theorems regarding the entries of the estimated graphs
are proved under the same conditions one would use if the clusters were
known....

nonrotating black holes, such as a Schwarzschild black hole. However, they fail
to work in the Kerr spacetime because not all variables can be separable, or
not all splitting parts have analytical solutions as explicit functions of
proper time. To cope with this difficulty, we introduce a time transformation
function to the Hamiltonian of Kerr geometry so as to obtain a time-transformed
Hamiltonian consisting of five splitting parts, whose analytical solutions are
explicit functions of the new coordinate time. The chosen time transformation
function can cause time steps to be adaptive, but it is mainly used to
implement the desired splitting of the time transformed Hamiltonian. In this
manner, new explicit symplectic algorithms are easily available. Unlike Runge
Kutta integrators, the newly proposed algorithms exhibit good long term
behavior in the conservation of Hamiltonian quantities when appropriate fixed
coordinate time steps are considered. They are better than same order implicit
and explicit mixed symplectic algorithms and extended phase space explicit
symplectic like methods in computational efficiency. The proposed idea on the
construction of explicit symplectic integrators is suitable for not only the
Kerr metric but also many other relativistic problems, such as a Kerr black
hole immersed in a magnetic field, a Kerr Newman black hole with an external
magnetic field, axially symmetric core shell systems, and five dimensional

To overcome this issue, we propose an optimization-based procedure which does

all available related data (2D bounding boxes, 2D hand keypoints, 2D instance
masks, 3D object models, 3D in-the-lab MoCap) to provide constraints for the 3D
reconstruction. Rather than optimizing the hand and object individually, we
optimize them jointly which allows us to impose additional constraints based on
hand-object contact, collision, and occlusion. Our method produces compelling
reconstructions on the challenging in-the-wild data from the EPIC Kitchens and
the 100 Days of Hands datasets, across a range of object categories.
Quantitatively, we demonstrate that our approach compares favorably to existing
approaches in the lab settings where ground truth 3D annotations are available.

experiments. Furthermore, by an analogy with dual-symmetric electromagnetic

put forward an acoustic ${\it spinor}$ representation combining the scalar and

graphs} (which are a proper subclass of chordal graphs and a proper superclass
of interval graphs) with $n$ vertices while supporting degree, adjacency, and

Our first data structure is succinct and occupies $n \log n+o(n \log n)$ bits
while answering adjacency query in $O(\log n)$ time, and neighborhood and
degree queries in $O(d \log^2 n)$ time where $d$ is the degree of the queried

expense of slightly more space. More specifically, we provide an $O(n \log^2

neighborhood query in $O(d)$ time where $d$ is the degree of the queried
vertex. Central to our data structures is the usage of the classical heavy path
decomposition, followed by a careful bookkeeping using an orthogonal range
search data structure among others, which maybe of independent interest for
designing succinct data structures for other graphs. It is the use of the
results of Acan et al. \cite{HSSS} in the second data structure that permits a

arbitrary frequency structure to the high precision required for 21 cm

baseline).
  We have achieved this through two key innovations. Firstly, we model the
foregrounds on each baseline independently using a flexible and highly
efficient set of basis functions that have minimal overlap with 21 cm modes and
enforce spectral smoothness in the calibrated foregrounds. Secondly, we use an
off-the-shelf GPU accelerated API (TENSORFLOW) to solve for per-baseline
foregrounds simultaneously with per-frequency antenna gains in a single
optimization loop. GPU acceleration is critical for our technique to be able to
solve for the large numbers of foreground and gain parameters simultaneously
across all frequencies for an interferometer with $\gtrsim 10$ antennas in a
reasonable amount of time. In this paper, we give an overview of our technique
and using realistic simulations and demonstrate its performance in solving for

fluctuations in the 21 cm emission field from Hydrogen gas during the Cosmic

if the observation of the past of $X$ increases the predictability of the
future of $Y$ when compared to the same prediction done with the past of $Y$

that information extracted from the past of one of them improves the forecast

  turbulent flow",,,10.1017/jfm.2022.125,,physics.flu-dyn,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We experimentally investigate the drag modification by neutrally buoyant
finite-size particles with various aspect ratios in a Taylor-Couette (TC)
turbulent flow. The current Reynolds number, $Re$, ranges from $6.5\times10^3$
to $2.6\times10^4$, and the particle volume fraction, $\Phi$, is up to $10\%$.
Particles with three kinds of aspect ratio, $\lambda$, are used: $\lambda=1/3$
(oblate), $\lambda=1$ (spherical) and $\lambda=3$ (prolate). Unlike the case of
bubbly TC flow, we find that the suspended finite-size particles increase the
drag of the TC system regardless of their aspect ratios. In addition, the
normalized friction coefficient, $c_{f,\Phi}/c_{f,\Phi=0}$, decreases with
increasing $Re$, the reason could be that in the current low volume fractions
the turbulent stress becomes dominant at higher $Re$. As $Re$ increases, the
particles distribute more evenly in the entire system, which results from both
the greater turbulence intensity and the more pronounced finite-size effects of
the particles at higher $Re$. Moreover, it is found that the variation of the
particle aspect ratios leads to different particle collective effects. The
suspended spherical particles, which tend to cluster near the walls and form a
particle layer, significantly affect the boundary layer and result in maximum
drag modification. The minimal drag modification is found in the oblate case,
where the particles preferentially cluster in the bulk region, and thus the
particle layer is absent. Based on the optical measurement results, it can be
concluded that, in the low volume fraction ranges ($\Phi=0.5\%$ and $\Phi =
2\%$ here), the larger drag modification is connected to the near-wall particle
clustering. The present findings suggest that the particle shape plays a
significant role in drag modification.

our CF-ViT implements network inference in a two-stage manner. At coarse

a computationally economical classification. If not well recognized, the
informative patches are identified and further re-split in a fine-grained
granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our CF-ViT. For

First, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based resource allocation

the algorithm uses deep Q-network (DQN) to solve the sub-band assignment and
deep deterministic policy-gradient (DDPG) to solve the continuous power

for interpreting solar activities and dynamo. In this research, we investigated
the asymmetric distribution of the solar photospheric magnetic field values,
using synoptic charts constructed from space-borne high-resolution
magnetograms. It is demonstrated that the Lorentzian function describes the
distribution of magnetic field values in the synoptic charts much better than
the Gaussian function, and this should reflect the gradual decay process from
strong to weak magnetic fields. The asymmetry values are calculated under
several circumstances, and the results generally show two periodicities related
to the variation of the solar B$_0$ angle and the solar cycle, respectively. We
argue that it is the small-scale magnetic fields, the inclination of the solar
axis, the emergence and evolution of magnetic flux, and the polar fields that
are responsible for the features of asymmetry values. We further determined the
polar field reversal time of solar cycles 23 and 24 with the flip of asymmetry
values. Specifically, for cycle 24, we assert that the polar polarities of both
hemispheres reversed at the same time - in March 2014; as to cycle 23, the
reversal time of the S-hemisphere is March 2001, while the determination of the

First, we show that forward computation in DNNs with logistic sigmoid

DNN as a probabilistic model of the output and all hidden units given the

  Distance and Longest Common Subsequence","This paper is accepted to Foundations of Software Technology and

(LCS) in the asymmetric streaming model, introduced by Saks and Seshadhri
[SS13]. As an intermediate model between the random access model and the
streaming model, this model allows one to have streaming access to one string
and random access to the other string.
  Our first main contribution is a systematic study of space lower bounds for
ED and LCS in the asymmetric streaming model. Previously, there are no
explicitly stated results in this context, although some lower bounds about LCS
can be inferred from the lower bounds for longest increasing subsequence (LIS)
in [SW07][GG10][EJ08]. Yet these bounds only work for large alphabet size. In
this paper, we develop several new techniques to handle ED in general and LCS
for small alphabet size, thus establishing strong lower bounds for both
problems. In particular, our lower bound for ED provides an exponential
separation between edit distance and Hamming distance in the asymmetric
streaming model. Our lower bounds also extend to LIS and longest non-decreasing
sequence (LNS) in the standard streaming model. Together with previous results,
our bounds provide an almost complete picture for these two problems.
  As our second main contribution, we give improved algorithms for ED and LCS
in the asymmetric streaming model. For ED, we improve the space complexity of
the constant factor approximation algorithms in [FHRS20][CJLZ20] from
$\tilde{O}(\frac{n^\delta}{\delta})$ to
$O(\frac{d^\delta}{\delta}\;\mathsf{polylog}(n))$, where $n$ is the length of
each string and $d$ is the edit distance between the two strings. For LCS, we
give the first $1/2+\epsilon$ approximation algorithm with space $n^{\delta}$
for any constant $\delta>0$, over a binary alphabet.

balanced gradient moments as, e.g., used for quantitative MRI.
  Theory and Methods: Eddy current artifacts in balanced sequences result from
large jumps in k-space. In quantitative MRI, one often samples some spin
dynamics repeatedly while acquiring different parts of k-space. We swap
individual k-space lines between different repetitions in order to minimize
jumps within each repetition. This reordering can be formulated as a travelling
salesman problem and we tackle the discrete optimization with a simulated
annealing algorithm.
  Results: The proposed approach is highly effective at minimizing the change
of the readout direction of a 3D koosh-ball trajectory. This decreases the
eddy-current induced perturbations of the magnetization and reduces artifacts
in the derived parameter maps, as demonstrated in the example of a hybrid-state
free precession sequence.
  Conclusion: Beyond this example application, we believe that the approach can
be used for most k-space trajectories, other quantitative MRI methods, as well
as for cine cardiac imaging.

MHD simulations. A model of a gravitationally stratified expanding straight
coronal loop, stretching from photosphere to photosphere, is perturbed at one
footpoint by an acoustic driver with a period of 370 seconds. For this period
acoustic cutoff regions are present below the transition region (TR). About 2%
of the initial energy from the driver reach the corona. The shape of the cutoff
regions and the height of the TR show a highly dynamic behavior. Taking only
the driven waves into account, the waves have a propagating nature below and
above the cutoff region, but are standing and evanescent within the cutoff

standing waves cause an oscillation of the TR height. In addition, fast or
leaky sausage body-like waves might have been excited close to the base of the
loop. These waves then possibly convert to fast or leaky sausage surface-like
waves at the top of the main cutoff region, followed by a conversion to slow
sausage body-like waves around the TR.

non-meaningful bound in the average-reward setting. By addressing the
average-reward criterion directly, we then derive a novel bound which depends
on the average divergence between the two policies and Kemeny's constant. Based
on this bound, we develop an iterative procedure which produces a sequence of
monotonically improved policies for the average reward criterion. This
iterative procedure can then be combined with classic DRL (Deep Reinforcement
Learning) methods, resulting in practical DRL algorithms that target the
long-run average reward criterion. In particular, we demonstrate that
Average-Reward TRPO (ATRPO), which adapts the on-policy TRPO algorithm to the
average-reward criterion, significantly outperforms TRPO in the most
challenging MuJuCo environments.

contrastive learning on semantic-matched and class-unique variables to learn
high intra-set and intra-class similarity, as well as inter-set and inter-class

empirical observations by asymptotically analyzing linear least squares and
random forest regressions under a linear model. Our main results demonstrate
that the benefit of ensembling compared to training a single model on the
entire data, often termed 'merging', might depend on the underlying bias and
variance interplay of the individual predictors to be aggregated. In
particular, under both fixed and high dimensional linear models, we show that
merging is asymptotically superior to optimal ensembling techniques for linear
least squares regression due to the unbiased nature of least squares
prediction. In contrast, for random forest regression under fixed dimensional
linear models, our bounds imply a strict benefit of ensembling over merging.
Finally, we also present numerical experiments to verify the validity of our
asymptotic results across different situations.

quadratic (de Sitter) terms. Correspondingly, rotation curves are predicted to
be Keplerian in the inner regions of galaxies, mostly flat in the outer

$r_b\sim 2$. To determine the role of the X-galaxy in the lens system, we
modelled the dual-lens system with constraints from the VLBI-resolved jet
components and the HST images. The 8.4-GHz global-VLBI data currently provide
the most stringent constraints to the mass model, especially to the radial
power-law slope. The optimized models for this two-image three-component radio
lens favour a steeper-than-isothermal inner slope. The jet bending in image B
was also investigated and it turned out to be rather a misalignment than a
curvature. The goodness of fit indicates that the role of the X-galaxy is
crucial in the lens system if three pairs of resolved jet components are to be
fitted. When we imported the optimal model from radio constraints to optical
modelling with the HST tri-band data, the optimization kept the consistency of
the optimal model and successfully reproduced the features observed in the HST

actually a detection of the secondary lensing effects from the companion lens.

attack scenarios. Therefore, two feature sets (NetFlow and CICFlowMeter) have
been evaluated in terms of detection accuracy across three key datasets, i.e.,

93 in-situ stars from the Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) DR3, of

clearly show higher ratios of [{Eu}/{Mg}] than in-situ stars. High [{Eu}/{Mg}]
along with low [{Mg}/{Fe}] are also seen in relatively massive satellite
galaxies such as the LMC, Fornax, and Sagittarius dwarfs. On the other hand,
unlike these galaxies, Gaia-Enceladus does not show enhanced [{Ba}/{Eu}] or
[{La}/{Eu}] ratios suggesting a lack of significant $s$-process contribution.
From comparisons with simple chemical evolution models, we show that the high

(OASP), a variant of the orienteering problem for a robot moving in a so-called
single-access aisle-graph, i.e., a graph consisting of a set of rows that can
be accessed from one side only. Aisle-graphs model, among others, vineyards or
warehouses. Each aisle-graph vertex is associated with a reward that a robot
obtains when visits the vertex itself. As the robot's energy is limited, only a
subset of vertices can be visited with a fully charged battery. The objective
is to maximize the total reward collected by the robot with a battery charge.
We first propose an optimal algorithm that solves OASP in O(m^2 n^2) time for
aisle-graphs with a single access consisting of m rows, each with n vertices.
With the goal of designing faster solutions, we propose four greedy sub-optimal
algorithms that run in at most O(mn (m+n)) time. For two of them, we guarantee
an approximation ratio of 1/2(1-1/e), where e is the base of the natural
logarithm, on the total reward by exploiting the well-known submodularity
property. Experimentally, we show that these algorithms collect more than 80%
of the optimal reward.

space by incremental learning of the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network.
Gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer are few widely used sensors in
attitude estimation applications. Traditionally, multi-sensor fusion methods
such as the Extended Kalman Filter and Complementary Filter are employed to
fuse the measurements from these sensors. However, these methods exhibit
limitations in accounting for the uncertainty, unpredictability, and dynamic
nature of the motion in real-world situations. In this paper, the inertial
sensors data are fed to the LSTM network which are then updated incrementally
to incorporate the dynamic changes in motion occurring in the run time. The
robustness and efficiency of the proposed framework is demonstrated on the
dataset collected from a commercially available inertial measurement unit. The
proposed framework offers a significant improvement in the results compared to
the traditional method, even in the case of a highly dynamic environment. The
LSTM framework-based attitude estimation approach can be deployed on a standard
AI-supported processing module for real-time applications.

attention recently, either from heating due to DM annihilation or its stability
under the presence of DM. In this work, we investigate spin-$1/2$ fermionic DM
$\chi$ charged under the $U(1)_{X}$ in the dark sector. The massive gauge boson
$V$ of $U(1)_{X}$ gauge group can be produced in NS via DM annihilation. The
produced gauge boson can decay into Standard Model (SM) particles before it
exits the NS, despite its tiny couplings to SM particles. Thus, we perform a
systematic study on $\chi\bar{\chi}\to2V\to4{\rm SM}$ as a new heating
mechanism for NS in addition to $\chi\bar{\chi}\to2{\rm SM}$ and kinetic
heating from DM-baryon scattering. The self-trapping due to $\chi V$ scattering
is also considered. We assume the general framework that both kinetic and mass
mixing terms between $V$ and SM gauge bosons are present. This allows both
vector and axial-vector couplings between $V$ and SM fermions even for $m_V\ll
m_Z$. Notably, the contribution from axial-vector coupling is not negligible
when particles scatter relativistically. We point out that the above approaches
to DM-induced NS heating are not yet adopted in recent analyses.
Detectabilities of the aforementioned effects to the NS surface temperature by
the future telescopes are discussed as well.

the interface. Following the derivation of the solution we demonstrate that
there is a well-defined relationship between the imposed pressure at the

imposing the continuity of the pressure along the interface generates an

have inherently fine-grained attributes (e.g., bird-species recognition,
medical image classification). In addition to achieving reliable accuracy, a
critical subtask for these models is to detect Out-of-distribution (OOD)
inputs. Given the nature of the deployment environment, one may expect such OOD
inputs to also be fine-grained w.r.t. the known classes (e.g., a novel bird
species), which are thus extremely difficult to identify. Unfortunately, OOD
detection in fine-grained scenarios remains largely underexplored. In this
work, we aim to fill this gap by first carefully constructing four large-scale
fine-grained test environments, in which existing methods are shown to have
difficulties. Particularly, we find that even explicitly incorporating a
diverse set of auxiliary outlier data during training does not provide
sufficient coverage over the broad region where fine-grained OOD samples
locate. We then propose Mixture Outlier Exposure (MixOE), which mixes ID data
and training outliers to expand the coverage of different OOD granularities,
and trains the model such that the prediction confidence linearly decays as the
input transitions from ID to OOD. Extensive experiments and analyses
demonstrate the effectiveness of MixOE for building up OOD detector in
fine-grained environments. Code is available at

In our model, the regularization parameter is a matrix whose entries can

dramatically affected by the parameterisation used to express a model,
requiring users to transform their programs in non-intuitive ways. We argue for
automating these transformations, and demonstrate that mechanisms available in
recent modeling frameworks can implement non-centring and related
reparameterisations. This enables new inference algorithms, and we propose two:
a simple approach using interleaved sampling and a novel variational
formulation that searches over a continuous space of parameterisations. We show
that these approaches enable robust inference across a range of models, and can
yield more efficient samplers than the best fixed parameterisation.

consider how to train an artificial neural network potential to describe
inhomogeneous, disordered systems. We find that neural network potentials based
on local representations of atomic environments are capable of describing some
properties of liquid-vapor interfaces, but typically fail for properties that
depend on unbalanced long-ranged interactions which build up in the presence of
broken translation symmetry. These same interactions cancel in the
translationally invariant bulk, allowing local neural network potentials to
describe bulk properties correctly. By incorporating explicit models of the
slowly-varying long-ranged interactions and training neural networks only on
the short ranged components, we can arrive at potentials that robustly recover
interfacial properties. We find that local neural network models can sometimes
approximate a local molecular field potential to correct for the truncated
interactions, but this behavior is variable and hard to learn. Generally, we
find that models with explicit electrostatics are easier to train and have
higher accuracy. We demonstrate this perspective in a simple model of an
asymmetric dipolar fluid where the exact long-ranged interaction is known, and
in an ab initio water model where it is approximated.

are insufficient by themselves, as the visual appearance of a saliency map can
change significantly without the ranking of the scores being modified.

use them to predict the correct label (i.e. select-then-predict models).
Currently, these approaches are largely evaluated on in-domain settings. Yet,
little is known about how post-hoc explanations and inherently faithful models
perform in out-of-domain settings. In this paper, we conduct an extensive
empirical study that examines: (1) the out-of-domain faithfulness of post-hoc
explanations, generated by five feature attribution methods; and (2) the
out-of-domain performance of two inherently faithful models over six datasets.
Contrary to our expectations, results show that in many cases out-of-domain
post-hoc explanation faithfulness measured by sufficiency and comprehensiveness
is higher compared to in-domain. We find this misleading and suggest using a
random baseline as a yardstick for evaluating post-hoc explanation
faithfulness. Our findings also show that select-then predict models

  Self-Adaptive Systems: Research Directions",,,,,cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Self-adaptive systems continuously adapt to changes in their execution
environment. Capturing all possible changes to define suitable behaviour
beforehand is unfeasible, or even impossible in the case of unknown changes,
hence human intervention may be required. We argue that adapting to unknown
situations is the ultimate challenge for self-adaptive systems. Learning-based
approaches are used to learn the suitable behaviour to exhibit in the case of
unknown situations, to minimize or fully remove human intervention. While such
approaches can, to a certain extent, generalize existing adaptations to new
situations, there is a number of breakthroughs that need to be achieved before
systems can adapt to general unknown and unforeseen situations. We posit the
research directions that need to be explored to achieve unanticipated
adaptation from the perspective of learning-based self-adaptive systems. At
minimum, systems need to define internal representations of previously unseen
situations on-the-fly, extrapolate the relationship to the previously
encountered situations to evolve existing adaptations, and reason about the
feasibility of achieving their intrinsic goals in the new set of conditions. We
close discussing whether, even when we can, we should indeed build systems that
define their own behaviour and adapt their goals, without involving a human
supervisor.

matrix with labels, exploiting the affinity in a supervised way. Specifically,
we utilize the label to generate a multi-scale label affinity matrix as a
structural supervision, and we use a square root kernel to compute a non-local

loss called Affinity Regression loss (AR loss), which can be an auxiliary loss

deploying an intent detection model. Thus, these models should seamlessly adapt

emerge after deployment and they do not have training data. The few existing
models that target this setting rely heavily on the scarcely available training
data and overfit to seen intents data, resulting in a bias to misclassify
utterances with unseen intents into seen ones. We propose RIDE: an intent
detection model that leverages commonsense knowledge in an unsupervised fashion
to overcome the issue of training data scarcity. RIDE computes robust and
generalizable relationship meta-features that capture deep semantic
relationships between utterances and intent labels; these features are computed
by considering how the concepts in an utterance are linked to those in an

meta-features significantly increase the accuracy of detecting both seen and

hydrodynamic drag exerted by the surrounding fluid, namely air. We investigate
this drag experimentally and theoretically for a smooth long cylinder moving
along its axis. We then derive the equations describing the shape of the string
loop in the limit of vanishing string radius. The solutions present a critical
point, analogous to a hydraulic jump, separating a supercritical zone where the
wave velocity is smaller than the rope velocity, from a subcritical zone where
waves propagate faster than the rope velocity. This property could be leveraged

the superiority of graph neural networks (GNN) in learning complex

years. Most GNN-based SBRs are based on a strong assumption of adjacent

necessarily indicate dependency due to the uncertainty and complexity of user
behaviours. Therefore, the aforementioned assumption does not always hold in

introduction of false dependencies between items which are adjacent in a

between items which are not adjacent but are actually dependent. Such
deficiencies significantly downgrade accurate dependency learning and thus
reduce the recommendation performance. Aiming to address these deficiencies, we

non-orthogonal eigenvectors of the matrix that best approximates the one-step
temporal evolution of the multivariate samples. In the context of dynamical
system analysis, the extracted dynamic modes are a generalization of global
stability modes. We apply DMD to a data matrix whose rows are linearly
independent, additive mixtures of latent time series. We show that when the
latent time series are uncorrelated at a lag of one time-step then, in the
large sample limit, the recovered dynamic modes will approximate, up to a
column-wise normalization, the columns of the mixing matrix. Thus, DMD is a
time series blind source separation algorithm in disguise, but is different
from closely related second order algorithms such as the Second-Order Blind
Identification (SOBI) method and the Algorithm for Multiple Unknown Signals
Extraction (AMUSE). All can unmix mixed stationary, ergodic Gaussian time
series in a way that kurtosis-based Independent Components Analysis (ICA)
fundamentally cannot. We use our insights on single lag DMD to develop a
higher-lag extension, analyze the finite sample performance with and without
randomly missing data, and identify settings where the higher lag variant can
outperform the conventional single lag variant. We validate our results with

study of estimating photometric redshifts as a classification problem using
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and galaxy images with spectroscopic
redshifts. We focus on point estimates and propose a set of consecutive steps
for resolving the two biases based on CNN models, involving representation
learning with multi-channel outputs, balancing the training data and leveraging
soft labels. The residuals can be viewed as a function of spectroscopic
redshifts or photometric redshifts, and the biases with respect to these two

that resolving biases in the spectroscopic space is a prerequisite for
resolving biases in the photometric space. Experiments show that our methods
possess a better capability in controlling biases compared to benchmark
methods, and exhibit robustness under varying implementing and training
conditions provided with high-quality data. Our methods have promises for
future cosmological surveys that require a good constraint of biases, and may
be applied to regression problems and other studies that make use of

haloscopes, in which different international groups are currently involved, the
RADES group was established in 2016 with the goal of developing very sensitive
detection systems to be operated in dipole magnets. This review deals with the
work developed by this collaboration during its first five years, from the
first designs, based on the multi-cavity concept, aiming to increase the
haloscope volume and, so, to improve its sensitivity, their evolution, the data
acquisition design, and, finally, the first experimental run. Moreover, the
envisaged work within RADES, for both dipole and solenoid magnets, in the short
and medium term is also presented.

particles are subjected to a bistable potential the double-well shape of which
is tunable via a shape deformability parameter. Our objective is to examine the
impact of shape deformability on the order of transition in quantum tunneling
in the bistable system, and on the possible existence of exact solutions to the
transfer-integral operator associated with the partition function of the
system. The bistable potential is represented by a class composed of three
families of parametrized double-well potentials, whose minima and barrier
height can be tuned distinctly. It is found that the extra degree of freedom,
introduced by the shape deformability parameter, favors a first-order
transition in quantum tunneling, in addition to the second-order transition
predicted with the $\phi^4$ model. This first-order transition in quantum
tunneling, which is consistent with Chudnovsky's conjecture of the influence of
the shape of the potential barrier on the order of thermally-assisted
transitions in bistable systems, is shown to occur at a critical value of the
shape-deformability parameter which is the same for the three families of
parametrized double-well potentials. Concerning the statistical mechanics of
the system, the associate partition function is mapped onto a spectral problem
by means of the transfer-integral formalism. The condition that the partition
function can be exactly integrable, is determined by a criterion enabling exact
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the transfer-integral operator. Analytical
expressions of some of these exact eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are given,
and the corresponding ground-state wavefunctions are used to compute the
probability density which is relevant for calculations of thermodynamic
quantities such as the correlation functions and the correlation lengths.

of the concept of action-at-a-distance, which is at the foundation of nonlocal
elasticity. In contrast to existing approaches that adopts an integral
stress-strain constitutive relation, the displacement-driven approach is
predicated on an integral strain-displacement relation. The most remarkable
consequence of this reformulation is that the (total) strain energy is
guaranteed to be convex and positive-definite without imposing any constraint
on the symmetry of the kernels. This feature is critical to enable the
application of nonlocal formulations to general continua exhibiting asymmetric
interactions; ultimately a manifestation of material heterogeneity. Remarkably,
the proposed approach also enables a strong satisfaction of the locality
recovery condition and of the laws of thermodynamics, which are not foregone
conclusions in most classical nonlocal elasticity theories. Additionally, the
formulation is frame-invariant and the nonlocal operator remains physically
consistent at boundaries. The study is complemented by a detailed analysis of
the dynamic response of the nonlocal continuum and of its intrinsic dispersion
leading to the consideration that the choice of nonlocal kernels should depend
on the specific material. Examples of exponential or power-law kernels are
presented in order to demonstrate the applicability of the method to different
classes of nonlocal media. The ability to admit generalized kernels reinforces
the generalized nature of the displacement-driven approach over existing
integral methodologies, which typically lead to simplified differential models
based on exponential kernels. The theoretical formulation is also leveraged to
simulate the static response of nonlocal beams and plates illustrating the
intrinsic consistency of the approach, which is free from unwanted boundary
effects.

constraining galaxy evolution models. As 21-cm HI emission studies have been
largely restricted to low redshifts, the redshift evolution of the BTFR is less
studied. The upcoming LADUMA survey (Looking At the Distant Universe with the
MeerKAT Array) will address this. As preparation for LADUMA, we use the Simba
hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulation from the Simba-hires (25 h$^{-1}$
Mpc)$^{3}$ run to generate rotational velocity measures from galaxy rotation
curves ($V_{\rm flat}$) and HI spectral line profile widths ($W_{\rm 50}$ and
$W_{\rm 20}$) at three different redshifts ($z$ = 0, 0.5, and 1). Using these
measures, together with the dark matter velocity dispersion and halo mass, we
consider the redshift evolution of the BTFR of Simba galaxies. We find that
LADUMA will be successful in detecting weak redshift evolution of the BTFR,
provided that auxiliary data is used to distinguish galaxies with disky
morphologies. $W_{\rm 20}$ spectral line widths give lower scatter and more
pronounced redshift evolution compared to $W_{\rm 50}$. We also compare these
rotational velocity measures to the dark matter velocity dispersion across
redshift and galaxy morphology. We find weak redshift evolution between
rotational velocity and the dark matter halo mass, and provide fits for
estimating a galaxy's dark matter halo mass from HI spectral line widths. This
study with Simba showcases the importance of upcoming, deep SKA pathfinder
surveys such as LADUMA, and provides predictions to compare with redshift
evolution of the BTFR and galaxy dark matter content from HI rotational
velocity measures.

linear carbon chain (carbyne) using density functional theory (DFT) and the
random phase approximation (RPA) to the correlation energy. The studies are
performed in vacuo and for carbyne inside a carbon nano tube (CNT). In the
vacuum, semi-local DFT and RPA predict bond length alternations of about 0.04
{\AA} and 0.13 {\AA}, respectively. The frequency of the highest optical mode
at the $\Gamma$ point is 1219 cm$^{-1}$ and about 2000 cm$^{-1}$ for DFT and
the RPA. Agreement of the RPA to previous high level quantum chemistry and
diffusion Monte-Carlo results is excellent. For the RPA we calculate the
phonon-dispersion in the full Brillouine zone and find marked quantitative
differences to DFT calculations not only at the $\Gamma$ point but also
throughout the entire Brillouine zone. To model carbyne inside a carbon
nanotube, we considered a (10,0) CNT. Here the DFT calculations are even
qualitatively sensitive to the k-points sampling. At the limes of a very dense
k-points sampling, semi-local DFT predicts no bond length alternation (BLA),
whereas in the RPA a sizeable BLA of 0.09 {\AA} prevails. The reduced BLA leads
to a significant red shift of the vibrational frequencies of about 350
cm$^{-1}$, so that they are in good agreement with experimental estimates.
Overall, the good agreement between the RPA and previously reported results
from correlated wavefunction methods and experimental Raman data suggests that
the RPA provides reliable results at moderate computational costs. It hence
presents a useful addition to the repertoire of correlated wavefunction methods
and its accuracy clearly prevails for low dimensional systems, where semi-local
density functionals struggle to yield even qualitatively correct results.

The heavy loads of smoke particles emitted in the atmosphere reached the
Iberian Peninsula (IP) a few days later on 7 and 8 September. Satellite imagery
allows to identify two main smoke clouds emitted during two different periods
that were injected and transported in the atmosphere at several altitude
levels. Columnar properties on 7 and 8 September at two Aerosol Robotic Network

aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 440 nm up to 0.62, Angstrom exponent of 1.6-1.7,
large dominance of small particles (fine mode fraction > 0.88), low absorption
AOD at 440 nm (<0.008) and large single scattering albedo at 440 nm (>0.98).

refinements of programs with higher-order state, fine-grained concurrency,
polymorphism and recursive types. The core of ReLoC is its refinement judgment
$e \precsim e' : \tau$, which states that a program $e$ refines a program $e'$
at type $\tau$. ReLoC provides type-directed structural rules and symbolic
execution rules in separation-logic style for manipulating the judgment,
whereas in prior work on refinements for languages with higher-order state and
concurrency, such proofs were carried out by unfolding the judgment into its
definition in the model. ReLoC's abstract proof rules make it simpler to carry
out refinement proofs, and enable us to generalize the notion of logically
atomic specifications to the relational case, which we call logically atomic
relational specifications.
  We build ReLoC on top of the Iris framework for separation logic in Coq,
allowing us to leverage features of Iris to prove soundness of ReLoC, and to
carry out refinement proofs in ReLoC. We implement tactics for interactive
proofs in ReLoC, allowing us to mechanize several case studies in Coq, and
thereby demonstrate the practicality of ReLoC.
  ReLoC Reloaded extends ReLoC (LICS'18) with various technical improvements, a
new Coq mechanization, and support for Iris's prophecy variables. The latter
allows us to carry out refinement proofs that involve reasoning about the

on the baryonic and dark matter content of galaxies. It also serves as a
valuable cosmological probe by allowing us to measure the Hubble constant
independently of other methods. These applications all require the difficult
task of inverting the lens equation and simultaneously reconstructing the mass
profile of the lens along with the original light profile of the unlensed
source. As there is no reason for either the lens or the source to be simple,
we need methods that both invert the lens equation with a large number of
degrees of freedom and also enforce a well-controlled regularisation that
avoids the appearance of spurious structures. This can be beautifully
accomplished by representing signals in wavelet space. Building on the Sparse
Lens Inversion Technique (SLIT), in this work we present an improved
sparsity-based method that describes lensed sources using wavelets and
optimises over the parameters given an analytical lens mass profile. We apply
our technique on simulated HST and E-ELT data, as well as on real HST images of
lenses from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) sample, assuming a lens model. We show
that wavelets allow us to reconstruct lensed sources containing detailed
substructures when using both present-day data and high-resolution images from
future thirty-meter-class telescopes. Wavelets moreover provide a much more
tractable solution in terms of quality and computation time compared to using a
source model that combines smooth analytical profiles and shapelets. Requiring
very little human interaction, our pixel-based technique fits into the effort
to devise automated modelling schemes. It can be incorporated in the standard
workflow of sampling analytical lens model parameters. The method, which we
call SLITronomy, is freely available as a new plug-in to the modelling software
Lenstronomy.

wavelet domain, to make beginners understand the nature of watermarking in a
short time. Based on the theory of wavelet transform, this paper analyzed
statistical distributions of each level after transformation and the features
of watermark embedded in different transform levels. Through comparison and
analysis, we found that watermark was suitable for embedding into the
coefficients of the first four levels of wavelet transform. In current
state-of-art approaches, the embedding algorithms were always to replace the
coefficient values of the embedded positions. In contrast this paper proposed
an embedding algorithm of selfadaptive interpolation to achieve a better
imperceptibility. In order to reduce the computational complexity, we took a
pseudo random sequence with a length of 31 bits as the watermark. In the
experiments, watermark was embedded in different locations, including different
transform levels, high-frequency coefficients and low-frequency coefficients,
high-energy regions and low-frequency regions. Results showed that the
imperceptibility was better than traditional embedding algorithms. The bit
error rates of the extracted watermark were calculated and we analyzed the
robustness and fragility of each embedded signal. At last we concluded the best
embedding positions of watermark for different applications and our future
work.

topography upon femtosecond-fs pulsed laser irradiation. The method employs
spatially controlled double fs laser pulses to actively regulate the
hydrodynamic microfluidic motion of the melted layer that gives rise to the
structures formation. The pulse train used, in particular, consists of a
previously unexplored spatiotemporal intensity combination including one pulse
with Gaussian and another with periodically modulated intensity distribution
created by Direct Laser Interference Patterning (DLIP). The interpulse delay is
appropriately chosen to reveal the contribution of the microfluidic melt flow,
while it is found that the sequence of the Gaussian and DLIP pulses remarkably
influences the surface profile attained. Results also demonstrate that both the
spatial intensity of the double pulse and the effective number of pulses per
irradiation spot can further be modulated to control the formation of complex
surface morphologies. The underlying physical processes behind the complex
patterns generation were interpreted in terms of a multiscale model combining
electrodynamic excitation with melt hydrodynamics. We believe that this work
can constitute a significant step forward towards producing laser induced
surface structures on demand by tailoring the melt microfluidic phenomena.

where the generated samples by a single image transformation lie between ID and
OOD using a network trained on clean ID samples. To be specific, we make the
network classify the generated samples and calculate their mean classification
accuracy, using which we create a soft target label for them. We train the same

with the soft labels created for them. We detect OOD samples by thresholding
the entropy of the predicted softmax probability. The experimental results show
that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in the standard

show how these constraints could be potentially tremendously improved by the
next generation of Gravitational-Wave (GW) interferometers, extending to
lifetimes as short as $10^{-16}$ second. The key point is that these particles
may have dominated the energy density of the universe and have triggered a
period of matter domination at early times, until their decay before BBN. The
resulting modified cosmological history compared to the usually-assumed single
radiation era would imprint observable signatures in stochastic
gravitational-wave backgrounds of primordial origin. In particular, we show how
the detection of the GW spectrum produced by long-lasting sources such as
cosmic strings would provide a unique probe of particle physics parameters.
When applied to specific particle production mechanisms in the early universe,
these GW spectra could be used to derive new constraints on many UV extensions
of the Standard Model. We illustrate this on a few examples, such as
supersymmetric models where the mass scale of scalar moduli and gravitino can
be constrained up to $10^{10}$ GeV. Further bounds can be obtained on the

uncapacitated min-cost flow, or Wasserstein's metric, is an important and
well-studied problem that asks to find a flow of minimum cost that routes a
general demand vector. Adding to its importance, recent advancements in our
understanding of algorithms for transshipment have led to breakthroughs for the
fundamental problem of computing shortest paths. Specifically, the recent
near-optimal $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate single-source shortest path
algorithms in the parallel and distributed settings crucially solve
transshipment as a central step of their approach.
  The key property that differentiates transshipment from other similar
problems like shortest path is the so-called \emph{boosting}: one can boost a
(bad) approximate solution to a near-optimal $(1 + \varepsilon)$-approximate
solution. This conceptually reduces the problem to finding an approximate
solution. However, not all approximations can be boosted -- there have been
several proposed approaches that were shown to be susceptible to boosting, and
a few others where boosting was left as an open question.
  The main takeaway of our paper is that any black-box $\alpha$-approximate
transshipment solver that computes a \emph{dual} solution can be boosted to an
$(1 + \varepsilon)$-approximate solver. Moreover, we significantly simplify and
decouple previous approaches to transshipment (in sequential, parallel, and
distributed settings) by showing all of them (implicitly) obtain approximate
dual solutions.
  Our analysis is very simple and relies only on the well-known multiplicative
weights framework. Furthermore, to keep the paper completely self-contained, we
provide a new (and arguably much simpler) analysis of multiplicative weights
that leverages well-known optimization tools to bypass the ad-hoc calculations
used in the standard analyses.

machine learning through the lenses of structural econometrics models in which
the unknown index is the solution of a functional equation and issues of
endogeneity are explicitly accounted for. We model fairness as a linear
operator whose null space contains the set of strictly {\it fair} indexes. A
{\it fair} solution is obtained by projecting the unconstrained index into the
null space of this operator or by directly finding the closest solution of the
functional equation into this null space. We also acknowledge that policymakers
may incur a cost when moving away from the status quo. Achieving

hole (BH), and a dense concentration of self-gravitating fermionic dark matter
(DM) placed at the Galaxy centre, can explain the precise astrometric data
(positions and radial velocities) of the S-stars orbiting SgrA*. This result
encompasses the 17 best resolved S-stars, and includes the test of general
relativistic effects such as the gravitational redshift in the S2-star. In
addition, the DM model features another remarkable result: the dense core of
fermions is the central region of a continuous density distribution of DM whose
diluted halo explains the Galactic rotation curve. In this Letter, we
complement the above findings by analyzing in both models the relativistic
periapsis precession of the S2-star orbit. While the Schwarzschild BH scenario
predicts a unique prograde precession for S2, in the DM scenario it can be
either retrograde or prograde, depending on the amount of DM mass enclosed
within the S2 orbit, which in turn is a function of the DM fermion mass. We
show that all the current and publicly available data of S2 can not
discriminate between the two models, but upcoming S2 astrometry close to next
apocentre passage could potentially establish if SgrA* is governed by a
classical BH or by a quantum DM system.

derived from the parse tree of a sentence. The word similarity graph allows
nodes to share information with their neighbors since we argue that in emphasis
selection, similar words are more likely to be emphasized together. Graph
neural networks are employed to learn the representation of each node of these

in the Industry 4.0 era. Although robots have shown great success in
pick-and-place operations with rigid products, the autonomous shaping and
packing of elastic materials into compact boxes remains one of the most
challenging problems in robotics; The automation of packing tasks is crucial at
this moment given the accelerating shift towards e-commerce (which requires to
manipulate multiple types of materials). In this paper, we propose a new action
planning approach to automatically pack long linear elastic objects into
common-size boxes with a bimanual robotic system. For that, we developed an
efficient vision-based method to compute the objects' geometry and track its
deformation in real-time and without special markers; The algorithm filters and
orders the feedback point cloud that is captured by a depth sensor. A reference
object model is introduced to plan the manipulation targets and to complete
occluded parts of the object. Action primitives are used to construct
high-level behaviors, which enable the execution of all packing steps. To
validate the proposed theory, we conduct a detailed experimental study with
multiple types and lengths of objects and packing boxes. The proposed
methodology is original and its demonstrated manipulation capabilities have not
(to the best of the authors knowledge) been previously reported in the

phishing, hacking and shoulder surfing. Fingerprint matching (FPM) as an
alternative to PIN equally has a downside as fingerprints reside on individual

banks in Brunei established that majority (65%) of them preferred use of
biometric authentication methods. In this work, we propose a two-level
integrated authentication mechanism (2L-IAM). At the first level, the user logs
in to their IB portal using either PIN or FPM. At the second level, user is
authenticated by means of face recognition (FR) should they initiate a
transaction classified as sensitive. The merits of the introduced 2L-IAM are
3-fold: - (1) FR guarantees the identity of the rightful user irrespective of
the login device; (2) By classifying banking products sensitivity, the
sensitive transactions are more effectively secured; (3) It is accommodative of
different users authentication preferences. Adoption of this framework could
thus improve both users and banks experiences in terms of enhanced security and
service delivery respectively.

paper introduces geometric regularization and explores potential applicability
to several unexplained phenomenon including double descent, the differences
between wide and deep networks, the benefits of He initialization and retained
proximity in training, gradient confusion, fitness landscape properties, double
descent in other learning paradigms, and other findings for overparameterized
learning. Experiments are conducted by aggregating histograms of loss values
corresponding to randomly sampled initializations in small setups, which find
directional correlations in zero or central mode dominance from deviations in
width, depth, and initialization distributions. Double descent is likely due to
a regularization phase change when a training path reaches low enough loss that
the loss manifold volume contraction from a reduced range of potential weight
sets is amplified by an overparameterized geometry.

process, but most computational models adopt a storage view. In this work, we
propose a computational model for generative episodic memory. It is based on
the central hypothesis that the hippocampus stores and retrieves selected
aspects of an episode as a memory trace, which is necessarily incomplete. At
recall, the neocortex reasonably fills in the missing information based on
general semantic information in a process we call semantic completion.
  As episodes we use images of digits (MNIST) augmented by different
backgrounds representing context. Our model is based on a VQ-VAE which
generates a compressed latent representation in form of an index matrix, which
still has some spatial resolution. We assume that attention selects some part
of the index matrix while others are discarded, this then represents the gist
of the episode and is stored as a memory trace. At recall the missing parts are
filled in by a PixelCNN, modeling semantic completion, and the completed index
matrix is then decoded into a full image by the VQ-VAE.
  The model is able to complete missing parts of a memory trace in a
semantically plausible way up to the point where it can generate plausible
images from scratch. Due to the combinatorics in the index matrix, the model
generalizes well to images not trained on. Compression as well as semantic
completion contribute to a strong reduction in memory requirements and
robustness to noise. Finally we also model an episodic memory experiment and
can reproduce that semantically congruent contexts are always recalled better
than incongruent ones, high attention levels improve memory accuracy in both
cases, and contexts that are not remembered correctly are more often remembered
semantically congruently than completely wrong.

oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast has been conventionally focused on
probing gray matter, the BOLD contrast in white matter having been generally
disregarded. Recent results have provided evidence of the functional
significance of the white matter BOLD signal, showing at the same time that its
correlation structure is highly anisotropic, and related to the diffusion
tensor in shape and orientation. This evidence suggests that conventional
isotropic Gaussian filters are inadequate for denoising white matter fMRI data,
since they are incapable of adapting to the complex anisotropic domain of white
matter axonal connections. In this paper we explore a graph-based description
of the white matter developed from diffusion MRI data, which is capable of

generation that need to be kept in dynamic balance. Today, when it comes to
renewable energy generation, such decisions are increasingly made in a
liberalized electricity market environment, where future power generation must
be offered through contracts and auction mechanisms, hence based on forecasts.
The increased share of highly intermittent power generation from renewable
energy sources increases the uncertainty about the expected future power
generation. Point forecast does not account for such uncertainties. To account
for these uncertainties, it is possible to make probabilistic forecasts. This
work first presents important concepts and approaches concerning probabilistic
forecasts with deep learning. Then, deep learning models are used to make
probabilistic forecasts of day-ahead power generation from a wind power plant
located in Northern Norway. The performance in terms of obtained quality of the
prediction intervals is compared for different deep learning models and sets of
covariates. The findings show that the accuracy of the predictions improves
when historical data on measured weather and numerical weather predictions
(NWPs) were included as exogenous variables. This allows the model to
auto-correct systematic biases in the NWPs using the historical measurement
data. Using only NWPs, or only measured weather as exogenous variables, worse
prediction performances were obtained.

power divided by the angular velocity $\Omega_*$. This means that the length of
the lever arm of the angular momentum extracted by the photons, relativistic
particles and wind must be on average $c/\Omega_*$, which is known as the light
cylinder radius. Therefore, any deposition of the rotation power within the
light cylinder causes insufficient loss of angular momentum. In this paper, we
investigate two cases of this type of energy release: polar cap acceleration
and Ohmic heating in the magnetospheric current inside the star. As for the
first case, the outer magnetosphere beyond the light cylinder is found to
compensate the insufficient loss of the angular momentum. We argue that the
energy flux coming from the sub-rotating magnetic field lines must be larger
than the solid-angle average value, and as a result, an enhanced energy flux
emanating beyond the light cylinder is observed in different phases in the
light curve from those of emission inside the light cylinder. As for the second
case, the stellar surface rotates more slowly than the stellar interior. We
find that the way the magnetospheric current closes inside the star is linked
to how the angular momentum is transferred inside the star. We obtain numerical
solutions which show that the magnetospheric current inside the star spreads
over the polar cap magnetic flux embedded in the star in such a way that
electromotive force is gained efficiently.

approximately 4 Crab in the \(20-50\) keV, energy range the source was
monitored across the electromagnetic spectrum with detections from radio to
hard X-ray frequencies. Using these multi-wavelength observations, we analyzed
quasi-simultaneous observations from 12 April, near the peak of the outburst
(\(\sim 23\) March). Spectral analysis of the hard X-rays found a \(kT_e \sim
30 \) keV and \( \tau \sim 2\) with a \texttt{CompTT} model, indicative of an
accreting black hole binary in the hard state. The flat/inverted radio spectrum
and the accretion disk winds seen at optical wavelengths are also consistent
with the hard state. Then we constructed a spectral energy distribution
spanning \(\sim 12\) orders of magnitude using modelling in \texttt{JetSeT}.
The model is composed of an irradiated disk with a Compton hump and a leptonic
jet with an acceleration region and a synchrotron-dominated cooling region.
\texttt{JetSeT} finds the spectrum is dominated by jet emission up to
approximately \(10^{14}\) Hz after which disk and coronal emission dominate.
The acceleration region has a magnetic field of \( B \sim 1.6 \times 10^4 \) G,
a cross section of \(R \sim 2.8 \times 10^{9} \) cm, and a flat radio spectral
shape naturally obtained from the synchroton cooling of the accelerated
electrons. The jet luminosity of \(> 8 \times 10^{37} \) erg/s (\(>
0.15L_{Edd}\)) compared to an accretion luminosity of \( \sim 6 \times
10^{37}\) erg/s, assuming a distance of 3 kpc. Because these two values are
comparable, it is possible the jet is powered predominately via accretion with
only a small contribution needed from the Blanford-Znajek mechanism from the
reportedly slowly spinning black hole.

problem independently of its domain, because they are able to detect what the
problem is and to choose the appropriate background knowledge according to the
context. For instance, presented with the string ""8/17/2017"" to be transformed
to ""17th of August of 2017"", humans will process this in two steps: (1) they
recognise that it is a date and (2) they map the date to the 17th of August of
2017. Inductive Programming (IP) aims at learning declarative (functional or
logic) programs from examples. Two key advantages of IP are the use of
background knowledge and the ability to synthesise programs from a few
input/output examples (as humans do). In this paper we propose to use IP as a
means for automating repetitive data manipulation tasks, frequently presented
during the process of {\em data wrangling} in many data manipulation problems.
Here we show that with the use of general-purpose declarative (programming)

domains can be automatically solved from very few examples. We also propose an
integrated benchmark for data wrangling, which we share publicly for the

However, its resource-intensive nature makes it challenging to implement on
constrained embedded devices, particularly where available hardware resources
can vary at run-time. We propose a dynamic machine translation model that
scales the Transformer architecture based on the available resources at any
particular time. The proposed approach, 'Dynamic-HAT', uses a HAT
SuperTransformer as the backbone to search for SubTransformers with different
accuracy-latency trade-offs at design time. The optimal SubTransformers are
sampled from the SuperTransformer at run-time, depending on latency
constraints. The Dynamic-HAT is tested on the Jetson Nano and the approach uses
inherited SubTransformers sampled directly from the SuperTransformer with a
switching time of <1s. Using inherited SubTransformers results in a BLEU score
loss of <1.5% because the SubTransformer configuration is not retrained from
scratch after sampling. However, to recover this loss in performance, the
dimensions of the design space can be reduced to tailor it to a family of
target hardware. The new reduced design space results in a BLEU score increase
of approximately 1% for sub-optimal models from the original design space, with
a wide range for performance scaling between 0.356s - 1.526s for the GPU and

contact with micropatterned molds that yields porous phenolic resin dual-use
stamps with topographically micropatterned contact surfaces. With these stamps,
two different parallel additive substrate manufacturing methods can be
executed: capillary stamping and decal transfer microlithography. Under
moderate contact pressures, the porous phenolic resin stamps are used for
non-destructive ink transfer to substrates by capillary stamping. Continuous
ink supply through the pore systems to the contact surfaces of the porous
phenolic resin stamps enables multiple successive stamp-substrate contacts for
lithographic ink deposition under ambient conditions. No deterioration of the
quality of the deposited pattern occurs and no interruptions for ink
replenishment are required. Under high contact pressure, porous phenolic resin
stamps are used for decal transfer printing. In this way, the tips of the
stamps' contact elements are lithographically transferred to counterpart
substrates. The granular nature of the phenolic resin facilitates the rupture
of the contact elements upon stamp retraction. The deposited phenolic resin
micropatterns characterized by abundance of exposed hydroxyl groups are used as
generic anchoring sites for further application-specific functionalizations. As
example, we deposited phenolic resin micropatterns on quartz crystal
microbalance resonators and further functionalized them with polyethylenimine
for preconcentration sensing of humidity and gaseous formic acid. We envision
that also preconcentration coatings for other sensing methods, such as
attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance
spectroscopy, are accessible by this functionalization algorithm

cryptographic primitive in which users register into a key generation centre

suffer from a high number and large size of messages exchanged in the Key
Management Protocol (KMP). To overcome this, an MP-NIKE scheme can eliminate
the airtime and latency of messages transferred between IoT devices. MP-NIKE
schemes can be realized by using multilinear maps. There are several attempts
for constructing multilinear maps based on indistinguishable obfuscation,
lattices and the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). Nevertheless, these schemes
are inefficient in terms of computation cost and memory overhead. Besides,
several attacks have been recently reported against CRT-based and lattice-based
multilinear maps. There is only one modular exponentiation-based MP-NIKE scheme
in the literature which has been claimed to be both secure and efficient. In
this article, we present an attack on this scheme based on the Euclidean

that brings the power of mimicking the global context of the input image. For
better performance, ViT needs large-scale training data. To overcome this data
hunger limitation, many ViT-based networks, or hybrid-ViT, have been proposed
to include local context during the training. The robustness of ViTs and its
variants against adversarial attacks has not been widely investigated in the
literature like CNNs. This work studies the robustness of ViT variants 1)
against different Lp-based adversarial attacks in comparison with CNNs, 2)
under adversarial examples (AEs) after applying preprocessing defense methods
and 3) under the adaptive attacks using expectation over transformation (EOT)
framework. To that end, we run a set of experiments on 1000 images from
ImageNet-1k and then provide an analysis that reveals that vanilla ViT or
hybrid-ViT are more robust than CNNs. For instance, we found that 1) Vanilla
ViTs or hybrid-ViTs are more robust than CNNs under Lp-based attacks and under
adaptive attacks. 2) Unlike hybrid-ViTs, Vanilla ViTs are not responding to
preprocessing defenses that mainly reduce the high frequency components.

three decades, and its remarkable successes and achievements. LHCb was
conceived primarily as a b-physics experiment, dedicated to CP violation
studies and measurements of very rare b decays, however the tremendous
potential for c-physics was also clear. At first data taking, the versatility
of the experiment as a general-purpose detector in the forward region also
became evident, with measurements achievable such as electroweak physics, jets
and new particle searches in open states. These were facilitated by the
excellent capability of the detector to identify muons and to reconstruct decay
vertices close to the primary pp interaction region. By the end of the LHC Run
2 in 2018, before the accelerator paused for its second long shut down, LHCb
had measured the CKM quark mixing matrix elements and CP violation parameters
to world-leading precision in the heavy-quark systems. The experiment had also
measured many rare decays of b and c quark mesons and baryons to below their
Standard Model expectations, some down to branching ratios of order 10-9. In
addition, world knowledge of b and c spectroscopy had improved significantly
through discoveries of many new resonances already anticipated in the quark
model, and also adding new exotic four and five quark states.

which epoch(s) possibly source the $H_0$-tension. We consider Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) data in three possible ways: $i)$ complete CMB data; $ii)$
excluding the $l<30$ temperature and polarization likelihoods; $iii)$ imposing
early universe priors, that disentangle early and late time physics. Through a
joint analysis with low-redshift supernovae type-Ia and gravitationally lensed
time delay datasets, {and neglecting galaxy clustering Baryonic Acoustic
Oscillation (BAO) data}, we find that the inclusion of early universe CMB
priors is consistent with the local estimate of $H_0$ while excluding the
low-$l$+lowE likelihoods mildly relaxes the tension. This is in contrast to
joint analyses with the complete CMB data. Our simple implementation of
contrasting the effect of different CMB priors on the $H_0$ estimate shows that
the early universe information from the CMB data when decoupled from late-times
physics could be in agreement with a higher value of $H_0$. {We also find no
evidence for the early dark energy model using only the early universe physics
within the CMB data. Finally using the BAO data in different redshift ranges to
perform inverse distance ladder analysis, we find that the early universe
modifications, while being perfectly capable of alleviating the $H_0$-tension
when including the BAO galaxy clustering data, would be at odds with the
Ly-$\alpha$ BAO data due to the difference in $r_{\rm d}\, vs.\, H_0$
correlation between the two BAO datasets.} We therefore infer and speculate
that source for the $H_0$-tension between CMB and local estimates could
possibly originate in the modeling of late-time physics within the CMB
analysis. This in turn recasts the $H_0$-tension as an effect of late-time
physics in CMB, instead of the current early-time CMB vs. local late-time
physics perspective.

The parameters of PTMs are distributed on the Internet and may suffer backdoor
attacks. In this work, we demonstrate the universal vulnerability of PTMs,
where fine-tuned PTMs can be easily controlled by backdoor attacks in arbitrary
downstream tasks. Specifically, attackers can add a simple pre-training task,
which restricts the output representations of trigger instances to pre-defined
vectors, namely neuron-level backdoor attack (NeuBA). If the backdoor
functionality is not eliminated during fine-tuning, the triggers can make the
fine-tuned model predict fixed labels by pre-defined vectors. In the
experiments of both natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV),
we show that NeuBA absolutely controls the predictions for trigger instances
without any knowledge of downstream tasks. Finally, we apply several defense

benefits from the exceptional photo-physical properties of both electrons and
holes in the material. Here, we directly probe the free-carrier dynamics in
Cs-doped FAPbI3 thin films by spatiotemporal photoconductivity imaging. Using
charge transport layers to selectively quench one type of carriers, we show
that the two relaxation times on the order of 1 microsecond and 10 microseconds
correspond to the lifetimes of electrons and holes in FACsPbI3, respectively.
Strikingly, the diffusion mapping indicates that the difference in
electron/hole lifetimes is largely compensated by their disparate mobility.
Consequently, the long diffusion lengths (3 ~ 5 micrometers) of both carriers
are comparable to each other, a feature closely related to the unique charge
trapping and de-trapping processes in hybrid trihalide perovskites. Our results
unveil the origin of superior diffusion dynamics in this material, crucially
important for solar-cell applications.

classification of clean and noisy samples, where samples classified as noisy
are re-labelled and ""MixMatched"" with the clean samples. These methods have two
issues in large noise rate problems: 1) the noisy set is more likely to contain
hard samples that are in-correctly re-labelled, and 2) the number of samples
produced by MixMatch tends to be reduced because it is constrained by the small
clean set size. In this paper, we introduce the learning algorithm PropMix to
handle the issues above. PropMix filters out hard noisy samples, with the goal
of increasing the likelihood of correctly re-labelling the easy noisy samples.
Also, PropMix places clean and re-labelled easy noisy samples in a training set
that is augmented with MixUp, removing the clean set size constraint and
including a large proportion of correctly re-labelled easy noisy samples. We
also include self-supervised pre-training to improve robustness to high noisy
label scenarios. Our experiments show that PropMix has state-of-the-art (SOTA)
results on CIFAR-10/-100(with symmetric, asymmetric and semantic label noise),
Red Mini-ImageNet (from the Controlled Noisy Web Labels), Clothing1M and

the shape and size of the overlap region, which are sensitive to the shape of
colliding atomic nuclei. The Pearson correlation coefficient between $v_2$ and
$[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$, $\rho_2$, was found to be particularly sensitive to the
quadrupole deformation parameter $\beta$ that is traditionally measured in low

the prolate deformation $\beta<0$ enhances the value of $\rho_2$. As $\beta>0$

phenomena, such as melting and solidification, arising in numerous science and

Differential Equation (PDE) of the temperature distribution defined on a

liquid-solid interface and its dynamics are governed by an Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE). The PDE-ODE coupling at the boundary is nonlinear
and creates a significant challenge for state estimation with provable
convergence and robustness. This tutorial article presents a state estimation
method based on PDE backstepping for the Stefan system, using measurements only
at the moving boundary. PDE backstepping observer design generates an observer
gain by employing a Volterra transformation of the observer error state into a
desirable target system, solving a Goursat-form PDE for the transformation's
kernel, and performing a Lyapunov analysis of the target observer error system.
The observer is applied to models of problems motivated by climate change and
the need for renewable energy storage: a model of polar ice dynamics and a
model of charging and discharging in lithium-ion batteries. The numerical
results for polar ice demonstrate a robust performance of the designed
estimator with respect to the unmodeled salinity effect in sea ice. The results
for an electrochemical PDE model of a lithium-ion battery with a phase

making it impossible to explore the environment further. The Brain Storm
Optimization (BSO) algorithm imitates a group of humans in solving problems

optimal solution for particular optimization problems. Furthermore, with a
suitable clustering operation, it has better multi-modal optimization
performance, i.e., it can find multiple optima in the objective space. By

  of functionally graded material","40 pages, 28 figures",,,,cs.CE,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Differential equations are indispensable to engineering and hence to
innovation. In recent years, physics-informed neural networks (PINN) have
emerged as a novel method for solving differential equations. PINN method has
the advantage of being meshless, scalable, and can potentially be intelligent
in terms of transferring the knowledge learned from solving one differential
equation to the other. The exploration in this field has majorly been limited
to solving linear-elasticity problems, crack propagation problems. This study
uses PINNs to solve coupled thermo-mechanics problems of materials with
functionally graded properties. An in-depth analysis of the PINN framework has
been carried out by understanding the training datasets, model architecture,
and loss functions. The efficacy of the PINN models in solving thermo-mechanics
differential equations has been measured by comparing the obtained solutions
either with analytical solutions or finite element method-based solutions.
While R2 score of more than 99% has been achieved in predicting primary
variables such as displacement and temperature fields, achieving the same for
secondary variables such as stress turns out to be more challenging. This study
is the first to implement the PINN framework for solving coupled
thermo-mechanics problems on composite materials. This study is expected to
enhance the understanding of the novel PINN framework and will be seminal for
further research on PINNs.

Numerous efforts either try to patch weaknesses in trained models, or try to
make it difficult or costly to compute adversarial examples that exploit them.
In our work, we explore a new ""honeypot"" approach to protect DNN models. We
intentionally inject trapdoors, honeypot weaknesses in the classification
manifold that attract attackers searching for adversarial examples. Attackers'
optimization algorithms gravitate towards trapdoors, leading them to produce
attacks similar to trapdoors in the feature space. Our defense then identifies
attacks by comparing neuron activation signatures of inputs to those of
trapdoors. In this paper, we introduce trapdoors and describe an implementation
of a trapdoor-enabled defense. First, we analytically prove that trapdoors
shape the computation of adversarial attacks so that attack inputs will have
feature representations very similar to those of trapdoors. Second, we
experimentally show that trapdoor-protected models can detect, with high
accuracy, adversarial examples generated by state-of-the-art attacks (PGD,
optimization-based CW, Elastic Net, BPDA), with negligible impact on normal
classification. These results generalize across classification domains,
including image, facial, and traffic-sign recognition. We also present
significant results measuring trapdoors' robustness against customized adaptive
attacks (countermeasures).

association between a perceived auditory stimulus and a temporally asynchronous

from vision and language. NICO uses this information to make decisions about
when to extend conversations in order to accrue more affective information if
the representation of the association is not coherent. Our primary contribution
is providing a NICO robot with the ability to learn the affective associations
between a perceived auditory stimulus and an emotional expression. NICO is able
to do this for both individual subjects and specific stimuli, with the aid of
an emotion-driven dialogue system that rectifies emotional expression
incoherences. The robot is then able to use this information to determine a
subject's enjoyment of perceived auditory stimuli in a real HRI scenario.

every year. Early and correct diagnosis is vital to avoid health complexities,
however, it depends upon the availability of costly microscopes and trained

potential to not only decrease the burden of experts but also improve
diagnostic accuracy on low-cost microscopes. However, this is hampered by the
absence of a reasonable size dataset. One of the most challenging aspects is
the reluctance of the experts to annotate the dataset at low magnification on
low-cost microscopes. We present a dataset to further the research on malaria
microscopy over the low-cost microscopes at low magnification. Our large-scale
dataset consists of images of blood-smear slides from several malaria-infected
patients, collected through microscopes at two different cost spectrums and
multiple magnifications. Malarial cells are annotated for the localization and
life-stage classification task on the images collected through the high-cost
microscope at high magnification. We design a mechanism to transfer these
annotations from the high-cost microscope at high magnification to the low-cost

adaptation methods are presented as the baselines. Furthermore, a partially

to work on the images collected from the low-cost microscope. The dataset will
be made publicly available after publication.

systems and inverter-dominated microgrids (MGs), in which frequency dynamics
constraints are developed to optimize the amount of load restoration and
guarantee the dynamic performance of system frequency response during the

be sectionalized into several isolated MGs to restore critical loads and
tripped non-black start distributed generations (DGs) by black start DGs.
However, the high penetration of inverter-based DGs reduces the system inertia,
which results in low-inertia issues and large frequency fluctuation during the
restoration process. To address this challenge, we propose a two-level
simulation-assisted sequential service restoration model, which includes a
mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based optimization model and a
transient simulation model. The proposed MILP model explicitly incorporates the
frequency response into constraints, by interfacing with transient simulation
of inverter-dominated MGs. Numerical results on a modified IEEE 123-bus system
have validated that the frequency dynamic performance of the proposed service

electricity prices, and they can perceive as unfair price differentiation in
the same local area. For these reasons, nodal prices in distribution networks
are rarely employed. However, the increasing availability of renewable
resources and emerging price-elastic behaviours pave the way for the effective
introduction of marginal nodal pricing schemes in distribution networks. The
aim of the proposed framework is to show how traditional non-flexible consumers
can coexist with flexible users in a local distribution area. Flexible users
will pay nodal prices, whereas non-flexible consumers will be charged a fixed
price derived from the underlying nodal prices. Moreover, the developed
approach shows how a distribution system operator should manage the local grid
by optimally determining the lines to be expanded, and the collected network
tariff levied on grid users, while accounting for both congestion rent and
investment costs. The proposed model is formulated as a non-linear integer
bilevel program, which is then recast as an equivalent single optimization
problem, by using integer algebra and complementarity relations. The power
flows in the distribution area are modelled by resorting to a second-order cone
relaxation, whose solution is exact for radial networks under mild assumptions.
The final model results in a mixed-integer quadratically constrained program,

(LCS) problem. The fastest algorithm for solving the LCS problem exactly runs
in essentially quadratic time in the length of the input, and it is known that
under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis the quadratic running time cannot
be beaten. There are no such limitations for the approximate computation of the
LCS however, except in some limited scenarios. There is also a scarcity of
approximation algorithms. When the two given strings are over an alphabet of
size $k$, returning the subsequence formed by the most frequent symbol
occurring in both strings achieves a $1/k$ approximation for the LCS. It is an
open problem whether a better than $1/k$ approximation can be achieved in truly
subquadratic time ($O(n^{2-\delta})$ time for constant $\delta>0$).
  A recent result [Rubinstein and Song SODA'2020] showed that a $1/2+\epsilon$
approximation for the LCS over a binary alphabet is possible in truly
subquadratic time, provided the input strings have the same length. In this
paper we show that if a $1/2+\epsilon$ approximation (for $\epsilon>0$) is
achievable for binary LCS in truly subquadratic time when the input strings can
be unequal, then for every constant $k$, there is a truly subquadratic time
algorithm that achieves a $1/k+\delta$ approximation for $k$-ary alphabet LCS
for some $\delta>0$. Thus the binary case is the hardest. We also show that for
every constant $k$, if one is given two strings of \emph{equal} length over a
$k$-ary alphabet, one can obtain a $1/k+\epsilon$ approximation for some
constant $\epsilon>0$ in truly subquadratic time, thus extending the Rubinstein
