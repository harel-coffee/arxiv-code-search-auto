2104.0981,Weiwen Xu,"Weiwen Xu, Ai Ti Aw, Yang Ding, Kui Wu, Shafiq Joty",Addressing the Vulnerability of NMT in Input Perturbations,Accepted by NAACL 2021 Industry Track,,,,cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has achieved significant breakthrough in
performance but is known to suffer vulnerability to input perturbations. As
real input noise is difficult to predict during training, robustness is a big
issue for system deployment. In this paper, we improve the robustness of NMT
models by reducing the effect of noisy words through a Context-Enhanced
Reconstruction (CER) approach. CER trains the model to resist noise in two
steps: (1) perturbation step that breaks the naturalness of input sequence with
made-up words; (2) reconstruction step that defends the noise propagation by
generating better and more robust contextual representation. Experimental
results on Chinese-English (ZH-EN) and French-English (FR-EN) translation tasks
demonstrate robustness improvement on both news and social media text. Further
fine-tuning experiments on social media text show our approach can converge at
a higher position and provide a better adaptation.

workhorse for qualitative and quantitative analysis of materials. Recent
developments in LIBS have been limited either to signal enhancement strategies
or to advances in data analysis techniques that yield better interpretation of
LIBS data. Explorations of the initial laser excitation stage of LIBS remain
somewhat restricted. In particular, the influence, if any, of the polarization
state of excitation laser remains unexplored to a large extent. The current
work addresses this lacuna in knowledge by probing the influence of different
polarization states of the excitation laser on LIBS spectra of metallic copper.
Specifically, we investigate the behaviour of atomic and ionic emission lines
with respect to change in polarization state of the incident laser light; our
results show distinct polarization dependence. Our observations open up new
opportunities of tackling the problem of relatively faint emissions from ionic
species in the plasma by adjusting the polarization state of the laser. Our
findings also highlight the urgent need for appropriate theoretical study to be
undertaken so that proper insights can be developed into the physics that drive
the observations that we report here.

universe after the quantum chromodynamics phase transition, when axions acquire
masses. Both axions and magnetic fields are supposed to be spatially
inhomogeneous. We derive the equations for the spatial spectra of these fields,
which depend on conformal time. In case of the magnetic field, we deal with the
spectra of the energy density and the magnetic helicity density. The evolution
equations are obtained in the closed form within the mean field approximation.
We choose the parameters of the system and the initial condition which
correspond to realistic primordial magnetic fields and axions. The system of
equations for the spectra is solved numerically. We study the evolution of the
fields for different seed spectra of axions. We find that the mutual
interaction between axions and magnetic fields is suppressed for the chosen
realistic parameters of the system, that is in agreement with previous results
where only the zero mode of axions was accounted for.

internal combustion engines operate under high pressures that surpass the
thermodynamic critical limit of fuel-oxidizer mixtures. These conditions
require the consideration of complex fluid behaviors that pose challenges for
numerical simulations, casting doubts on the validity of existing subgrid-scale
(SGS) models in large-eddy simulations of these systems. While data-driven
methods have shown high accuracy as closure models in simulations of turbulent
flames, these models are often criticized for lack of physical
interpretability, wherein they provide answers but no insight into their
underlying rationale. The objective of this study is to assess SGS stress
models from conventional physics-driven approaches and an interpretable machine
learning algorithm, i.e., the random forest regressor, in a turbulent
transcritical non-premixed flame. To this end, direct numerical simulations
(DNS) of transcritical liquid-oxygen/gaseous-methane (LOX/GCH4) inert and
reacting flows are performed. Using this data, a priori analysis is performed
on the Favre-filtered DNS data to examine the accuracy of physics-based and
random forest SGS-models under these conditions. SGS stresses calculated with
the gradient model show good agreement with the exact terms extracted from
filtered DNS. The accuracy of the random-forest regressor decreased when
physics-based constraints are applied to the feature set. Results demonstrate
that random forests can perform as effectively as algebraic models when
modeling subgrid stresses, only when trained on a sufficiently representative
database. The employment of random forest feature importance score is shown to
provide insight into discovering subgrid-scale stresses through sparse
regression.

families of random semi-regular graphs that have higher algebraic connectivity
than a random $d$-regular graphs with the same number of vertices and edges. On
the other hand, we show that regular graphs beat semi-regular graphs when
$d\geq8.$ More generally, we study random semi-regular graphs whose average
degree is $d$, not necessary an integer. This provides a natural generalization
of a $d$-regular graph in the case of a non-integer $d.$ We characterise their
algebraic connectivity in terms of a root of a certain 6th-degree polynomial.
Finally, we construct a small-world-type network of average degree 2.5 with a
relatively high algebraic connectivity. We also propose some related open
problems and conjectures.

through automatically discovered 3D keypoints. We cast this as the problem of
aligning a source 3D object to a target 3D object from the same object
category. Our method analyzes the difference between the shapes of the two
objects by comparing their latent representations. This latent representation
is in the form of 3D keypoints that are learned in an unsupervised way. The
difference between the 3D keypoints of the source and the target objects then
informs the shape deformation algorithm that deforms the source object into the
target object. The whole model is learned end-to-end and simultaneously
discovers 3D keypoints while learning to use them for deforming object shapes.
Our approach produces intuitive and semantically consistent control of shape
deformations. Moreover, our discovered 3D keypoints are consistent across
object category instances despite large shape variations. As our method is
unsupervised, it can be readily deployed to new object categories without
requiring annotations for 3D keypoints and deformations.

Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to characterize their atmospheric composition and
search for signs of habitability or life. These planets may undergo significant
atmospheric and ocean loss due to the superluminous pre-main-sequence phase of
their host stars, which may leave behind abiotically-generated oxygen, a false
positive for the detection of life. Determining if ocean loss has occurred will
help assess potential habitability and whether or not any O2 detected is
biogenic. In the solar system, differences in isotopic abundances have been
used to infer the history of ocean loss and atmospheric escape (e.g. Venus,
Mars). We find that isotopologue measurements using transit transmission
spectra of terrestrial planets around late-type M dwarfs like TRAPPIST-1 may be
possible with JWST, if the escape mechanisms and resulting isotopic
fractionation were similar to Venus. We present analyses of post-ocean-loss O2-
and CO2-dominated atmospheres, containing a range of trace gas abundances.
Isotopologue bands are likely detectable throughout the near-infrared (1-8 um),
especially 3-4 um, although not in CO2-dominated atmospheres. For Venus-like
D/H ratios 100 times that of Earth, TRAPPIST-1 b transit signals of up to 79
ppm are possible by observing HDO. Similarly, 18O/16O ratios 100 times that of
Earth produce signals at up to 94 ppm. Detection at S/N=5 may be attained on
these bands with as few as four to eleven transits, with optimal use of JWST
NIRSpec Prism. Consequently, H2O and CO2 isotopologues could be considered as
indicators of past ocean loss and atmospheric escape for JWST observations of
terrestrial planets around M dwarfs.

procedure and investigate for the first time its behaviour from the frequentist
point of view. Given a spike-and-slab prior on the high-dimensional sparse
unknown parameter, one can easily compute posterior probabilities of coming
from the spike, which correspond to the well known local-fdr values, also
called $\ell$-values. The spike-and-slab weight parameter is calibrated in an
empirical Bayes fashion, using marginal maximum likelihood. The multiple
testing procedure under study, called here the cumulative $\ell$-value
procedure, ranks coordinates according to their empirical $\ell$-values and
thresholds so that the cumulative ranked sum does not exceed a user-specified
level $t$.
  We validate the use of this method from the multiple testing perspective: for
alternatives of appropriately large signal strength, the false discovery rate
(FDR) of the procedure is shown to converge to the target level $t$, while its
false negative rate (FNR) goes to $0$. We complement this study by providing
convergence rates for the method. Additionally, we prove that the $q$-value
multiple testing procedure shares similar convergence rates in this model.

times, limiting the depth of algorithms that may be successfully implemented.
Here we demonstrate that, despite these limitations, it is possible to
implement long-time, high fidelity simulations on current hardware.
Specifically, we simulate an XY-model spin chain on the Rigetti and IBM quantum
computers, maintaining a fidelity of at least 0.9 for over 600 time steps. This
is a factor of 150 longer than is possible using the iterated Trotter method.
Our simulations are performed using a new algorithm that we call the fixed
state Variational Fast Forwarding (fsVFF) algorithm. This algorithm decreases
the circuit depth and width required for a quantum simulation by finding an
approximate diagonalization of a short time evolution unitary. Crucially, fsVFF
only requires finding a diagonalization on the subspace spanned by the initial
state, rather than on the total Hilbert space as with previous methods,
substantially reducing the required resources. We further demonstrate the
viability of fsVFF through large numerical implementations of the algorithm, as
well as an analysis of its noise resilience and the scaling of simulation

2104.00526,Partha Mitra,Partha P Mitra,Fitting Elephants,,,,,cs.LG cs.AI q-bio.NC,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Textbook wisdom advocates for smooth function fits and implies that
interpolation of noisy data should lead to poor generalization. A related
heuristic is that fitting parameters should be fewer than measurements (Occam's
Razor). Surprisingly, contemporary machine learning (ML) approaches, cf. deep
nets (DNNs), generalize well despite interpolating noisy data. This may be
understood via Statistically Consistent Interpolation (SCI), i.e. data
interpolation techniques that generalize optimally for big data. In this
article we elucidate SCI using the weighted interpolating nearest neighbors
(wiNN) algorithm, which adds singular weight functions to kNN (k-nearest
neighbors). This shows that data interpolation can be a valid ML strategy for
big data. SCI clarifies the relation between two ways of modeling natural
phenomena: the rationalist approach (strong priors) of theoretical physics with
few parameters and the empiricist (weak priors) approach of modern ML with more
parameters than data. SCI shows that the purely empirical approach can
successfully predict. However data interpolation does not provide theoretical
insights, and the training data requirements may be prohibitive. Complex animal
brains are between these extremes, with many parameters, but modest training
data, and with prior structure encoded in species-specific mesoscale circuitry.
Thus, modern ML provides a distinct epistemological approach different both
from physical theories and animal brains.

In particular we provide sufficient conditions such that asymptotic equivalence

hinges on a characterization of such processes by a property of the
corresponding covariance kernel introduced by Doob. In order to demonstrate
that the given assumptions on the Gauss-Markov process are in some sense sharp

lattice theta functions as building blocks. We first derive asymptotic and
numerical results showing the (non-)maximality of the triangular lattice with
respect to the Gaussian parameter and the size of the firing field. In a
particular case where the size of the firing fields and the lattice spacing
match with experiments, we have numerically checked that it is possible to find
a value for the Gaussian parameter above which the triangular lattice is always
optimal. In the case of a radially symmetric distribution of firing locations,
we also characterize all the lattices that are critical points for the Fisher
Information at fixed scales belonging to an open interval (we call these
lattices ""volume stationary""). It allows us to compare the Fisher Information
of a finite number of lattices in dimension 2 and 3 and to give another
evidences of the optimality of the triangular and FCC lattices.

dominate many areas of computer vision, and image denoising is no exception.
Neural networks can learn by example to map noisy images to clean images.
However, access to noisy/clean or even noisy/noisy image pairs isn't always
readily available in the desired domain. Recent approaches have allowed for the
denoising of single noisy images without access to any training data aside from
that very image. But since they require both training and inference to be
carried out on each individual input image, these methods require significant
computation time. As such, they are difficult to integrate into automated
microscopy pipelines where denoising large datasets is essential but needs to
be carried out in a timely manner. Here we present Noise2Fast, a fast single
image blind denoiser. Our method is tailored for speed by training on a
four-image dataset produced using a unique form of downsampling we refer to as
""checkerboard downsampling"". Noise2Fast is faster than all tested approaches
and is more accurate than all except Self2Self, which takes well over 100 times
longer to denoise an image. This allows for a combination of speed and
flexibility that was not previously attainable using any other method.

mechanisms in GPUs make writing correct kernels difficult. Data races pose one
such concurrency correctness challenge, and therefore, effective methods of
detecting as many data races as possible are required.
  Predictive partial order relations for CPU programs aim to expose data races
that can be hidden during a dynamic execution. Existing predictive partial
orders cannot be na\""ively applied to analyze GPU kernels because of the
differences in programming models. This work proposes GWCP, a predictive
partial order for data race detection of GPU kernels. GWCP extends a sound and
precise relation called weak-causally-precedes (WCP) proposed in the context of
multithreaded shared memory CPU programs to GPU kernels. GWCP takes into
account the GPU thread hierarchy and different synchronization semantics such
as barrier synchronization and scoped atomics and locks.
  We implement a tool called PreDataR that tracks the GWCP relation using
binary instrumentation. PreDataR includes three optimizations and a novel
vector clock compression scheme that are readily applicable to other partial
order based analyses. Our evaluation with several microbenchmarks and
benchmarks shows that PreDataR has better data race coverage compared to prior
techniques at practical run-time overheads.

Adoption of the data Shapley Value (SV), a cooperative game theoretical
approach, is an intelligent valuation solution to tackle the issue of noisy
labels. Data SV can be used together with a learning model and an evaluation
metric to validate each training point's contribution to the model's
performance. The SV of a data point, however, is not unique and depends on the
learning model, the evaluation metric, and other data points collaborating in
the training game. However, effects of utilizing different evaluation metrics
for computation of the SV, detecting the noisy labels, and measuring the data
points' importance has not yet been thoroughly investigated. In this context,
we performed a series of comparative analyses to assess SV's capabilities to
detect noisy input labels when measured by different evaluation metrics. Our
experiments on COVID-19-infected of CT images illustrate that although the data
SV can effectively identify noisy labels, adoption of different evaluation
metric can significantly influence its ability to identify noisy labels from
different data classes. Specifically, we demonstrate that the SV greatly
depends on the associated evaluation metric.

binary black holes (BBHs) by space gravitational-wave interferometers. In
particular, targeting BBHs with component masses around 5-100$M_\odot$, we
directly incorporate the chirp mass distribution of the 62 BBHs detected at
high significance. We find that, due to the reduction of both the comoving
merger rate and a weighted average of chirp masses, the expected detection
numbers are generally much smaller than the results obtained by the same
authors immediately after the report of GW150914. For LISA, the total BBH
detections are estimated to be $N_{\rm tot}\sim 2 (T/4{\rm yr})^{3/2}(\rho_{\rm
thr}/10)^{-3}$, dominated by nearly monochromatic BBHs ($\rho_{\rm thr}$: the
detection threshold, $T$: the observational period). TianQin will have a total
detection number $N_{\rm tot}$ similar to LISA. Meanwhile, TianQin has
potential to find $N_{\rm mer}\sim0.6 (T/4{\rm yr})^{7/4}(\rho_{\rm
thr}/10)^{-3}$ BBHs that merge in the observational period. This number for
merging BBHs is 4-5 times larger than that of LISA, because of the difference
between the optimal bands. We also investigate prospects for joint operations
of multiple detectors, finding that concurrent observations will be more
advantageous than sequential ones.

to estimate the cosmological properties in a large redshift range. Our group

divided into two stages. In the first stage, which corresponds to the latent
period, infectious individuals can travel. However, in the second stage, the
same individuals cannot travel since they are seriously ill. Final size
distributions of the metapopulation SIR and SHIR models are simulated with two
different methods and compared. In Monte Carlo simulations, in which the
population is treated as an integer, the distributions show similar behavior.
However, in reaction-diffusion systems, in which the population is treated as a
real number, the final size distribution of the SHIR model has a discontinuous
jump, and that of the SIR model shows a continuous transition. The
discontinuous jump is found to be an artifact that occurs owing to an

This model is applied throughout the entire lifespan of a device to track

confronted with challenging issues such as scaling limits and path discovery in
the THz frequencies. Therefore, this work exploits the potential of leaky-wave
antennas in the dense THz networks, to establish low-complexity THz links. By
addressing the propagation angle-frequency coupling effects, the transmission
rate is analyzed. The results show that the leaky-wave antenna is efficient for
achieving the high-speed transmission rate. The co-channel interference
management is unnecessary when the THz transmitters with large subchannel
bandwidths are not extremely dense. A simple subchannel allocation solution is
proposed, which enhances the transmission rate compared with the same number of
subchannels with the equal allocation of the frequency band. After subchannel
allocation, a low-complexity power allocation method is proposed to improve the
energy efficiency.

  Framework","17 pages, 9 figures",,,,cs.AI cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Urban region profiling can benefit urban analytics. Although existing studies
have made great efforts to learn urban region representation from multi-source
urban data, there are still three limitations: (1) Most related methods focused
merely on global-level inter-region relations while overlooking local-level
geographical contextual signals and intra-region information; (2) Most previous
works failed to develop an effective yet integrated fusion module which can
deeply fuse multi-graph correlations; (3) State-of-the-art methods do not
perform well in regions with high variance socioeconomic attributes. To address
these challenges, we propose a multi-graph representative learning framework,
called Region2Vec, for urban region profiling. Specifically, except that human
mobility is encoded for inter-region relations, geographic neighborhood is
introduced for capturing geographical contextual information while POI side
information is adopted for representing intra-region information by knowledge
graph. Then, graphs are used to capture accessibility, vicinity, and
functionality correlations among regions. To consider the discriminative
properties of multiple graphs, an encoder-decoder multi-graph fusion module is
further proposed to jointly learn comprehensive representations. Experiments on
real-world datasets show that Region2Vec can be employed in three applications
and outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Particularly, Region2Vec has
better performance than previous studies in regions with high variance
socioeconomic attributes.

gradient beliefs about richly structured world states. We model listeners'
update of their prior beliefs about the causal structure of the world and the
joint probabilities of the consequent and antecedent based on assumptions about
the speaker's utterance production protocol. We show that, when supplied with
natural contextual assumptions, our model uniformly explains a number of
inferences attested in the literature, including epistemic inferences,
Conditional Perfection and the dependency between antecedent and consequent of
a conditional. We argue that this approach also helps explain three puzzles

decrease or remain unchanged.

model training, and wireless communications. However, due to the privacy
concerns of devices and limited computation or communication resource of UAVs,
it is impractical to send raw data of devices to UAV servers for model
training. Moreover, due to the dynamic channel condition and heterogeneous
computing capacity of devices in UAV-enabled networks, the reliability and
efficiency of data sharing require to be further improved. In this paper, we
develop an asynchronous federated learning (AFL) framework for
multi-UAV-enabled networks, which can provide asynchronous distributed
computing by enabling model training locally without transmitting raw sensitive
data to UAV servers. The device selection strategy is also introduced into the
AFL framework to keep the low-quality devices from affecting the learning
efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, we propose an asynchronous advantage
actor-critic (A3C) based joint device selection, UAVs placement, and resource
management algorithm to enhance the federated convergence speed and accuracy.
Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed framework and algorithm
achieve higher learning accuracy and faster federated execution time compared

Marriage problem with Incomplete lists (SMI). In particular, we seek stable
matchings that are optimal with respect to profile, which is a vector that

have their first-choice partner, and subject to this, the maximum number of

matching $M$, the minimum number of agents have their $d$th-choice partner, and
subject to this, the minimum number of agents have their $(d-1)$th-choice

Irving et al. [18] presented an $O(nm^2\log n)$ algorithm for finding a
rank-maximal stable matching, which can be adapted easily to the generous
stable matching case, where $n$ is the number of men / women and $m$ is the
number of acceptable man-woman pairs. An $O(n^{0.5}m^{1.5})$ algorithm for the
rank-maximal stable matching problem was later given by Feder [7]. However
these approaches involve the use of weights that are in general exponential in
$n$. In this paper we present an $O(nm^2\log n)$ algorithm for finding a
rank-maximal stable matching using a vector-based approach that involves
weights that are polynomially-bounded in $n$. We conduct an empirical
evaluation, and show how this approach has a far reduced memory requirement (an
estimated $100$-fold improvement for instances with $100, 000$ men or women)
when compared to Irving et al.'s algorithm above. Additionally, we show how to
adapt our algorithm for the generous case. Finally, we examine the complexity
of the problem of finding profile-based optimal stable matchings in the Stable

past decade due to advances in computing power and crystal structure prediction
algorithms (CSPA). However, the computational cost of the \textit{ab initio}
calculations required by CSPA limits its utility to small unit cells, reducing
the compositional and structural space the algorithms can explore. Past studies
have bypassed many unneeded \textit{ab initio} calculations by utilizing
machine learning methods to predict formation energy and determine the
stability of a material. Specifically, graph neural networks display high
fidelity in predicting formation energy. Traditionally graph neural networks
are trained on large data sets of relaxed structures. Unfortunately, the
geometries of unrelaxed candidate structures produced by CSPA often deviate
from the relaxed state, which leads to poor predictions hindering the model's
ability to filter energetically unfavorable prior to \textit{ab initio}
evaluation. This work shows that the prediction error on relaxed structures
reduces as training progresses, while the prediction error on unrelaxed
structures increases, suggesting an inverse correlation between relaxed and
unrelaxed structure prediction accuracy. To remedy this behavior, we propose a
simple, physically motivated, computationally cheap perturbation technique that
augments training data to improve predictions on unrelaxed structures
dramatically. On our test set consisting of 623 Nb-Sr-H hydride structures, we
found that training a crystal graph convolutional neural networks, utilizing
our augmentation method, reduced the MAE of formation energy prediction by 66\%
compared to training with only relaxed structures. We then show how this error
reduction can accelerates CSPA by improving the model's ability to filter out
energetically unfavorable structures accurately.

groups of similar instances. The similarity objective, however, is not
sufficient in applications where a fair-representation of the groups in terms
of protected attributes like gender or race, is required for each cluster.
Moreover, in many applications, to make the clusters useful for the end-user, a
balanced cardinality among the clusters is required. Our motivation comes from
the education domain where studies indicate that students might learn better in
diverse student groups and of course groups of similar cardinality are more
practical e.g., for group assignments. To this end, we introduce the
fair-capacitated clustering problem that partitions the data into clusters of
similar instances while ensuring cluster fairness and balancing cluster
cardinalities. We propose a two-step solution to the problem: i) we rely on
fairlets to generate minimal sets that satisfy the fair constraint and ii) we
propose two approaches, namely hierarchical clustering and partitioning-based
clustering, to obtain the fair-capacitated clustering. The hierarchical
approach embeds the additional cardinality requirements during the merging step
while the partitioning-based one alters the assignment step using a knapsack
problem formulation to satisfy the additional requirements. Our experiments on
four educational datasets show that our approaches deliver well-balanced
clusters in terms of both fairness and cardinality while maintaining a good

applied to image and multi-media tasks, particularly those with structured
data. More recently, there has been more attention to unstructured data that
can be represented via graphs. These types of data are often found in health
and medicine, social networks, and research data repositories. Graph
convolutional neural networks have recently gained attention in the field of
deep learning that takes advantage of graph-based data representation with
automatic feature extraction via convolutions. Given the popularity of these
methods in a wide range of applications, robust uncertainty quantification is
vital. This remains a challenge for large models and unstructured datasets.
Bayesian inference provides a principled approach to uncertainty quantification
of model parameters for deep learning models. Although Bayesian inference has
been used extensively elsewhere, its application to deep learning remains
limited due to the computational requirements of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) methods. Recent advances in parallel computing and advanced proposal
schemes in MCMC sampling methods has opened the path for Bayesian deep
learning. In this paper, we present Bayesian graph convolutional neural
networks that employ tempered MCMC sampling with Langevin-gradient proposal
distribution implemented via parallel computing. Our results show that the
proposed method can provide accuracy similar to advanced optimisers while
providing uncertainty quantification for key benchmark problems.

For these kernels, we also show that the top eigenvalue (and an approximate

analysis (PCA). We show that the first component (PC1) is related to solar
cycle, and accounts for 41.5 % of the variance of the data. The second
component (PC2) is related to 22-year Hale cycle, and explains 23.6% of the
variance of the data. The PC1 time series of aa cycles 10-23 has only one peak
in its power spectrum at the period 10.95 years, which is the average solar
cycle period for the interval SC10-SC23. The PC2 time series of the same cycles
has a clear peak at period 21.90 (Hale cycle) and a smaller peak at 3/4 of that
period. We also study the principal component of sunspot numbers (SSN) for
cycles 10-23, and compare mutual behavior of the PC2 components of aa-index and
SSN PCA analyses. We note that they are in the same phase in all other cycles
than Solar Cycles 15 and 20. The aa cycle 20 also differs from other even aa
cycles in its shape, especially in anomalously high peaks during its descending
phase. Even though there is a coherence in the PC2 time series phases of
aa-index and sunspot number, this effect is too small to cause all of the
difference of the shape of even and odd aa cycles. We estimate that 30% of the
shape of the PC2 component of aa-index is due to sunspot number and the rest to
other recurrent events in Sun/solar-wind. The first maximum of aa-data (typical
to odd cycles), during sunspot maximum, has been shown to be related to coronal
mass ejections (CME), while the second maximum (typical to even cycles) in the
declining phase of cycle, is probably related to high-speed streams (HSS). The
last events increase the activity level such that the minimum between even-odd
cycle-pair is always higher than the minimum between succeeding odd-even cycle
pair.

additionally use the redundant information on their energy ($\textit{E}$) to
enhance the contrast between groupings. For this endeavour, we use
$\textit{Gaia}$ EDR3 based measurements of $170$ globular clusters, $41$
streams and $46$ satellites to derive their $\mathbf{J}$ and $\textit{E}$. To
detect groups, we use the $\texttt{ENLINK}$ software, coupled with a
statistical procedure that accounts for the observed phase-space uncertainties
of these objects. We detect a total of $N=6$ groups, including the previously
known mergers $\textit{Sagittarius}$, $\textit{Cetus}$,
$\textit{Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus}$, $\textit{LMS-1/Wukong}$,
$\textit{Arjuna/Sequoia/I'itoi}$ and one new merger that we call
$\textit{Pontus}$. All of these mergers, together, comprise $62$ objects
($\approx 25\%$ of our sample). We discuss their members, orbital properties

showing it to be the most metal-poor merger. The global dynamical atlas of

recommender systems, we study the top-$k$ extreme contextual bandits problem,
where the total number of arms can be enormous, and the learner is allowed to
select $k$ arms and observe all or some of the rewards for the chosen arms. We
first propose an algorithm for the non-extreme realizable setting, utilizing
the Inverse Gap Weighting strategy for selecting multiple arms. We show that
our algorithm has a regret guarantee of $O(k\sqrt{(A-k+1)T \log
(|\mathcal{F}|T)})$, where $A$ is the total number of arms and $\mathcal{F}$ is
the class containing the regression function, while only requiring
$\tilde{O}(A)$ computation per time step. In the extreme setting, where the

arm hierarchy model that induces a certain structure in mean rewards to ensure
statistical and computational efficiency. The hierarchical structure allows for
an exponential reduction in the number of relevant arms for each context, thus
resulting in a regret guarantee of $O(k\sqrt{(\log A-k+1)T \log

linear function class and show superior performance with respect to well-known

what mechanisms mediate long-ranged mechanical interactions in the systems. Two

which are relatively sparse, in which most of the large scale momentum transfer

comparing the probabilities of generating two sentences given the same context.
The proposed framework is able to generate high-quality, large-scale dataset

the literature about the presence of Na I in the atmosphere of HD209458 b,
based on low- and high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. Methods. We
generated synthetic planetary atmosphere models and we compared them with the
transmission light curves and spectra observed in previous studies. Our models
account for the stellar limb-darkening and Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effects,
and contemplate various possible scenarios for the planetary atmosphere.
Results. We reconciled the discrepant results by identifying a range of
planetary atmospheres that are consistent with previous low- and
high-resolution spectroscopic observations. Either both datasets are
interpreted as consistent with a total absence of Na I in the planetary
atmosphere (with Hubble Space Telescope data being affected by limb darkening),
or the terminator temperature of HD209458 b has to have an upper limit of about
1000K. In particular, we find that 1D transmission spectra with
lower-than-equilibrium temperatures can also explain the previously reported
detection of absorption signal at low resolution due to differential transit
depth in adjacent bands, while the cores of the Na I D lines may be masked by
the strong RM signal seen at high resolution. We also rule out high-altitude
clouds, which would otherwise mask the absorption signal at low resolution, as
the source of the discrepancies. Conclusions. This work highlights the
synergies between different observing techniques, specifically low- and
high-resolution spectroscopy, to fully characterise transiting exoplanet
systems.

distance-based adaptive coding and modulation (ACM) scheme to support
aeronautical communication applications, by exploiting the high spectral
efficiency of large-scale antenna arrays and link adaption. Our RZF-TPC aided
and distance-based ACM scheme switches its mode according to the distance
between the communicating aircraft. We derive the closed-form asymptotic
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) expression of the RZF-TPC for
the aeronautical channel, which is Rician, relying on a non-centered channel
matrix that is dominated by the deterministic line-of-sight component. The
effects of both realistic channel estimation errors and of the co-channel
interference are considered in the derivation of this approximate closed-form
SINR formula. Furthermore, we derive the analytical expression of the optimal
regularization parameter that minimizes the mean square detection error. The
achievable throughput expression based on our asymptotic approximate SINR
formula is then utilized as the design metric for the proposed RZF-TPC aided
and distance-based ACM scheme. Monte-Carlo simulation results are presented for
validating our theoretical analysis as well as for investigating the impact of
the key system parameters. The simulation results closely match the theoretical
results. In the specific example that two communicating aircraft fly at a
typical cruising speed of 920 km/h, heading in opposite direction over the

Transformer with CNN in varying degrees. However, their combinations are
loosely-coupled and do not make full use of CNN. To address this issue, we
propose the concept of tightly-coupled convolutional Transformer(TCCT) and
three TCCT architectures which apply transformed CNN architectures into
Transformer: (1) CSPAttention: through fusing CSPNet with self-attention
mechanism, the computation cost of self-attention mechanism is reduced by 30%
and the memory usage is reduced by 50% while achieving equivalent or beyond
prediction accuracy. (2) Dilated causal convolution: this method is to modify
the distilling operation proposed by Informer through replacing canonical
convolutional layers with dilated causal convolutional layers to gain
exponentially receptive field growth. (3) Passthrough mechanism: the
application of passthrough mechanism to stack of self-attention blocks helps
Transformer-like models get more fine-grained information with negligible extra
computation costs. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that our TCCT
architectures could greatly improve the performance of existing state-of-art

Fourier sums, i.e., real signals which can be represented as sparse exponential
sums of the form $f(t) = \sum_{j=1}^{K} \gamma_{j} \, \cos(2\pi a_{j} t +
b_{j})$, where the frequency parameters $a_{j} \in {\mathbb R}$ (or $a_{j} \in

recently proposed stable iterative rational approximation algorithm in
\cite{NST18}. For signal reconstruction we use a set of classical Fourier
coefficients of $f$ with regard to a fixed interval $(0, P)$ with $P>0$. Even
though all terms of $f$ may be non-$P$-periodic, our reconstruction method
requires at most $2K+2$ Fourier coefficients $c_{n}(f)$ to recover all
parameters of $f$. We show that in the case of exact data, the proposed
iterative algorithm terminates after at most $K+1$ steps. The algorithm can
also detect the number $K$ of terms of $f$, if $K$ is a priori unknown and
$L>2K+2$ Fourier coefficients are available. Therefore our method provides a
new stable alternative to the known numerical approaches for the recovery of
exponential sums that are based on Prony's method.

scratch, especially when training data is scarce and computation power is
limited. In deep learning, a typical strategy for transfer learning is to
freeze the early layers of a pre-trained model and fine-tune the rest of its
layers on the target domain. Previous work focuses on the accuracy of the
transferred model but neglects the transfer of adversarial robustness. In this
work, we first show that transfer learning improves the accuracy on the target
domain but degrades the inherited robustness of the target model. To address
such a problem, we propose a novel cooperative adversarially-robust transfer
learning (CARTL) by pre-training the model via feature distance minimization
and fine-tuning the pre-trained model with non-expansive fine-tuning for target
domain tasks. Empirical results show that CARTL improves the inherited
robustness by about 28% at most compared with the baseline with the same degree
of accuracy. Furthermore, we study the relationship between the batch
normalization (BN) layers and the robustness in the context of transfer
learning, and we reveal that freezing BN layers can further boost the
robustness transfer.

also span different levels of abstraction. The example command ``go to the
kitchen before going to the second floor'' contains spatial abstraction, given
that ``floor'' consists of individual rooms that can also be referred to in
isolation (""kitchen"", for example). There is also a temporal ordering of
events, defined by the word ""before"". Previous works have used Linear Temporal
Logic (LTL) to interpret temporal language (such as ""before""), and Abstract
Markov Decision Processes (AMDPs) to interpret hierarchical abstractions (such
as ""kitchen"" and ""second floor""), separately. To handle both types of commands
at once, we introduce the Abstract Product Markov Decision Process (AP-MDP), a
novel approach capable of representing non-Markovian reward functions at
different levels of abstractions. The AP-MDP framework translates LTL into its
corresponding automata, creates a product Markov Decision Process (MDP) of the
LTL specification and the environment MDP, and decomposes the problem into
subproblems to enable efficient planning with abstractions. AP-MDP performs
faster than a non-hierarchical method of solving LTL problems in over 95% of
tasks, and this number only increases as the size of the environment domain
increases. We also present a neural sequence-to-sequence model trained to
translate language commands into LTL expression, and a new corpus of
non-Markovian language commands spanning different levels of abstraction. We
test our framework with the collected language commands on a drone,
demonstrating that our approach enables a robot to efficiently solve temporal

generalized (continuous) Nash game (referred to as generalized Nash equilibrium
problem (GNEP)) where each player's feasible strategy set depends on the other
players' strategies. The method is based on a new form of Lagrangian function
with a quadratic approximation. First, we reformulate a GNEP as a saddle point
computation problem using the new Lagrangian and establish equivalence between
a saddle point of the Lagrangian and an equilibrium of the GNEP. We then
propose a simple algorithm that is convergent to the saddle point. Furthermore,
we establish global convergence by assuming that the Lagrangian function
satisfies the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property. A distinctive feature of our
analysis is to make use of the new Lagrangian as a potential function to guide
the iterate convergence. Our method has two novel features over existing
approaches: (i) it requires neither boundedness assumptions on the strategy set
and the set of multipliers of each player, nor any boundedness assumptions on
the iterates generated by the algorithm; (ii) it leads to a Jacobi-type
decomposition scheme, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first
development of a distributed algorithm to solve a general class of GNEPs.
Numerical experiments are performed on benchmark test problems and the results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Furthermore, no eclipses are seen in the observations at observing frequencies
ranging from 310 to 2700MHz. The optical VRI light curves were modulated with
the orbital period, reaching maximum brightness of $V=26.8$, $R=25.4$, and
$I=23.8$ at superior conjunction of the companion, confirming irradiation of
the companion by the pulsar. Modelling the light curves indicates that the
companion is likely not filling its Roche lobe, while having a moderate

the detection of PBH binary mergers of mass around $10^{-5} M_\odot$ if they

exhibit persistently narrow HeI lines, and whose bolometric light curves are
typically fast evolving and overluminous at peak relative to standard Type Ibc
SNe. We explore the interaction scenario of such Type Ibn SNe by performing
radiation-hydrodynamics and radiative-transfer calculations. We find that
standard-energy helium-star explosions within dense wind-like circumstellar
material (CSM) can reach on day timescales a peak luminosity of a few 10^44
erg/s, reminiscent of exceptional events like AT2018cow. Similar interactions
but with weaker winds can lead to Type Ibc SNe with double-peak light curves
and peak luminosities in the range ~10^42.2 to ~10^43 erg/s. In contrast, the
narrow spectral lines and modest peak luminosities of most Type Ibn SNe are
suggestive of a low-energy explosion in an initially <~5 Msun helium star, most
likely arising from interacting binaries, and colliding with a massive
helium-rich, probably ejecta-like, CSM at ~10^15 cm. Nonlocal thermodynamic
equilibrium radiative-transfer simulations of a slow-moving dense shell born
out and powered by the interaction compare favorably to Type Ibn SNe like
2006jc, 2011hw, or 2018bcc at late times and suggest a composition made of
about 50% helium, a solar metallicity, and a total ejecta/CSM mass of 1-2Msun.
A lower fractional helium abundance leads to weak or absent HeI lines and thus
excludes more massive configurations for observed Type Ibn SNe. Further, the
dominance of FeII emission below 5500A seen in Type Ibn SNe at late times is
not predicted at low metallicity. Hence, despite their promising properties,
Type Ibn SNe from pulsational-pair instability in very massive stars, which
requires low metallicity, have probably not yet been observed.

research, it is urgent to find a robust and effective denoising method to
retain morphological features for further texture analysis and segmentation.
Conventional denoising filters and models can easily suppress perturbative
noises in high contrast images. However, for low photon budget multi-photon
images, high detector gain will not only boost signals, but also bring huge
background noises. In such stochastic resonance regime of imaging,
sub-threshold signals may be detectable with the help of noises. Therefore, a
denoising filter that can smartly remove noises without sacrificing the
important cellular features such as cell boundaries is highly desired. In this
paper, we propose a convolutional neural network based autoencoder method,
Fully Convolutional Deep Denoising Autoencoder (DDAE), to improve the quality
of Three-Photon Fluorescence (3PF) and Third Harmonic Generation (THG)
microscopy images. The average of the acquired 200 images of a given location
served as the low-noise answer for DDAE training. Compared with other widely
used denoising methods, our DDAE model shows better signal-to-noise ratio (26.6
and 29.9 for 3PF and THG, respectively), structure similarity (0.86 and 0.87
for 3PF and THG, respectively), and preservation of nuclear or cellular

unusually massive, $25-65M_\odot$, black holes, it is now clear that 20\% of
all reported events comprise modest mass black holes, $5-15M_\odot$, like the
stellar black holes in the Milky Way. We show that such stellar mass black hole
binaries (BBH) if magnified by lensing galaxies can be detected at high
redshift, 1$< $z$ <$5, with chirp masses increased by $1+z$, accounting for the
majority of apparently high mass BBH events. This simple lensing explanation is
manifested by the evident bimodality of BBH chirp masses now visible, with 80\%
of BBH events in a broad peak centered on $m_{chirp} \simeq 35M_\odot$, and
20\% of BBH events in a narrow, low mass peak at $m_{chirp} \simeq 8.5M_\odot$,
matching well our prediction for lensed and unlensed events respectively. This
lensing interpretation is reinforced by the ""graveyard plot"" when ranked by
chirp mass, revealing a jump in chirp mass at $m_{chirp} \simeq 10M_\odot$ that
we show is caused by the large redshift difference between unlensed events with
$z<0.3$ and lensed events above $z>1$. Furthermore, nearly all BBH events are
seen to share a component mass ratio of $m_1/m_2=1.45\pm0.03$, indicating a
common stellar origin for BBH events across all chirp masses. This observed
component mass uniformity implies most binary black holes seldom pair up by
random capture, instead we may conclude that massive progenitor stars of BBH
black holes typically formed in-situ, in a well defined way over the full span
of cosmic time accessed through gravitational lensing.

of many types of diseases as well as for assisting current researches regarding
vascular systems. The automated analysis of blood vessels typically requires
the identification, or segmentation, of the blood vessels in an image or a set
of images, which is usually a challenging task. Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) have been shown to provide excellent results regarding the segmentation
of blood vessels. One important aspect of CNNs is that they can be trained on
large amounts of data and then be made available, for instance, in image
processing software for wide use. The pre-trained CNNs can then be easily
applied in downstream blood vessel characterization tasks such as the
calculation of the length, tortuosity, or caliber of the blood vessels. Yet, it
is still unclear if pre-trained CNNs can provide robust, unbiased, results on
downstream tasks when applied to datasets that they were not trained on. Here,
we focus on measuring the tortuosity of blood vessels and investigate to which
extent CNNs may provide biased tortuosity values even after fine-tuning the
network to the new dataset under study. We show that the tortuosity values
obtained by a CNN trained from scratch on a dataset may not agree with those
obtained by a fine-tuned network that was pre-trained on a dataset having
different tortuosity statistics. In addition, we show that the improvement in
segmentation performance when fine-tuning the network does not necessarily lead
to a respective improvement on the estimation of the tortuosity. To mitigate
the aforementioned issues, we propose the application of specific data
augmentation techniques even in situations where they do not improve
segmentation performance.

modify an image based on input sketches from users. Existing methods typically
formulate this task as a conditional inpainting problem, which requires users
to draw an extra mask indicating the region to modify in addition to sketches.
The masked regions are regarded as holes and filled by an inpainting model
conditioned on the sketch. With this formulation, paired training data can be
easily obtained by randomly creating masks and extracting edges or contours.
Although this setup simplifies data preparation and model design, it
complicates user interaction and discards useful information in masked regions.
To this end, we investigate a new paradigm of sketch-based image manipulation:
mask-free local image manipulation, which only requires sketch inputs from
users and utilizes the entire original image. Given an image and sketch, our
model automatically predicts the target modification region and encodes it into
a structure agnostic style vector. A generator then synthesizes the new image
content based on the style vector and sketch. The manipulated image is finally
produced by blending the generator output into the modification region of the
original image. Our model can be trained in a self-supervised fashion by
learning the reconstruction of an image region from the style vector and
sketch. The proposed method offers simpler and more intuitive user workflows
for sketch-based image manipulation and provides better results than previous
approaches. More results, code and interactive demo will be available at

for testing the interaction among the NCBR2 subsystems, supporting
interoperability and robustness requirements verification. The FEM is modelled

quasi-brittle fracture in an Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation, where a
second-order phase-field equation controls the damage evolution. The numerical
formulation adapts in space and time to bound the errors, solving the mesh-bias
issues these models typically suffer. The time-step adaptivity estimates the
temporal truncation error of the partial differential equation that governs the
solid equilibrium. The second-order generalized-$\alpha$ time-marching scheme
evolves the dynamic system. We estimate the temporal error by extrapolating a
first-order approximation of the present time-step solution using previous ones
with backward difference formulas; the estimate compares the extrapolation with
the time-marching solution. We use an adaptive scheme built on a residual
minimization formulation in space. We estimate the spatial error by enriching
the discretization with elemental bubbles; then, we localize an error indicator
norm to guide the mesh refinement as the fracture propagates. The combined
space and time adaptivity allows us to use low-order linear elements in
problems involving complex stress paths. We efficiently and robustly use
low-order spatial discretizations while avoiding mesh bias in structured and
unstructured meshes. We demonstrate the method's efficiency with numerical

are therefore required to have good psychometric properties, like
unidimensionality. In many cases the sum score is used in combination with a
threshold to decide between pass or fail, for instance. Here we consider
whether such a decision function is appropriate, without a latent variable
model, and which properties of a decision function are desirable. We consider
reliability (stability) of the decision function, i.e., does the decision
change upon perturbations, or changes in a fraction of the outcomes of the
items (measurement error). We are concerned with questions of whether the sum
score is the best way to aggregate the items, and if so why. We use ideas from
test theory, social choice theory, graphical models, computer science and
probability theory to answer these questions. We conclude that a weighted sum
score has desirable properties that (i) fit with test theory and is observable
(similar to a condition like conditional association), (ii) has the property
that a decision is stable (reliable), and (iii) satisfies Rousseau's criterion
that the input should match the decision. We use Fourier analysis of Boolean
functions to investigate whether a decision function is stable and to figure
out which (set of) items has proportionally too large an influence on the

accelerated miniaturization of electronics components on a spacecraft that is
reducing the mass, volume and cost of satellites. Yet, access to space remains
a distant dream as there is growing complexity in what is required of
satellites and increasing space traffic. Interplanetary exploration is even
harder and has limited possibilities for low cost mission. All of these factors
make even CubeSats, the entry-level standard too expensive for most and
therefore a better way needs to be found. The proposed solution in this report
is a low-mass, low-cost, disposable solution that exploits the latest advances
in electronics and is relatively easy to integrate: FemtoSats. FemtoSats are
sub-100-gram spacecraft. The FemtoSat concept is based on launching a swarm
where the main tasks are divided between the members of the swarm. This means
that if one fails the swarm can take its place and therefore substitute it
without risking the whole mission. In this paper we explore the utility of
FemtoSats to perform first exploration and mapping of a Lunar PSR. This concept
was recognized as finalist for the NASA BIG Competition in 2020. This is an
example of a high-risk, high-reward mission where losing one FemtoSat does not
mean the mission is in danger as it happens with regular satellite missions.

  Natural Language Processing (ICON 2020)",,,,cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Event Argument extraction refers to the task of extracting structured
information from unstructured text for a particular event of interest. The
existing works exhibit poor capabilities to extract causal event arguments like
Reason and After Effects. Furthermore, most of the existing works model this
task at a sentence level, restricting the context to a local scope. While it
may be effective for short spans of text, for longer bodies of text such as
news articles, it has often been observed that the arguments for an event do
not necessarily occur in the same sentence as that containing an event trigger.
To tackle the issue of argument scattering across sentences, the use of global
context becomes imperative in this task. In our work, we propose an external
knowledge aided approach to infuse document-level event information to aid the
extraction of complex event arguments. We develop a causal network for our
event-annotated dataset by extracting relevant event causal structures from
ConceptNet and phrases from Wikipedia. We use the extracted event causal
features in a bi-directional transformer encoder to effectively capture
long-range inter-sentence dependencies. We report the effectiveness of our
proposed approach through both qualitative and quantitative analysis. In this
task, we establish our findings on an event annotated dataset in 5 Indian
languages. This dataset adds further complexity to the task by labelling
arguments of entity type (like Time, Place) as well as more complex argument
types (like Reason, After-Effect). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance across all the five languages. Since our work does not rely on any
language-specific features, it can be easily extended to other languages.

further show that FACT, being somewhat more nuanced compared to FACE, can yield
findings of discrimination that differ from those obtained using FACE.

states, i.e. hard and soft states, in which the physical properties of the
accretion flow and of the jet are known to change. Recently, the JED-SAD
paradigm has been proposed for black hole X-ray binaries, aimed to address the
accretion-ejection interplay in these systems. According to this model, the
accretion flow is composed by an outer standard Shakura-Sunyaev disk (SAD) and
an inner hot Jet Emitting Disk (JED). The JED produces both the hard X-ray
emission, effectively playing the role of the hot corona, and the radio jets.
In this paper, we use the JED-SAD model to describe the evolution of the
accretion flow in the black hole transient MAXI J1820+070 during its hard and
hard-intermediate states. Contrarily to the previous applications of this
model, the Compton reflection component has been taken into account. We use
eight broadband X-rays spectra, including NuSTAR, NICER and Swift data,
providing a total spectral coverage of 0.8-190 keV. The data were directly
fitted with the JED-SAD model. Our results suggest that the optically thick
disk (i.e. the SAD) does not extend down to the ISCO in any of the considered
epochs. In particular, as the system evolves towards the hard/intermediate
state, we find that the inner radius decreases from $\sim$60 R$_{\rm G}$ in the
first observation down to $\sim$30 R$_{\rm G}$ in the last one. This trend is
accompanied by an increase of the mass-accretion rate. In all hard-intermediate
state observations, two reflection components, characterized by different
values of ionization, are required to adequately explain the data. These
components likely originate from different regions of the SAD. We show that a
flared outer disk could, in principle, explain the double reflection component.

galaxy evolution, saturating within $\sim0.01~$Gyr and thus potentially acting
as seeds for large-scale dynamos. However, unambiguous observational
confirmation of the fluctuation dynamo action in a galactic environment is
still missing. This is because, in spiral galaxies, it is difficult to
differentiate between small-scale magnetic fields generated by a fluctuation
dynamo and those due to the tangling of the large-scale field. We propose that
observations of magnetic fields in elliptical galaxies would directly probe the
fluctuation dynamo action. This is motivated by the fact that in ellipticals,
due to their lack of significant rotation, the conventional large-scale dynamo
is absent and the fluctuation dynamo is responsible for controlling the
magnetic field strength and structure. By considering turbulence injected by
Type Ia supernova explosions and possible magnetic field amplification by
cooling flows, we estimate expected magnetic field strengths of $0.2~-~1
\,\mu{\rm G}$ in quiescent elliptical galaxies. We use a semi-analytic model of
galaxy formation to estimate the distribution and redshift evolution of field
strengths, tentatively finding a decrease in magnetic field strength with
decreasing redshift. We analyse a sample of radio sources that exhibit the
Laing-Garrington (LG) effect (radio polarization asymmetry in jets) and infer
magnetic field strengths between $0.14~-~1.33 \,\mu{\rm G}$ for a uniform
thermal electron density and between $1.36~-~6.21\,\mu{\rm G}$ for the thermal
electron density following the King profile. We examine observational
techniques for measuring the magnetic field saturation state in elliptical
galaxies, focusing on Faraday RM grids, the LG effect, synchrotron emission,
and gravitational lensing, finding appealing prospects for future empirical
analysis.

taken at the Wise Observatory, over a period of about five months. We extracted
spectroscopic continuum and line light curves, and computed CCFs as well as
velocity-resolved CCFs with respect to the combined continuum V-band light
curve. The continuum luminosity of Mrk926 showed a drastic decrease during our
campaign: it dropped to less than 50% of its original value within only 2.5
months. The spectra show complex and very broad Balmer line profiles, including
outer Balmer satellites ranging from +-5000 to +-13,000 kms-1. The Ha, Hb, and
HeI5876 line light curves are delayed relative to the continuum light curve.
The Ha and Hb lines show two velocity-delay structures in the central part of
their line profile (within +- 5000 kms-1), at ~10 and ~57 ld and at ~5 and ~48
ld, respectively. These structures might be interpreted as the signature of a
line-emitting ring, inclined by ~50 deg to the line of sight and orbiting the
BH at radii, R, of 33.5 and 26.5 ld. We determined continuum luminosities,
log(lambda\,L_(lambda)/erg s-1), of 43.68 to 44.13, which are in good agreement

decreased from 8 to 3 percent during our campaign. The Balmer satellite
components show a response to the continuum variations on the order of only 3-5
days. We attribute this to the central line segment and the Balmer satellites

chosen target distance and angle. The requirement for this exact correspondence
between broadcast and received signals is that each moving point in the
polarization-current distribution approaches the target at the speed of light
at all times during its transit along the antenna. This results in a one-to-one
correspondence between the time at which each point on the moving polarization
current enters the antenna and the time at which {\it all} of the radiation
emitted by this particular point during its transit through the antenna arrives
simultaneously at the target. This has the effect of reproducing the desired
time dependence of the original broadcast signal. For other observer/detector
positions, the time dependence of the signal is scrambled, due to the
non-trivial relationship between emission (retarded) time and reception time.
This technique represents a contrast to conventional radio transmission
methods; in most examples of the latter, signals are broadcast with little or
no directivity, selectivity of reception being achieved through the use of
narrow frequency bands. In place of this, the current paper uses a spread of
frequencies to transmit information to a particular location; the signal is
weaker and has a scrambled time dependence elsewhere. We point out the possible
relevance of this mechanism to 5G neighbourhood networks. This work also
constitutes a ground-based astrophysics experiment that gives strong clues
towards the emission mechanism of pulsars.

both accelerometer and audio signals.
  The acceleration signals are captured by a smartphone firmly attached to the
patient's bed, using its integrated accelerometer.
  The audio signals are captured simultaneously by the same smartphone using an
external microphone.
  We have compiled a manually-annotated dataset containing such
simultaneously-captured acceleration and audio signals for approximately 6000
cough and 68000 non-cough events from 14 adult male patients in a tuberculosis
clinic.
  LR, SVM and MLP are evaluated as baseline classifiers and compared with deep
architectures such as CNN, LSTM, and Resnet50 using a leave-one-out
cross-validation scheme.
  We find that the studied classifiers can use either acceleration or audio
signals to distinguish between coughing and other activities including
sneezing, throat-clearing, and movement on the bed with high accuracy.
  However, in all cases, the deep neural networks outperform the shallow
classifiers by a clear margin and the Resnet50 offers the best performance by
achieving an AUC exceeding 0.98 and 0.99 for acceleration and audio signals
respectively.
  While audio-based classification consistently offers a better performance
than acceleration-based classification, we observe that the difference is very
small for the best systems.
  Since the acceleration signal requires less processing power, and since the
need to record audio is sidestepped and thus privacy is inherently secured, and
since the recording device is attached to the bed and not worn, an
accelerometer-based highly accurate non-invasive cough detector may represent a
more convenient and readily accepted method in long-term cough monitoring.

Rather, policies

Methodologically, computational modeling enables the application of a
combination of multiple influences on empirical data, thus allowing for
heterogeneous response to policies. We use a random forest machine learning
algorithm to emulate an agent-based model (ABM) and evaluate competing policies
across 46 Metropolitan Regions (MRs) in Brazil. In doing so, we use input
parameters and output indicators of 11,076 actual simulation runs and one
million emulated runs. As a result, we obtain the optimal (and non-optimal)
performance of each region over the policies. Optimum is defined as a
combination of production and inequality indicators for the full ensemble of
MRs. Results suggest that MRs already have embedded structures that favor
optimal or non-optimal results, but they also illustrate which policy is more
beneficial to each place. In addition to providing MR-specific policies'
results, the use of machine learning to simulate an ABM reduces the
computational burden, whereas allowing for a much larger variation among model
parameters. The coherence of results within the context of larger uncertainty
-- vis-\`a-vis those of the original ABM -- suggests an additional test of
robustness of the model. At the same time the exercise indicates which
parameters should policymakers intervene, in order to work towards optimum of
MRs.

dynamic environments, where the ability to respond to changing circumstances is
a crucial feature. An effective collective response requires suitable
information transfer among agents, and thus is critically dependent on the
agents' interaction network. In order to investigate the influence of the
network topology on collective response, we consider an archetypal model of
distributed decision-making---the leader-follower linear consensus---and study
the collective capacity of the system to follow a dynamic driving signal (the
""leader"") for a range of topologies and system sizes. The analysis reveals a
nontrivial relationship between optimal topology and frequency of the driving
signal. Interestingly, the response is optimal when each individual interacts
with a certain number of agents which decreases monotonically with the
frequency and, for large enough systems, is independent of the size of the
system. This phenomenology is investigated in experiments of collective motion
using a swarm of land robots. The emergent collective response to both a slow-
and a fast-changing leader is measured and analyzed for a range of interaction
topologies. These results have far-reaching practical implications for the
design and understanding of distributed systems, since they highlight that a
dynamic rewiring of the interaction network is paramount to the effective
collective operations of multi-agent systems at different time-scales.

specific compilation can facilitate largely interpretable feature
investigations and comparisons in terms of temporal dependence, temporal
variation, ""forecastability"", lumpiness, stability, nonlinearity (and
linearity), trends, spikiness, curvature and seasonality. Detailed
quantifications and multifaceted characterizations are herein obtained by
computing the values of the proposed feature compilation across nine temporal
resolutions (i.e., the 1-day, 2-day, 3-day, 7-day, 0.5-month, 1-month, 2-month,

differences between the examined time series types with respect to the

in these patterns are rather surprising. We also find that the spatial patterns
emerging from feature-based time series clustering are largely analogous across
temporal scales, and compare the features with respect to their usefulness in
clustering the time series at the various temporal resolutions. For most of the
features, this usefulness can vary to a notable degree across temporal
resolutions and time series types, thereby pointing out the need for conducting
multifaceted time series characterizations for the study of hydroclimatic

Lomb-Scargle periodograms, and searched for QPOs using wavelet scalograms. We
also attempted to classify the GRBs using the Hurst exponent, $H$, and the
$\mathcal{A}-\mathcal{T}$ plane. The PSDs fall into three categories: power law
(PL; $P(f)\propto 1/f^\beta$) with index $\beta\in(0,2)$, PL with a
non-negligible Poisson noise level (PLC) with $\beta\in(1,3)$, and a smoothly
broken PL (SBPL; with Poisson noise level) yielding high-frequency index
$\beta_2\in(2,6)$. The latter yields break time scales on the order of
1--100\,seconds. The PL and PLC models are broadly consistent with a fully
developed turbulence, $\beta=5/3$. For an overwhelming majority of GRBs (93\%),
$H>0.5$, implying ubiquity of the long-term memory. We find no convincing
substructure in the $\mathcal{A}-\mathcal{T}$ plane. Finally, we report on 34
new QPOs: with one or more constant leading periods, as well as several
chirping signals. The presence of breaks and QPOs suggests the existence of
characteristic time scales that in at least some GRBs might be related to the
dynamical properties of plasma trajectories in the accretion disks powering the
relativistic jets.

which shutters industries and displaces labor en masse. Regardless of the
impetus, people are faced with the challenge of moving between jobs to find new
work. Successful transitions typically occur when workers leverage their
existing skills in the new occupation. Here, we propose a novel method to
measure the similarity between occupations using their underlying skills. We
then build a recommender system for identifying optimal transition pathways
between occupations using job advertisements (ads) data and a longitudinal
household survey. Our results show that not only can we accurately predict
occupational transitions (Accuracy = 76%), but we account for the asymmetric
difficulties of moving between jobs (it is easier to move in one direction than
the other). We also build an early warning indicator for new technology
adoption (showcasing Artificial Intelligence), a major driver of rising job
transitions. By using real-time data, our systems can respond to labor demand
shifts as they occur (such as those caused by COVID-19). They can be leveraged

psychophysiological responses to TORs as a result of varying
non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs), traffic density and TOR lead time. A total
number of 102 drivers were recruited and each of them experienced 8 takeover
events in a high fidelity fixed-base driving simulator. Drivers' gaze
behaviors, heart rate (HR) activities, galvanic skin responses (GSRs), and
facial expressions were recorded and analyzed during two stages. First, during
the automated driving stage, we found that drivers had lower heart rate
variability, narrower horizontal gaze dispersion, and shorter eyes-on-road time
when they had a high level of cognitive load relative to a low level of
cognitive load. Second, during the takeover transition stage, 4s lead time led
to inhibited blink numbers and larger maximum and mean GSR phasic activation
compared to 7s lead time, whilst heavy traffic density resulted in increased HR
acceleration patterns than light traffic density. Our results showed that
psychophysiological measures can indicate specific internal states of drivers,
including their workload, emotions, attention, and situation awareness in a

experimentally and theoretically, the interaction mechanisms between acoustic
vibrations (phonons) and localized surface plasmons (LSPs) remain quite
unexplored. Here we present a theoretical investigation of the interactions
between confined acoustic vibrations and LSPs involved in resonant acoustic
phonon Raman scattering. We express the Raman scattering process in the
framework of the Fermi's golden rule and introduce for the first time the
concept of Raman energy density (RED). Similarly to the Raman-Brillouin
electronic density (RBED) introduced for semiconductors, this new physical
quantity is used as a theoretical tool for the interpretation of resonant Raman
scattering mediated by LSPs in metallic nanoparticles. The RED represents the
electromagnetic energy density excited by the Raman probe and modulated by the
acoustic vibrations of the nanoparticle. We show that, similarly to the local
density of optical states (LDOS) and the RBED, the RED can be mapped in the
near-field region, which provides a clear picture of the interaction between
LSPs and acoustic vibrations giving rise to inelastic scattering measurable in
the far-field. Here, we use the newly introduced RED concept to investigate

The plasma also gives enough energy to break the Van der Waals bonds between
the graphene layers but not enough to break the covalent C-C bonds within the

graphene sheets, and showed that they were monocrystalline. No contamination
was found in the obtained nanomaterial. An unknown phenomenon has been found in

from the very large number of collisions inside the ATLAS detector at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC). The Fast TracKer (FTK) is a hardware based track finder,
built to greatly improve the ATLAS trigger system capabilities for identifying
interesting physics processes through track-based signatures. The FTK is
reconstructing after each Level-1 trigger all tracks with $ p_{\textrm T}>1 $
GeV, such that the high-level trigger system gains access to track information
at an early stage. FTK track reconstruction starts with a pattern recognition
step. Patterns are found with hits in seven out of eight possible detector
layers.
  Disabled detector modules, as often encountered during LHC operation, lead to
efficiency losses. To recover efficiency, WildCards (WC) algorithms are
implemented in the FTK system. The WC algorithm recovers inefficiency but also
causes high combinatorial background and thus increased data volumes in the FTK
system, possibly exceeding hardware limitations. To overcome this, a refined
algorithm to select patterns is developed and investigated in this article.

networks, one anomalous physical node (PN) or physical link (PL) in substrate
networks that carries multiple virtual network elements can cause significant
performance degradation of multiple network slices. To recover the substrate
networks from anomaly within a short time, rapid and accurate identification of
whether or not the anomaly exists in PNs and PLs is vital. Online anomaly
detection methods that can analyze system data in real-time are preferred.
Besides, as virtual nodes and links mapped to PNs and PLs are scattered in
multiple slices, the distributed detection modes are required to adapt to the
virtualized environment. According to those requirements, in this paper, we
first propose a distributed online PN anomaly detection algorithm based on a
decentralized one-class support vector machine (OCSVM), which is realized
through analyzing real-time measurements of virtual nodes mapped to PNs in a
distributed manner. Specifically, to decouple the OCSVM objective function, we
transform the original problem to a group of decentralized quadratic
programming problems by introducing the consensus constraints. The alternating
direction method of multipliers is adopted to achieve the solution for the
distributed online PN anomaly detection. Next, by utilizing the correlation of
measurements between neighbor virtual nodes, another distributed online PL
anomaly detection algorithm based on the canonical correlation analysis is
proposed. The network only needs to store covariance matrices and mean vectors
of current data to calculate the canonical correlation vectors for real-time PL
anomaly analysis. The simulation results on both synthetic and real-world
network datasets show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed
distributed online anomaly detection algorithms.

this paper, we study functional factor models for time-dependent functional

Specifically, we use the information contained on the covariances at different

allows murmuring starlings to outmaneuver preying falcons$^2$, shoaling
sardines to outsmart sea lions$^3$, and homo sapiens to outlive their
Pleistocene peers$^4$. On the micron-scale, bacterial colonies show excellent
resilience thanks to the individuals' ability to cooperate even when densely
packed, mitigating their internal flow pattern to mix nutrients, fence the
immune system, and resist antibiotics$^{5-14}$. Production of an artificial
swarm on the micro-scale faces a serious challenge $\frac{\;\;}{\;\;}$ while an
individual bacterium has an evolutionary-forged internal machinery to produce
propulsion, until now, artificial micro-swimmers relied on the precise chemical
composition of their environment to directly fuel their drive$^{14-23}$. When
crowded, artificial micro-swimmers compete locally for a finite fuel supply,
quenching each other's activity at their greatest propensity for cooperation.
Here we introduce an artificial micro-swimmer that consumes no chemical fuel
and is driven solely by light. We couple a light absorbing particle to a fluid
droplet, forming a colloidal chimera that transforms light energy into
propulsive thermo-capillary action. The swimmers' internal drive allows them to
operate and remain active for a long duration (days) and their effective
repulsive interaction allows for a high density fluid phase. We find that above
a critical concentration, swimmers form a long lived crowded state that
displays internal dynamics. When passive particles are introduced, the dense
swimmer phase can re-arrange and spontaneously corral the passive particles. We
derive a geometrical, depletion-like condition for corralling by identifying
the role the passive particles play in controlling the effective concentration
of the micro-swimmers.

variation at the expense of others - in this case we refer to the features as
``imbalanced''. Feature imbalance leads to poor generalization when the latent
variables are used in an environment where the presence of features changes.
Similarly, latent variables trained with imbalanced features induce the VAE to
generate less diverse (i.e. biased towards dominant features) samples. To
address this, we propose a regularization scheme for VAEs, which we show
substantially addresses the feature imbalance problem. We also introduce a
simple metric to measure the balance of features in generated images.

transport through low-permeability fractured media in the subsurface by
explicitly representing fractures as discrete entities. The governing equations
for flow and transport are numerically integrated on computational meshes
generated on the interconnected fracture networks. Modern high-fidelity DFN
simulations require high-performance computing on multiple processors where
performance and scalability depend partially on obtaining a high-quality
partition of the mesh to balance work-loads and minimize communication across
all processors. The discrete structure of a DFN naturally lends itself to
various graph representations. We develop two applications of the multilevel
graph partitioning algorithm to partition the mesh of a DFN. In the first, we
project a partition of the graph based on the DFN topology onto the mesh of the
DFN and in the second, this projection is used as the initial condition for
further partitioning refinement of the mesh. We compare the performance of
these methods with standard multi-level graph partitioning using graph-based
metrics (cut, imbalance, partitioning time), computational-based metrics
(FLOPS, iterations, solver time), and total run time. The DFN-based and the
mesh-based partitioning methods are comparable in terms of the graph-based
metrics, but the time required to obtain the partition is several orders of
magnitude faster using the DFN-based partitions. In combination, these
partitions are several orders of magnitude faster than the mesh-based
partition. In turn, this hybrid method outperformed both of the other methods

The privacy utility trade-off was facilitated through a privacy funnel based on
mutual information. Nevertheless, it is challenging to characterize the mutual
information accurately with small sample size or unknown distribution
functions. In this article, we propose a privacy funnel based on mutual
information neural estimator (MINE) to optimize the privacy utility trade-off
by estimating mutual information. Instead of computing mutual information in
traditional way, we estimate it using an MINE, which obtains the estimated
mutual information in a trained way, ensuring that the estimation results are
as precise as possible. We employ estimated mutual information as a measure of
privacy and utility, and then form a problem to optimize data utility by
training a neural network while the estimator's privacy discourse is less than
a threshold. The simulation results also demonstrated that the estimated mutual

even with a limited number of samples to quantify privacy leakage and data
utility retention, as well as optimize the privacy utility trade-off.

a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal abundance model that integrates
indirect county-level data on opioid-related outcomes with state-level survey

that our integrated model accurately recovers the latent counts and prevalence.
We apply our model to county-level surveillance data on opioid overdose deaths

utterance, the objects,relations, and actions that the utterance refers to, the
objectives for future robotic actions it implies, and generates a plan to
execute those actions while updating a state representation to include newly
acquired knowledge from the visual-linguistic context. Grounding a command
necessitates a representation for past observations and interactions; however,
maintaining the full context consisting of all possible observed objects,

Instead, our model, Temporal Grounding Graphs, maintains a learned state

significantly expands the range of language that a robot can understand by

and $T_2(V_2, E_2)$ defines a one-to-one mapping between nodes in $T_1$ and
$T_2$ that preserves ancestor relationship. For unordered trees the problem of
finding a maximum-weight Tai mapping is known to be NP-complete. In this work,
we define an anti Tai mapping $M\subseteq V_1\times V_2$ as a binary relation
between two unordered labeled trees such that any two $(x,y), (x', y')\in M$
violate ancestor relationship and thus cannot be part of the same Tai mapping,
i.e. $(x\le x' \iff y\not \le y') \vee (x'\le x \iff y'\not \le y)$, given an
ancestor order $x<x'$ meaning that $x$ is an ancestor of $x'$. Finding a
maximum-weight anti Tai mapping arises in the cutting plane method for solving
the maximum-weight Tai mapping problem via integer programming. We give an
efficient polynomial-time algorithm for finding a maximum-weight anti Tai
mapping for the case when one of the two trees is a path and further show how
to extend this result in order to provide a polynomially computable lower bound
on the optimal anti Tai mapping for two unordered labeled trees. The latter
result stems from the special class of anti Tai mapping defined by the more
restricted condition $x\sim x' \iff y\not\sim y'$, where $\sim$ denotes that
two nodes belong to the same root-to-leaf path. For this class, we give an
efficient algorithm that solves the problem directly on two unordered trees in

dimensions, energy from gravitational waves can leak into these extra spacetime
dimensions, leading to a reduction in the amplitude of the observed

luminosity distances to gravitational wave sources. Since binary black hole
(BBH) mergers are standard sirens, we use the pair-instability supernova
(PISNe) mass gap and its predicted features to determine a mass scale and thus
be able to break the mass-redshift degeneracy. We simultaneously fit for the
BBH population and the extra spacetime dimensions parameters from gravitational
leakage models using BBH observations from the recently released GWTC-3
catalog. We set constraints on the number of spacetime dimensions and find that
$D= 3.95^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$ at $68\%$ C.L. for models that are independent of a
screening scale, finding that the GWTC-3 constraint is as competitive as that
set from GW170817 and its electromagnetic counterpart. For models where gravity
leaks below a certain screening scale $R_c$, we find $D=4.23^{+1.50}_{-0.57}$

$\log_{10} n = 0.86^{+0.73}_{-0.84}$ for the leakage, which for the first are
constrained jointly with the BBH population at cosmological distances. These
constraints are consistent with General Relativity (GR) where gravitational
waves propagate in $D=3+1$ spacetime dimensions. Using the BBH population to
probe modifications to standard cosmological models provides an independent
test of GR that does not rely on any electromagnetic information but purely on

compositional representations of objects and scenes. In contrast to the classic

systems. Current graph embedding approaches either sample a large number of
node pairs from a graph to learn node embeddings via stochastic optimization or
factorize a high-order proximity/adjacency matrix of the graph via
computationally expensive matrix factorization techniques. These approaches
typically require significant resources for the learning process and rely on
multiple parameters, which limits their applicability in practice. Moreover,
most of the existing graph embedding techniques operate effectively in one
specific metric space only (e.g., the one produced with cosine similarity), do
not preserve higher-order structural features of the input graph and cannot
automatically determine a meaningful number of embedding dimensions. Typically,
the produced embeddings are not easily interpretable, which complicates further
analyses and limits their applicability. To address these issues, we propose
DAOR, a highly efficient and parameter-free graph embedding technique producing
metric space-robust, compact and interpretable embeddings without any manual

yields competitive results on both node classification (which benefits form
high-order proximity) and link prediction (which relies on low-order proximity
mostly). Unlike existing techniques, however, DAOR does not require any

an acoustic model. Regardless of the language model's complexity and variants,
three critical pre-processing steps are needed in language models: cleaning,
normalization, and tokenization. Among mentioned steps, the normalization step
is so essential to format unification in pure textual applications. However,
for embedded language models in speech processing modules, normalization is not
limited to format unification. Moreover, it has to convert each readable
symbol, number, etc., to how they are pronounced. To the best of our knowledge,
there is no Persian normalization toolkits for embedded language models in
speech processing modules, So in this paper, we propose an open-source
normalization toolkit for text processing in speech applications. Briefly, we
consider different readable Persian text like symbols (common currencies, #, @,
URL, etc.), numbers (date, time, phone number, national code, etc.), and so on.
Comparison with other available Persian textual normalization tools indicates
the superiority of the proposed method in speech processing. Also, comparing
the model's performance for one of the proposed functions (sentence separation)
with other common natural language libraries such as HAZM and Parsivar
indicates the proper performance of the proposed method. Besides, its
evaluation of some Persian Wikipedia data confirms the proper performance of
the proposed method.

  Satellite Systems",,,,,cs.CR,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  This paper presents a blockchain-based approach for securing spectrum sharing
in multi-beam satellite systems. Satellite spectrum is a scarce resource that
requires highly efficient management schemes for optimized sharing by network
users. However, spectrum sharing is vulnerable to attacks by malicious protocol
participants. In order to ensure efficient spectrum management in the face of
dishonest satellite users or cyber attackers, it is important for spectrum
sharing mechanism to provide transparency and traceability of the trading
process so as to enable the system to detect, and hence eliminate, unauthorized
access by malicious users. We address these requirements by proposing the use
of blockchain which, apart from its ability to provide transparency and
traceability, ensures an immutable means for keeping track of user trading
reputation. Besides, in order to address the practical constraints of
heterogeneous user nodes, we also propose the use of edge computing to support
users with limited computing power. In this paper, we propose a
blockchain-based spectrum trading framework and, based on which, a multibeam
satellite spectrum sharing algorithm for interference pricing and heterogeneous
spectrum demands is devised to improve the efficiency of satellite spectrum. By
leveraging on the system characteristics of blockchain, a dynamic spectrum
sharing mechanism with traceability, openness and transparency for whole
trading process is presented. Numerical results are also provided to evaluate
the system benefits and spectrum pricing of the proposed mechanism.

two-dimensional implementation of the combined finite-discrete element method
(FDEM), which merges the finite element method (FEM) and the discrete element
method (DEM), is used to explicitly to simulate a sheared granular fault
system. We focus on investigating the influence of normal load, driving shear
velocity and plate stiffness on the velocities and displacements measured at
locations on the upper and lower plates just adjacent to the gouge in the
direction parallel to the shear direction (x direction). The simulations show
that at slips the plate velocities are proportional to the normal load and may
be inversely proportional to the square root of the plate's Young's modulus;
whereas the driving shear velocity does not show distinct influence on the
plate velocities. During stick phases, the velocities of the upper and lower
plates are respectively slightly greater and slightly smaller than the half of
the driving shear velocity, and are both in the same direction of shear. The
shear strain rate of the gouge is calculated from this velocity difference
between the upper and lower plate during stick phases and thus the gouge
effective shear modulus can be calculated. The results show that the gouge
effective shear modulus increases proportionally with normal load, while the
influence of shear velocity and plate stiffness on gouge effective shear
modulus is minor. The simulations address the dynamics of a laboratory scale
fault gouge system and may help reveal the complexities of earthquake
frictional dynamics.

  Network",,,,,cs.SD eess.AS,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The echo state network (ESN) is a powerful and efficient tool for displaying
dynamic data. However, many existing ESNs have limitations for properly
modeling high-dimensional data. The most important limitation of these networks
is the high memory consumption due to their reservoir structure, which has
prevented the increase of reservoir units and the maximum use of special
capabilities of this type of network. One way to solve this problem is to use
quaternion algebra. Because quaternions have four different dimensions,
high-dimensional data are easily represented and, using Hamilton
multiplication, with fewer parameters than real numbers, make external
relations between the multidimensional features easier. In addition to the
memory problem in the ESN network, the linear output of the ESN network poses
an indescribable limit to its processing capacity, as it cannot effectively
utilize higher-order statistics of features provided by the nonlinear dynamics
of reservoir neurons. In this research, a new structure based on ESN is
presented, in which quaternion algebra is used to compress the network data
with the simple split function, and the output linear combiner is replaced by a
multidimensional bilinear filter. This filter will be used for nonlinear
calculations of the output layer of the ESN. In addition, the two-dimensional
principal component analysis technique is used to reduce the number of data
transferred to the bilinear filter. In this study, the coefficients and the
weights of the quaternion nonlinear ESN (QNESN) are optimized using the genetic
algorithm. In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed model compared
to the previous methods, experiments for speech emotion recognition have been
performed on EMODB, SAVEE, and IEMOCAP speech emotional datasets. Comparisons
show that the proposed QNESN network performs better than the ESN and most
currently SER systems.

the graph that connects a given set of vertices. It is a classic NP-hard
combinatorial optimization problem and has many real-world applications (e.g.,
VLSI chip design, transportation network planning and wireless sensor
networks). Many exact and approximate algorithms have been developed for STP,
but they suffer from high computational complexity and weak worst-case solution
guarantees, respectively. Heuristic algorithms are also developed. However,
each of them requires application domain knowledge to design and is only
suitable for specific scenarios. Motivated by the recently reported observation
that instances of the same NP-hard combinatorial problem may maintain the same
or similar combinatorial structure but mainly differ in their data, we
investigate the feasibility and benefits of applying machine learning
techniques to solving STP. To this end, we design a novel model Vulcan based on
novel graph neural networks and deep reinforcement learning. The core of Vulcan
is a novel, compact graph embedding that transforms highdimensional graph
structure data (i.e., path-changed information) into a low-dimensional vector
representation. Given an STP instance, Vulcan uses this embedding to encode its
pathrelated information and sends the encoded graph to a deep reinforcement
learning component based on a double deep Q network (DDQN) to find solutions.
In addition to STP, Vulcan can also find solutions to a wide range of NP-hard
problems (e.g., SAT, MVC and X3C) by reducing them to STP. We implement a
prototype of Vulcan and demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency with extensive
experiments using real-world and synthetic datasets.

data-driven method to categorise predictions by uncertainty with estimated
error bounds. This framework can be applied to any continuous uncertainty
measure, allowing straightforward identification of the best subset of
predictions with accompanying estimated error bounds. We facilitate easy
comparison between uncertainty measures by constructing two evaluation metrics
derived from Quantile Binning. We demonstrate this framework by comparing and
contrasting three uncertainty measures (a baseline, the current gold standard,
and a proposed method combining aspects of the two), across two datasets (one
easy, one hard) and two heatmap-based landmark localization model paradigms
(U-Net and patch-based). We conclude by illustrating how filtering out gross

proportion of predictions under an acceptable error threshold, and offer
recommendations on which uncertainty measure to use and how to use it.

wide-field, high cadence optical time-domain surveys, raises the possibility of
the first joint GW-electromagnetic (EM) detections of core-collapse supernovae
(CCSNe). For targeted searches of GWs from CCSNe optical observations can be
used to increase the sensitivity of the search by restricting the relevant time
interval, defined here as the GW search window (GSW). The extent of the GSW is
a critical factor in determining the achievable false alarm probability (FAP)
for a triggered CCSN search. The ability to constrain the GSW from optical
observations depends on how early a CCSN is detected, as well as the ability to
model the early optical emission. Here we present several approaches to
constrain the GSW, ranging in complexity from model-independent analytical fits
of the early light curve, model-dependent fits of the rising or entire light
curve, and a new data-driven approach using existing well-sampled CCSN light
curves from {\it Kepler} and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).
We use these approaches to determine the time of core-collapse and its
associated uncertainty (i.e., the GSW). We apply our methods to two Type II SNe
that occurred during LIGO/Virgo Observing Run 3: SN\,2019fcn and SN\,2019ejj

engine interaction, which in the literature are known as click models, come in
the form of Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Although many authors have used the
resemblance between the different click models to derive estimation procedures
for these models, in particular in the form of expectation maximization (EM),
still this commonly requires considerable work, in particular when it comes to
deriving the E-step. What we propose in this paper, is that this derivation is
commonly unnecessary: many existing click models can in fact, under certain
assumptions, be optimized as they were Input-Output Hidden Markov Models
(IO-HMMs), for which the forward-backward equations immediately provide this
E-step. To arrive at that conclusion, we will present the Generalized Cascade
Model (GCM) and show how this model can be estimated using the IO-HMM EM
framework, and provide two examples of how existing click models can be mapped
to GCM. Our GCM approach to estimating click models has also been implemented
in the gecasmo Python package.

  Compromise","CCS paper with significant improvement of the proofs, first step
  towards a journal version",,,,cs.CR cs.PL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We propose a new formal criterion for evaluating secure compilation schemes
for unsafe languages, expressing end-to-end security guarantees for software
components that may become compromised after encountering undefined
behavior---for example, by accessing an array out of bounds.
  Our criterion is the first to model dynamic compromise in a system of
mutually distrustful components with clearly specified privileges. It
articulates how each component should be protected from all the others---in
particular, from components that have encountered undefined behavior and become
compromised. Each component receives secure compilation guarantees---in
particular, its internal invariants are protected from compromised
components---up to the point when this component itself becomes compromised,
after which we assume an attacker can take complete control and use this
component's privileges to attack other components. More precisely, a secure
compilation chain must ensure that a dynamically compromised component cannot
break the safety properties of the system at the target level any more than an
arbitrary attacker-controlled component (with the same interface and
privileges, but without undefined behaviors) already could at the source level.
  To illustrate the model, we construct a secure compilation chain for a small
unsafe language with buffers, procedures, and components, targeting a simple
abstract machine with built-in compartmentalization. We give a machine-checked
proof in Coq that this compiler satisfies our secure compilation criterion.
Finally, we show that the protection guarantees offered by the
compartmentalized abstract machine can be achieved at the machine-code level
using either software fault isolation or a tag-based reference monitor.

generation has attracted increasing attention recently. Generally, dominant
models are Seq2Tree models, which convert the input natural language
description into a sequence of tree-construction actions corresponding to the
pre-order traversal of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). However, such a traversal
order may not be suitable for handling all multi-branch nodes. In this paper,
we propose to equip the Seq2Tree model with a context-based Branch Selector,
which is able to dynamically determine optimal expansion orders of branches for
multi-branch nodes. Particularly, since the selection of expansion orders is a
non-differentiable multi-step operation, we optimize the selector through
reinforcement learning, and formulate the reward function as the difference of
model losses obtained through different expansion orders. Experimental results
and in-depth analysis on several commonly-used datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and generality of our approach. We have released our code at

are extensively studied in various computational settings. Typically, computing

  Furthermore, we study \emph{bi-chromatic} variants of these parameters

focuses only on distances for pairs of vertices that are colored differently.
Motivated by applications in computational geometry, bi-chromatic diameter,
radius and eccentricities have been recently studied in the sequential setting

(P9) -- has been inferred from the clustering of longitude of perihelion and
pole position of distant eccentric Kuiper belt objects (KBOs). After updating
calculations of observational biases, we find that the clustering remains
significant at the 99.6\% confidence level. We thus use these observations to
determine orbital elements of P9. A suite of numerical simulations shows that
the orbital distribution of the distant KBOs is strongly influenced by the mass
and orbital elements of P9 and thus can be used to infer these parameters.
Combining the biases with these numerical simulations, we calculate likelihood
values for discrete set of P9 parameters, which we then use as input into a
Gaussian Process emulator that allows a likelihood computation for arbitrary
values of all parameters. We use this emulator in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
analysis to estimate parameters of P9. We find a P9 mass of $6.2^{+2.2}_{-1.3}$
Earth masses, semimajor axis of $380^{+140}_{-80}$ AU, inclination of
$16\pm5^\circ$ and perihelion of $300^{+85}_{-60}$ AU. Using samples of the
orbital elements and estimates of the radius and albedo of such a planet, we
calculate the probability distribution function of the on-sky position of
Planet Nine and of its brightness. For many reasonable assumptions, Planet Nine
is closer and brighter than initially expected, though the probability
distribution includes a long tail to larger distances, and uncertainties in the
radius and albedo of Planet Nine could yield fainter objects.

portability and accuracy in laser power measurement above 100 W. Reflection and
absorption of laser light provide a measurable force from photon momentum
exchange that is directly proportional to laser power, which can be measured
with an electrostatic balance traceable to the SI. We aim for a relative
uncertainty of $10^{-3}$ with coverage factor $k=2$. For this purpose, we have
designed a monolithic parallelogram 4-bar linkage incorporating elastic
circular notch flexure hinges. The design is optimized to address the main
factors driving force measurement uncertainty from the balance mechanism:
corner loading errors, balance stiffness, stress in the flexure hinges,
sensitivity to vibration, and sensitivity to thermal gradients. Parasitic
rotations in the free end of the 4-bar linkage during arcuate motion are
constrained by machining tolerances. An analytical model shows this affects the
force measurement less than 0.01 percent. Incorporating an inverted pendulum
reduces the stiffness of the system without unduly increasing tilt sensitivity.
Finite element modeling of the flexures is used to determine the hinge
orientation that minimizes stress which is therefore expected to minimize
hysteresis. Thermal effects are mitigated using an external enclosure to
minimize temperature gradients, although a quantitative analysis of this effect
is not carried out. These analyses show the optimized mechanism is expected to
contribute less than $10^{-3}$ relative uncertainty in the final laser power
measurement.

artistic styles; d) are sparse and noisy. We thus, use an off-the-shelf
unsupervised image to image translation method to translate the comics images
to natural ones and then use an attention-guided monocular depth estimator to
predict their depth. This lets us leverage the depth annotations of existing
natural images to train the depth estimator. Furthermore, our model learns to
distinguish between text and images in the comics panels to reduce text-based
artefacts in the depth estimates. Our method consistently outperforms the
existing state-ofthe-art approaches across all metrics on both the DCM and
eBDtheque images. Finally, we introduce a dataset to evaluate depth prediction
on comics.

method that has been widely used in data analysis and modeling. It is an
unsupervised learning technique that identifies a suitable linear subspace for
the input variable that contains maximal variation and preserves as much
information as possible. PCA has also been used in prediction models where the
original, high-dimensional space of predictors is reduced to a smaller, more
manageable, set before conducting regression analysis. However, this approach
does not incorporate information in the response during the dimension-reduction
stage and hence can have poor predictive performance. To address this concern,
several supervised linear dimension-reduction techniques have been proposed in
the literature. This paper reviews selected techniques, extends some of them,
and compares their performance through simulations. Two of these techniques,
partial least squares (PLS) and least-squares PCA (LSPCA), consistently
outperform the others in this study.

functional scene representation, at hundreds of samples along a ray cast
through the volume, they are fundamentally limited to small scenes with the

clouds to neural implicit light fields allows us to represent large scenes
effectively with only a single implicit sampling operation per ray. These point
light fields are as a function of the ray direction, and local point feature
neighborhood, allowing us to interpolate the light field conditioned training
images without dense object coverage and parallax. We assess the proposed

The HST observations show signs of water absorption indicative of a
non-inverted thermal structure. We fit the data with both a one-dimensional
free retrieval and a grid of one-dimensional self-consistent forward models to
confirm this non-inverted structure. The free retrieval places a $3\sigma$
lower limit on the atmospheric water abundance of $\log(n_\mathrm{H_2O})>-4.78$
and can not constrain the CO abundance. The grid fit produces a slightly
super-stellar metallicity and constrains the carbon-to-oxygen ratio to less
than or equal to the solar value. We also compare our data to recent
high-resolution observations of WASP-77Ab taken with the Gemini-South/IGRINS
spectrograph and find that our observations are consistent with the best-fit
model to the high-resolution data. However, the metallicity derived from the
IGRINS data is significantly lower than that derived from our self-consistent

is not limited to any particular class of potentials and is valid for both

singularities can exist in these models for a limited set of initial

learning (MAL), however, its effects are far from understood. To make progress
in this direction, we study a smooth analogue of Q-learning. We start by
showing that our learning model has strong theoretical justification as an
optimal model for studying exploration-exploitation. Specifically, we prove
that smooth Q-learning has bounded regret in arbitrary games for a cost model
that explicitly captures the balance between game and exploration costs and
that it always converges to the set of quantal-response equilibria (QRE), the
standard solution concept for games under bounded rationality, in weighted
potential games with heterogeneous learning agents. In our main task, we then
turn to measure the effect of exploration in collective system performance. We
characterize the geometry of the QRE surface in low-dimensional MAL systems and
link our findings with catastrophe (bifurcation) theory. In particular, as the
exploration hyperparameter evolves over-time, the system undergoes phase
transitions where the number and stability of equilibria can change radically
given an infinitesimal change to the exploration parameter. Based on this, we
provide a formal theoretical treatment of how tuning the exploration parameter
can provably lead to equilibrium selection with both positive as well as
negative (and potentially unbounded) effects to system performance.

  mode instability in the presence of a strong guide field",,,,,physics.plasm-ph,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We derive and analyze a dispersion relation for the growth rate of
collisionless tearing modes, driven by electron inertia and accounting for
equilibrium electron temperature anisotropy in a strong guide field regime. For
this purpose, a new gyrofluid model is derived and subsequently simplified to
make the derivation of the dispersion relation treatable analytically. The main
simplifying assumptions consist in assuming cold ions, neglecting electron
finite Larmor radius effects, decoupling ion gyrocenter fluctuations and
considering $\beta_{\perp_e} \ll 1$, with $\beta_{\perp_e}$ indicating the
ratio between the perpendicular electron thermal pressure and the magnetic
pressure exerted by the guide field. This simplified version of the gyrofluid
model is shown to possess a noncanonical Hamiltonian structure. The dispersion
relation is obtained by applying the theory of asymptotic matching and does not
predict an enhancement of the growth rate as the ratio $\Theta_e$, between
perpendicular and parallel equilibrium electron temperatures, increases. This
indicates a significant difference with respect to the case of absent or
moderate guide field. For an equilibrium magnetic shear length of the order of
the perpendicular sonic Larmor radius and at a fixed $\beta_{\perp_e}$, we
obtain that the tearing mode in the strong guide field regime gets actually
weakly damped, as $\Theta_e$ increases. In the isotropic limit $\Theta_e=1$,
the dispersion relation reduces to a previously known formula. The analytical
predictions are tested against numerical simulations showing a very good
quantitative agreement. We also provide a detailed discussion of the range of
validity of the derived dispersion relation and of the compatibility among the
different adopted assumptions.

its unique characteristics, including the local spatial information and
low-rankness. SP-DLRR is mainly composed of two modules, i.e., the
classification-guided superpixel segmentation and the discriminative low-rank
representation, which are iteratively conducted. Specifically, by utilizing the
local spatial information and incorporating the predictions from a typical
classifier, the first module segments pixels of an input HSI (or its
restoration generated by the second module) into superpixels. According to the
resulting superpixels, the pixels of the input HSI are then grouped into
clusters and fed into our novel discriminative low-rank representation model
with an effective numerical solution. Such a model is capable of increasing the
intra-class similarity by suppressing the spectral variations locally while
promoting the inter-class discriminability globally, leading to a restored HSI
with more discriminative pixels. Experimental results on three benchmark

undermining the wide-deployment of face recognition systems. Though
presentation attack detection (PAD) systems try to address this problem, the
lack of generalization and robustness continues to be a major concern. Several
works have shown that using multi-channel PAD systems could alleviate this
vulnerability and result in more robust systems. However, there is a wide
selection of channels available for a PAD system such as RGB, Near Infrared,
Shortwave Infrared, Depth, and Thermal sensors. Having a lot of sensors
increases the cost of the system, and therefore an understanding of the
performance of different sensors against a wide variety of attacks is necessary
while selecting the modalities. In this work, we perform a comprehensive study
to understand the effectiveness of various imaging modalities for PAD. The
studies are performed on a multi-channel PAD dataset, collected with 14
different sensing modalities considering a wide range of 2D, 3D, and partial
attacks. We used the multi-channel convolutional network-based architecture,
which uses pixel-wise binary supervision. The model has been evaluated with
different combinations of channels, and different image qualities on a variety

interesting trends and can act as pointers for sensor selection for

trained with accessible labeled data in the source domain (SD) and few labeled
data in the target domain (TD). However, data usually contain private

Thus, the private information will be leaked if we directly access data in SD
to train a target-domain classifier (required by FDA methods). In this paper,
to thoroughly prevent the privacy leakage in SD, we consider a very challenging
problem setting, where the classifier for the TD has to be trained using few
labeled target data and a well-trained SD classifier, named few-shot hypothesis
adaptation (FHA). In FHA, we cannot access data in SD, as a result, the private

enhance the network capability to improve the quality of experience (QoE) at

features offered by 5G networks, has lately received much interest. However,
more research is still needed to convey large-sized multimedia content
including video, audio and pictures to the high speed moving vehicles. In this
paper, we study the gains achieved by proactive caching in Roadside Units
(RSUs) where we take into consideration the effect of the vehicle velocity on
the optimal caching decision. Information about the user demand and mobility is
harnessed to cache some files in RSUs, which will communicate with vehicles
traversing along the visited roads before the actual demand. Our main objective
is to minimize the total network latency. Towards this objective, we formulate
two optimization problems for non-cooperative and cooperative caching schemes
to find the optimal caching policy to decide which files to be cached by the
RSUs. Due to the complexity of these problems, we propose a sub-optimal caching
policy for each scheme. We compare the performance of the optimal caching
policy to that of the sub-optimal caching policy. Numerical results show that
proactive caching has a significant performance gain when compared to the
baseline reactive scenario. Moreover, results reveal that the cooperative
caching scheme is more efficient than the non-cooperative scheme.

polygon $P$ that can be placed into a simple polygon $Q$. Despite significant
effort, known algorithms require high polynomial running times. (Barequet and
Har-Peled, 2001) give a lower bound of $n^{2-o(1)}$ under the 3SUM conjecture
when $P$ and $Q$ are (convex) polygons with $\Theta(n)$ vertices each. This
leaves open whether we can establish (1) hardness beyond quadratic time and (2)
any superlinear bound for constant-sized $P$ or $Q$.
  In this paper, we affirmatively answer these questions under the $k$SUM
conjecture, proving natural hardness results that increase with each degree of
freedom (scaling, $x$-translation, $y$-translation, rotation): (1) Finding the
largest copy of $P$ that can be $x$-translated into $Q$ requires time
$n^{2-o(1)}$ under the 3SUM conjecture. (2) Finding the largest copy of $P$
that can be arbitrarily translated into $Q$ requires time $n^{2-o(1)}$ under
the 4SUM conjecture. (3) The above lower bounds are almost tight when one of
the polygons is of constant size: we obtain an $\tilde O((pq)^{2.5})$-time
algorithm for orthogonal polygons $P,Q$ with $p$ and $q$ vertices,
respectively. (4) Finding the largest copy of $P$ that can be arbitrarily

beginning to attract interest across a range of applications, including smart
homes, smart transportation, smart health, and industrial contexts. This
cutting-edge technology enables individuals to track and control their
integrated environment in real-time and remotely via a thousand IoT devices
comprised of sensors and actuators that actively participate in sensing,
processing, storing, and sharing information. Nonetheless, IoT devices are
frequently deployed in hostile environments, wherein adversaries attempt to
capture and breach them in order to seize control of the entire network. One
such example of potentially malicious behaviour is the cloning of IoT devices,
in which an attacker can physically capture the devices, obtain some sensitive
information, duplicate the devices, and intelligently deploy them in desired
locations to conduct various insider attacks. A device cloning attack on IoT
networks is a significant security concern since it allows for selective
forwarding, sink-hole, and black-hole attacks. To address this issue, this
paper provides an efficient scheme for detecting clone node attacks on IoT
networks that makes use of semantic information about IoT devices known as
context information sensed from the deployed environment to locate them
securely. We design a location proof mechanism by combining location proofs and
batch verification of the extended elliptic curve digital signature technique
to accelerate the verification process at selected trusted nodes. We
demonstrate the security of our scheme and its resilience to secure clone node
attack detection by conducting a comprehensive security analysis. The
performance of our proposed scheme provides a high degree of detection accuracy

separately and combine the learned representations to get the final trajectory
embedding. Extensive experiments on three real-world temporal graph datasets

order to make cross section measurements of low energy protons in argon. To
explore the energy region comparable to hadrons produced by GeV-scale neutrino
interactions at oscillation experiments, i.e., near 0.1 GeV of kinetic energy,
methods of moderating the T10 beam were employed: the dual technique of
moderating the beam with acrylic blocks and measuring scattered protons off the
beam axis was used to decrease the kinetic energy of incident protons, as well
as change the proton/minimum ionising particle (MIP) composition of the
incident flux. Measurements of the beam properties were made using time of
flight systems upstream and downstream of the TPC. The kinetic energy of
protons reaching the TPC was successfully changed from $\sim0.3$ GeV without
moderator blocks to less than 0.1 GeV with four moderator blocks (40 cm path
length). The flux of both protons and MIPs off the beam axis was increased. The
ratio of protons to MIPs vary as a function of the off-axis angle allowing for
possible optimisation of the detector to select the type of required particles.
Simulation informed by the time of flight measurements show that with four
moderator blocks placed in the beamline, ($5.6 \pm 0.1$) protons with energies

mechanisms have always been associated with two main features: excitonic
interaction-induced CDW charge order and electron-phonon coupling-induced
periodic lattice distortion (PLD). Here, beyond these two mechanisms, we reveal
that photoexcitation induced CDW phase transition in the prototypic CDW example
1T-TiSe2 is similar to a puppet on a string: six Ti-Se bonds connected to each
distorted Ti atom acting as six strings controlling the PLD and in turn the CDW
orders. The photoexcitation induced modulation on charge population of the
Ti-Se bonds generates a laser-fluence-dependent interatomic-repulsive force
along each Ti-Se bond. The nonequal length of these six Ti-Se bonds gives rise
to a net force exerted on the central distorted Ti atom to push it toward the
suppressing of the PLD and thus the CDW orders. We further illustrate that the
dynamics of each distorted Ti atom behaves as though it attached to a spring in
a simple harmonic motion with a fluence-dependent oscillation frequency,
uniting two previously reported scaling laws for phase transition time. These
findings significantly advance the understanding of CDW instability and provide
new insights into how photoexcitation induced modulation on charge population

a lower dissolution temperature and thus reentrant phase behavior. Moreover, we
find a discontinuous thermodynamic phase transition in the composition of the

in the degree of vertical locality they assume for diagnosing cloud cover from
coarse-grained atmospheric state variables. The NNs accurately estimate
sub-grid scale cloud cover from coarse-grained data that has similar

ultimately help to prevent millions of total joint replacement surgeries
performed annually. Here, we present a multi-modal machine learning-based OA
progression prediction model that utilizes raw radiographic data, clinical
examination results and previous medical history of the patient. We validated
this approach on an independent test set of 3,918 knee images from 2,129
subjects. Our method yielded area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.79 (0.78-0.81)
and Average Precision (AP) of 0.68 (0.66-0.70). In contrast, a reference
approach, based on logistic regression, yielded AUC of 0.75 (0.74-0.77) and AP
of 0.62 (0.60-0.64). The proposed method could significantly improve the
subject selection process for OA drug-development trials and help the
development of personalized therapeutic plans.

heart of understanding solar activity and, in particular, solar eruptions. A
widespread model, used in many theoretical studies, simulations and the
interpretation of observations is that the basic structure of an active region
is created by the emergence of a large tube of pre-twisted magnetic field.
Despite plausible reasons and the availability of various proxies suggesting
the veracity of this model, there has not yet been any direct observational
evidence of the emergence of large twisted magnetic flux tubes. Thus, the
fundamental question, ""are active regions formed by large twisted flux tubes?""
has remained open. In this work, we answer this question in the affirmative and
provide direct evidence to support this. We do this by investigating a robust
topological quantity, called magnetic winding, in solar observations. This
quantity, combined with other signatures that are currently available, provides
the first direct evidence that large twisted flux tubes do emerge to create
active regions.

differs significantly between Newtonian and Milgromian dynamics (MOND). By
combining previous calculations of this effect with mock observations generated
using a Monte Carlo procedure, we show that this prediction can be tested using
high precision astrometry of Proxima Centauri. This requires ${\approx 10}$
years of observations at an individual epoch precision of $0.5 \, \mu$as,
within the design specifications of the proposed Theia mission. In general, the
required duration should scale as the 2/5 power of the astrometric precision. A
long-period planet could produce a MOND-like astrometric signal, but only if it
has a particular ratio of mass to separation squared and a sky position close
to the line segment connecting Proxima Centauri with $\alpha$ Centauri.
Uncertainties in perspective effects should be small enough for this test if
the absolute radial velocity of Proxima Centauri can be measured to within
${\approx 10}$ m/s, better than the present accuracy of 32 m/s. We expect the
required improvement to become feasible using radial velocity zero points
estimated from larger samples of close binaries, with the Sun providing an
anchor. We demonstrate that possible astrometric microlensing of Proxima
Centauri is unlikely to affect the results. We also discuss why it should be
possible to find sufficiently astrometrically stable reference stars.
Adequately addressing these and other issues would enable a decisive test of
gravity in the currently little explored low acceleration regime relevant to
the dynamical discrepancies in galactic outskirts.

method to attack power systems using generated adversarial examples. Black-box
attacks based on transferable characteristics and the above two methods are
also proposed and evaluated. We then adopt adversarial training to defend
systems against adversarial attacks. Experimental analyses demonstrate that our
signal-specific attack method provides less perturbation compared to the FGSM
(Fast Gradient Sign Method), and our signal-agnostic attack method can generate
perturbations fooling most natural signals with high probability. What's more,
the attack method based on the universal signal-agnostic algorithm has a higher
transfer rate of black-box attacks than the attack method based on the
signal-specific algorithm. In addition, the results show that the proposed
adversarial training improves robustness of power systems to adversarial
examples.

well presented for decades in the literature. However, the residual patterns
due to errors in the pulsar acceleration have not been reported previously,
while a pulsar in the galaxy or a globular cluster (GC) will be unavoidably
accelerated. The coupling effect of the pulsar transverse acceleration and the
R$\rm{\ddot{o}}$mer delay on timing residuals are simulated in this work. The
results show that the residual due to the effect can be identified by the
oscillation envelopes of the residuals. It is also shown that the amplitude of
the residual due to the effect is usually relatively small, however, it may
probably be observable for pulsars distributing in the vicinity of the core of
a nearby GC.

analytic phase computation by means of the Kramers- Kronig dispersion relation,
and iterative phase retrieval. Particular attention is paid to the ambiguities
which are unavoidable in the reconstruction of longitudinal charge density

profiles derived from spectroscopic data with those determined with a

confinement and are expected to efficiently mediate the interactions between
light and charge carriers. Despite these expectations, the electromagnetic
detectors exploiting 2d plasmon resonance have been so far inferior to their
non-resonant counterparts. Here, we theoretically analyse the origin of these
failures, and suggest a proper niche for 2d plasmonics in electromagnetic wave
detection. We find that a confined 2DES supporting plasmon resonance has an
upper limit of absorption cross-section, which is identical to that of simple
metallic dipole antenna. Small size of plasmonic resonators implies their weak
dipole moments and impeded coupling to free-space radiation. Achieving the
'dipole limit' of absorption cross-section in isolated 2DES is possible either
at unrealistically long carrier momentum relaxation times, or at resonant
frequencies below units of terahertz. We further show that amendment of even
small metal contacts to 2DES promotes the coupling and reduces the fundamental
mode frequency. The contacted resonators can still have deep-subwavelength
size. They can be merged into compact arrays of detectors, where signals from
elements tuned to different frequencies are summed up. Such arrays may find
applications in multi-channel wireless communications, hyper-spectral imaging,

information about the fraction of people that like the items. How much
information remains? For example, how confident can we be that more people
prefer item A to item B if item A had hundreds of upvotes on Reddit and item B
had only a few? We investigate using an Internet game called GuessTheKarma that
collects independent preference judgments (N=20,674) for 400 pairs of images,
approximately 50 per pair. Unlike the rating systems that dominate social media
services, GuessTheKarma is devoid of social and ranking effects that influence

participated in all the provided languages for all subtasks except sub-task-A
for the English language. Two main approaches have been developed the first is
performed to tackle both languages Arabic and English, a weighted ensemble
consists of Bi-GRU and CNN followed by Gaussian noise and global pooling layer
multiplied by weights to improve the overall performance. The second is
performed for other languages, a transfer learning from BERT beside the
recurrent neural networks such as Bi-LSTM and Bi-GRU followed by a global
average pooling layer. Word embedding and contextual embedding have been used
as features, moreover, data augmentation has been used only for the Arabic
language.

  Costs",,,,,cs.LG stat.ML,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The ability to compare and align related datasets living in heterogeneous
spaces plays an increasingly important role in machine learning. The
Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) formalism can help tackle this problem. Its main goal
is to seek an assignment (more generally a coupling matrix) that can register
points across otherwise incomparable datasets. As a non-convex and quadratic
generalization of optimal transport (OT), GW is NP-hard. Yet, heuristics are
known to work reasonably well in practice, the state of the art approach being
to solve a sequence of nested regularized OT problems. While popular, that
heuristic remains too costly to scale, with cubic complexity in the number of
samples $n$. We show in this paper how a recent variant of the Sinkhorn
algorithm can substantially speed up the resolution of GW. That variant
restricts the set of admissible couplings to those admitting a low rank
factorization as the product of two sub-couplings. By updating alternatively
each sub-coupling, our algorithm computes a stationary point of the problem in
quadratic time with respect to the number of samples. When cost matrices have
themselves low rank, our algorithm has time complexity $\mathcal{O}(n)$. We
demonstrate the efficiency of our method on simulated and real data.

real-world applications. However, recent studies have shown that GNNs are
vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we study a
recently-introduced realistic attack scenario on graphs -- graph injection
attack (GIA). In the GIA scenario, the adversary is not able to modify the
existing link structure and node attributes of the input graph, instead the
attack is performed by injecting adversarial nodes into it. We present an
analysis on the topological vulnerability of GNNs under GIA setting, based on
which we propose the Topological Defective Graph Injection Attack (TDGIA) for
effective injection attacks. TDGIA first introduces the topological defective
edge selection strategy to choose the original nodes for connecting with the
injected ones. It then designs the smooth feature optimization objective to
generate the features for the injected nodes. Extensive experiments on
large-scale datasets show that TDGIA can consistently and significantly
outperform various attack baselines in attacking dozens of defense GNN models.
Notably, the performance drop on target GNNs resultant from TDGIA is more than
double the damage brought by the best attack solution among hundreds of
submissions on KDD-CUP 2020.

no energy decrement at the end of an arbitrary cyclic driving of the model
Hamiltonian. When applied to an increasing number of copies of the initial
density matrix, the requirement of passivity induces a hierarchical ordering
which, in the asymptotic limit of infinitely many elements, pinpoints ground
states and thermal Gibbs states. In particular, for large values of N the
energy content of a N-passive state which is also structurally stable (i.e.
capable to maintain its passivity status under small perturbations of the model
Hamiltonian), is expected to be close to the corresponding value of the thermal
Gibbs state which has the same entropy. In the present paper we provide a
quantitative assessment of this fact, by producing an upper bound for the
energy of an arbitrary N-passive, structurally stable state which only depends
on the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian of the system. We also show the
condition under which our inequality can be saturated. A generalization of the
bound is finally presented that, for sufficiently large N, applies to states
which are N-passive, but not necessarily structurally stable.

their residence, and their usual destination. The proposed model allows both a
fast computation of the spatio-temporal pattern of the epidemic trajectory and.
the analytical calculation of the epidemic threshold. This threshold is found
as the spectral radius of a mixing matrix encapsulating the residential

encoder and a decoder, which provide a straightforward way to map n-dimensional
data in input space to a lower m-dimensional representation space and back. The
decoder itself defines an m-dimensional manifold in input space. Inspired by
manifold learning, we show that the decoder can be trained on its own by
learning the representations of the training samples along with the decoder
weights using gradient descent. A sum-of-squares loss then corresponds to
optimizing the manifold to have the smallest Euclidean distance to the training
samples, and similarly for other loss functions. We derive expressions for the
number of samples needed to specify the encoder and decoder and show that the
decoder generally requires much less training samples to be well-specified
compared to the encoder. We discuss training of autoencoders in this
perspective and relate to previous work in the field that use noisy training
examples and other types of regularization. On the natural image data sets
MNIST and CIFAR10, we demonstrate that the decoder is much better suited to
learn a low-dimensional representation, especially when trained on small data
sets. Using simulated gene regulatory data, we further show that the decoder
alone leads to better generalization and meaningful representations. Our
approach of training the decoder alone facilitates representation learning even
on small data sets and can lead to improved training of autoencoders. We hope
that the simple analyses presented will also contribute to an improved
conceptual understanding of representation learning.

(ICM). In this paper, we focused on the jellyfish galaxy JO201. By combining
archival Chandra observations, MUSE H$\alpha$ cubes, and maps of the emission
fraction of the diffuse ionised gas, we investigated both its high energy
spectral properties and the spatial correlation between its X-ray and optical
emissions. The X-ray emission of JO201 is provided by both the Compton thick
AGN (L$_{\text{X}}^{0.5-10 \text{keV}}$=2.7$\cdot$10$^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$, not
corrected for intrinsic absorption) and an extended component
(L$_{\text{X}}^{0.5-10 \, \text{keV}}\approx$1.9-4.5$\cdot$10$^{41}$ erg
s$^{-1}$) produced by a warm plasma (kT$\approx$1 keV), whose luminosity is
higher than expected from the observed star formation
(L$_{\text{X}}\sim$3.8$\cdot10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$). The spectral analysis
showed that the X-ray emission is consistent with the thermal cooling of hot
plasma. These properties are similar to the ones found in other jellyfish
galaxies showing extended X-ray emission. A point-to-point analysis revealed
that this X-ray emission closely follows the ISM distribution, whereas CLOUDY
simulations proved that the ionisation triggered by this warm plasma would be
able to reproduce the [OI]/H$\alpha$ excess observed in JO201. We conclude that
the galactic X-ray emitting plasma is originated on the surface of the ISM as a
result of the ICM-ISM interplay. This process would entail the cooling and
accretion of the ICM onto the galaxy, which could additionally fuel the star
formation, and the emergence of [OI]/H$\alpha$ excess in the optical spectrum.

analysis (DCA)--a highly successful method for analyzing amino acid sequence
data--in inferring pairwise interactions from samples of ferromagnetic Ising
models on random graphs. Our approach allows for physically motivated
exploration of qualitatively distinct data regimes separated by phase
transitions. We show that inference quality depends strongly on the nature of
generative models: optimal accuracy occurs at an intermediate temperature where
the detrimental effects from macroscopic order and thermal noise are minimal.
Importantly our results indicate that DCA does not always outperform its
local-statistics-based predecessors; while DCA excels at low temperatures, it
becomes inferior to simple correlation thresholding at virtually all
temperatures when data are limited. Our findings offer new insights into the
regime in which DCA operates so successfully and more broadly how inference

properties. In particular, the first equation violates the invariance under the
action of the parity and charge conjugation operations. Although it is a good
mathematical tool to describe the dynamics of a space-like particle, it also
shows that the mean particle velocity is subluminal. In contrast, the second
equation is invariant under the action of parity and charge conjugation
symmetries, but the particle it describes is consistent with the classical
dynamics of a tachyon. This study shows that it is not possible with the
currently available theories to formulate a covariant equation that coherently
describes the neutrino in the framework of the physics of tachyons, and
depending on the experiment, one equation rather than the other should be used.

the Function as a Service approach), new challenges arise constantly for
application developers. This paper presents a design and development
environment that aims to ease application evolution and migration to the new
FaaS model, based on the widely used Node-RED open source tool. The goal of the
environment is to enable a more user friendly and abstract function and
workflow creation for complex FaaS applications. To this end, it bypasses
workflow description and function reuse limitations of the current FaaS
platforms, by providing an extendable, pattern-enriched palette of ready-made,
reusable functionality that can be combined in arbitrary ways. The environment
embeds seamless DevOps processes for generating the deployable artefacts (i.e.
functions and images) of the FaaS platform (Openwhisk). Annotation mechanisms
are also available for the developer to dictate diverse execution options or
management guidelines towards the deployment and operation stacks. The
evaluation is based on case studies of indicative scenarios, including
creating, registering and executing functions and flows based on the Node-RED
runtime, embedding of existing legacy code in a FaaS environment, parallelizing

for the future Lunar Navigation Satellite System (LNSS) to allow for
cost-effectiveness and rapid deployment. However, many design choices are yet

the orbit type. As compared to the legacy Earth-GPS, designing an LNSS poses
unique challenges: (a) restricted Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) of the onboard
clock, which limits the timing stability; (b) limited lunar ground monitoring
stations, which engenders a greater preference toward stable LNSS satellite
orbits.
  In this current work, we analyze the trade-off between different design
considerations related to the onboard clock and the lunar orbit type for
designing an LNSS with time-transfer from Earth-GPS. Our proposed time-transfer
architecture combines the intermittently available Earth-GPS signals in a
timing filter to alleviate the cost and SWaP requirements of the onboard
clocks. Specifically, we conduct multiple case studies with different grades of
low-SWaP clocks and various previously studied lunar orbit types. We estimate
the lunar User Equivalent Range Error (UERE) metric to characterize the ranging
accuracy of signals transmitted from an LNSS satellite. Using the Systems Tool
Kit (STK)-based simulation setup from Analytical Graphics, Inc. (AGI), we
evaluate the lunar UERE across various case studies of the LNSS design to
demonstrate comparable performance as that of the legacy Earth-GPS, even while
using a low-SWaP onboard clock. We further perform sensitivity analysis to
investigate the variation in the lunar UERE metric across different case
studies as the Earth-GPS measurement update rates are varied.

in an image. Existing SGG approaches often use multi-stage pipelines to
decompose this task into object detection, relation graph construction, and
dense or dense-to-sparse relation prediction. Instead, from a perspective on
SGG as a direct set prediction, this paper presents a simple, sparse, and
unified framework for relation detection, termed as Structured Sparse R-CNN.
The key to our method is a set of learnable triplet queries and structured
triplet detectors which could be jointly optimized from the training set in an
end-to-end manner. Specifically, the triplet queries encode the general prior
for entity pair locations, categories, and their relations, and provide an
initial guess of relation detection for subsequent refinement. The triplet
detector presents a cascaded dynamic head design to progressively refine the
results of relation detection. In addition, to relieve the training difficulty
of Structured Sparse R-CNN, we propose a relaxed and enhanced training strategy
based on knowledge distillation from a Siamese Sparse R-CNN. We also propose

with a photo-switchable scaffold such as azobenzene to be activated with light.
In principle, photoswitches with desired photophysical properties like high
isomerization quantum yields can be identified through virtual screening with
reactive simulations. In practice, these simulations are rarely used for
screening, since they require hundreds of trajectories and expensive quantum
chemical methods to account for non-adiabatic excited state effects. Here we
introduce a diabatic artificial neural network (DANN) based on diabatic states
to accelerate such simulations for azobenzene derivatives. The network is six
orders of magnitude faster than the quantum chemistry method used for training.
DANN is transferable to azobenzene molecules outside the training set,
predicting quantum yields for unseen species that are correlated with
experiment. We use the model to virtually screen 3,100 hypothetical molecules,
and identify novel species with extremely high predicted quantum yields. The
model predictions are confirmed using high accuracy non-adiabatic dynamics. Our
results pave the way for fast and accurate virtual screening of photoactive

orbiting the nearby ($d$ = 27.5 pc), M3V star TOI-1231 (NLTT 24399, L 248-27,
2MASS J10265947-5228099). The planet was detected using photometric data from
the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and followed up with observations
from the Las Cumbres Observatory and the Antarctica Search for Transiting
ExoPlanets program. Combining the photometric data sets, we find that the newly
discovered planet has a radius of 3.65$^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$ R$_{\oplus}$, and an
orbital period of 24.246 days. Radial velocity measurements obtained with the
Planet Finder Spectrograph on the Magellan Clay telescope confirm the existence
of the planet and lead to a mass measurement of 15.5$\pm$3.3 M$_{\oplus}$. With
an equilibrium temperature of just 330K TOI-1231 b is one of the coolest small
planets accessible for atmospheric studies thus far, and its host star's bright
NIR brightness (J=8.88, K$_{s}$=8.07) make it an exciting target for HST and
JWST. Future atmospheric observations would enable the first comparative
planetology efforts in the 250-350 K temperature regime via comparisons with
K2-18 b. Furthermore, TOI-1231's high systemic radial velocity (70.5 k\ms) may
allow for the detection of low-velocity hydrogen atoms escaping the planet by
Doppler shifting the H I Ly-alpha stellar emission away from the geocoronal and
ISM absorption features.

  colonies",,,,,physics.bio-ph cond-mat.soft q-bio.CB,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The motion of cells in tissues is an ubiquitous phenomenon. In particular, in
monolayered cell colonies in vitro, pronounced collective behavior with
swirl-like motion has been observed deep within a cell colony, while at the
same time, the colony remains cohesive, with not a single cell escaping at the
edge. Thus, the colony displays liquid-like properties inside, in coexistence
with a cell-free ""vacuum"" outside. How can adhesion be strong enough to keep
cells together, while at the same time not jam the system in a glassy state?
What kind of minimal model can describe such a behavior? Which other signatures
of activity arise from the internal fluidity? We propose a novel active
Brownian particle model with attraction, in which the interaction potential has
a broad minimum to give particles enough wiggling space to be collectively in
the fluid state. We demonstrate that for moderate propulsion, this model can
generate the fluid-vacuum coexistence described above. In addition, the
combination of the fluid nature of the colony with cohesion leads to preferred
orientation of the cell polarity, pointing outward, at the edge, which in turn
gives rise to a tensile stress in the colony -- as observed experimentally for
epithelial sheets. For stronger propulsion, collective detachment of cell
clusters is predicted. Further addition of an alignment preference of cell
polarity and velocity direction results in enhanced coordinated, swirl-like
motion, increased tensile stress and cell-cluster detachment.

training speech enhancement without the need of a single isolated in-domain
speech nor a noise waveform. Our approach overcomes limitations of previous
methods which make them dependent on clean in-domain target signals and thus,
sensitive to any domain mismatch between train and test samples. RemixIT is
based on a continuous self-training scheme in which a pre-trained teacher model
on out-of-domain data infers estimated pseudo-target signals for in-domain
mixtures. Then, by permuting the estimated clean and noise signals and remixing
them together, we generate a new set of bootstrapped mixtures and corresponding
pseudo-targets which are used to train the student network. Vice-versa, the
teacher periodically refines its estimates using the updated parameters of the
latest student models. Experimental results on multiple speech enhancement
datasets and tasks not only show the superiority of our method over prior
approaches but also showcase that RemixIT can be combined with any separation
model as well as be applied towards any semi-supervised and unsupervised domain
adaptation task. Our analysis, paired with empirical evidence, sheds light on
the inside functioning of our self-training scheme wherein the student model
keeps obtaining better performance while observing severely degraded
pseudo-targets.

estimation of the transverse distribution in the rectangular channel of bed and
wall shear stresses. This study makes use of the Tsallis entropy, genetic
programming (GP) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) methods to
assess the shear stress distribution (SSD) in the rectangular channel. To
evaluate the results of the Tsallis entropy, GP and ANFIS models, laboratory
observations were used in which shear stress was measured using an optimized
Preston tube. This is then used to measure the SSD in various aspect ratios in
the rectangular channel. To investigate the shear stress percentage, 10 data
series with a total of 112 different data were used. The results of the
sensitivity analysis show that the most influential parameter for the SSD in a
smooth rectangular channel is the dimensionless parameter B/H, Where the
transverse coordinate is B, and the flow depth is H. With the parameters (b/B),
(B/H) for the bed and (z/H), (B/H) for the wall as inputs, the modeling of the
GP was better than the other one. Based on the analysis, it can be concluded
that the use of GP and ANFIS algorithms is more effective in estimating shear
stress in smooth rectangular channels than the Tsallis entropy-based equations.

applications is required to distinguish irregular situations. For this reason,
there has been a growing interest in the anomaly detection (AD) task. Since we
cannot observe abnormal samples for most of the cases, recent AD methods
attempt to formulate it as a task of classifying whether the sample is normal
or not. However, they potentially fail when the given normal samples are
inherited from diverse semantic labels. To tackle this problem, we introduce a
latent class-condition-based AD scenario. In addition, we propose a
confidence-based self-labeling AD framework tailored to our proposed scenario.
Since our method leverages the hidden class information, it successfully avoids
generating the undesirable loose decision region that one-class methods suffer.
Our proposed framework outperforms the recent one-class AD methods in the
latent multi-class scenarios.

approximation under any Schatten-$p$ norm. Here, given access to a matrix $A$
through matrix-vector products, an accuracy parameter $\epsilon$, and a target
rank $k$, the goal is to find a rank-$k$ matrix $Z$ with orthonormal columns
such that $\| A(I -ZZ^\top)\|_{S_p} \leq (1+\epsilon)\min_{U^\top U = I_k}
\|A(I - U U^\top)\|_{S_p}$, where $\|M\|_{S_p}$ denotes the $\ell_p$ norm of
the the singular values of $M$. For the special cases of $p=2$ (Frobenius norm)
and $p = \infty$ (Spectral norm), Musco and Musco (NeurIPS 2015) obtained an
algorithm based on Krylov methods that uses $\tilde{O}(k/\sqrt{\epsilon})$
matrix-vector products, improving on the na\""ive $\tilde{O}(k/\epsilon)$
dependence obtainable by the power method, where $\tilde{O}$ suppresses
poly$(\log(dk/\epsilon))$ factors.
  Our main result is an algorithm that uses only
$\tilde{O}(kp^{1/6}/\epsilon^{1/3})$ matrix-vector products, and works for all
$p \geq 1$. For $p = 2$ our bound improves the previous
$\tilde{O}(k/\epsilon^{1/2})$ bound to $\tilde{O}(k/\epsilon^{1/3})$. Since the
Schatten-$p$ and Schatten-$\infty$ norms are the same up to a $1+ \epsilon$
factor when $p \geq (\log d)/\epsilon$, our bound recovers the result of Musco
and Musco for $p = \infty$. Further, we prove a matrix-vector query lower bound
of $\Omega(1/\epsilon^{1/3})$ for any fixed constant $p \geq 1$, showing that
surprisingly $\tilde{\Theta}(1/\epsilon^{1/3})$ is the optimal complexity for
constant~$k$.
  To obtain our results, we introduce several new techniques, including
optimizing over multiple Krylov subspaces simultaneously, and pinching
inequalities for partitioned operators. Our lower bound for $p \in [1,2]$ uses
the Araki-Lieb-Thirring trace inequality, whereas for $p>2$, we appeal to a
norm-compression inequality for aligned partitioned operators.

the upper levels are mainly populated from C III reservoir through the Rydberg

to photon losses in UV transitions at 885, 1308, and 1426--28~\AA\ which become
optically thin in the photosphere. We analysed the lines of C I, C II, C III,

fingers as a soft hand to identify the bifurcation of manipulated objects
during the in-hand manipulation process. The manipulation is performed by
breaking the symmetry method with an underactuated control system by
bifurcating the object to clockwise or counter-clockwise rotations. Two soft
sensors are embedded in parallel over a single soft finger, and the difference
in the resistance measurements is compared when the finger is displaced or bent
in a particular direction, which can identify the bifurcation direction and aid
in the break of symmetry approach without the need of external tracking
devices. The sensors performance is also characterised by extending and bending
the finger without an object interaction. During an experiment that performs a
break of symmetry, manipulated objects turn clockwise and counter-clockwise
depending on the perturbation and actuation frequency, sensors can track the
direction of rotation. The embedded sensors provide a self-sensing capability
for implementing a closed-loop control in future work. The soft ring actuator
performance presents a self-organisation behaviour with soft fingers rotating
an object without a required control for rotating the object. Therefore, the
soft fingers are an underactuated system with complex behaviour when
interacting with objects that serve in-hand manipulation field.

stars. Their intense radiation fields are believed to efficiently remove the
small dust grains that are constantly replenished by collisions. For lower-mass
stars, in particular M-stars, the dust removal mechanism needs to be further
investigated given the much weaker radiation field produced by these objects.
Aims. We present new polarimetric observations of the nearly edge-on disk
around the pre-main sequence M-type star GSC 07396-00759, taken with VLT/SPHERE
IRDIS, with the aim to better understand the morphology of the disk, its dust
properties, and the star-disk interaction via the stellar mass-loss rate.
Methods. We model our observations to characterize the location and properties
of the dust grains using the Henyey-Greenstein approximation of the polarized
phase function and evaluate the strength of the stellar winds. Results. We find
that the observations are best described by an extended and highly inclined
disk ($i\approx 84.3\,^{\circ}\pm0.3$) with a dust distribution centered at a
radius $r_{0}\approx107\pm2$ au. The polarized phase function $S_{12}$ is best
reproduced by an anisotropic scattering factor $g\approx0.6$ and small
micron-sized dust grains with sizes $s>0.3\,\mathrm{\mu}$m. We furthermore
discuss some of the caveats of the approach and a degeneracy between the grain
size and the porosity. Conclusions. Even though the radius of the disk may be
over-estimated, our results suggest that using a given scattering theory might
not be sufficient to fully explain key aspects such as the shape of the phase
function, or the dust grain size. With the caveats in mind, we find that the
average mass-loss rate of GSC 07396-00759 can be up to 500 times stronger than
that of the Sun, supporting the idea that stellar winds from low-mass stars can
evacuate small dust grains from the disk.

allow follow up research on building predictive models of them. For this
purpose, we align all the Wikipedia articles in a language-agnostic manner
according to the concept they cover, which results in 13M propagation
instances. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset is the first to explore
the full inter-language propagation at a large scale. Together with the
dataset, a holistic overview of the propagation and key insights about the
underlying structural factors are provided to aid future research. For example,
we find that although long cascades are unusual, the propagation tends to
continue further once it reaches more than four language editions. We also find
that the size of language editions is associated with the speed of propagation.
We believe the dataset not only contributes to the prior literature on

extremely large pre-trained language models (PLMs), which could achieve
comparable performance to full-parameter fine-tuning by only tuning a few soft
prompts. However, compared to fine-tuning, PT empirically requires much more
training steps. To explore whether we can improve the efficiency of PT by
reusing trained soft prompts and sharing learned knowledge, we empirically
investigate the transferability of soft prompts across different tasks and
models. In cross-task transfer, we find that trained soft prompts can well
transfer to similar tasks and initialize PT for them to accelerate training and
improve performance. Moreover, to explore what factors influence prompts'
transferability across tasks, we investigate how to measure the prompt
similarity and find that the overlapping rate of activated neurons highly
correlates to the transferability. In cross-model transfer, we explore how to
project the prompts of a PLM to another PLM and successfully train a kind of
projector which can achieve non-trivial transfer performance on similar tasks.
However, initializing PT with the projected prompts does not work well, which
may be caused by optimization preferences and PLMs' high redundancy. Our
findings show that improving PT with knowledge transfer is possible and
promising, while prompts' cross-task transferability is generally better than
the cross-model transferability.

modality-specific decoder models from the class of generalized linear models.
Both an expectation-maximization and a variational inference algorithm for

channel estimation is essential and usually requires excessive channel training
overhead when the number of IRS reflecting elements is large. The acquisition
of accurate channel state information (CSI) becomes more challenging when the
channel is not quasi-static due to the mobility of the transmitter and/or
receiver. In this work, we study an IRS-aided wireless communication system
with a time-varying channel model and propose an innovative two-stage
transmission protocol. In the first stage, we send pilot symbols and track the
direct/reflected channels based on the received signal, and then data signals
are transmitted. In the second stage, instead of sending pilot symbols first,
we directly predict the direct/reflected channels and all the time slots are
used for data transmission. Based on the proposed transmission protocol, we
propose a two-stage channel tracking and prediction (2SCTP) scheme to obtain
the direct and reflected channels with low channel training overhead, which is
achieved by exploiting the temporal correlation of the time-varying channels.
Specifically, we first consider a special case where the IRS-access point (AP)
channel is assumed to be static, for which a Kalman filter (KF)-based algorithm
and a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based neural network are proposed for
channel tracking and prediction, respectively. Then, for the more general case
where the IRS-AP, user-IRS and user-AP channels are all assumed to be
time-varying, we present a generalized KF (GKF)-based channel tracking
algorithm, where proper approximations are employed to handle the underlying
non-Gaussian random variables. Numerical simulations are provided to verify the
effectiveness of our proposed transmission protocol and channel
tracking/prediction algorithms as compared to existing ones.

non-connected human-driven vehicles. We develop a novel Markov decision process

the uncertainty of drivers' yielding pattern to approaching EMVs. Based on
pairs of neural networks representing actors and critics for agent vehicles, we
develop a multi-agent actor-critic deep reinforcement learning algorithm that
handles a varying number of vehicles and a random proportion of connected

indirect and direct reinforcement learning, we present two schemata to address
multi-agent reinforcement learning on this connected vehicle application. Both
approaches are validated, on a micro-simulation testbed SUMO, to establish a

and complex systems requires considering interactions of different types. All
these considerations imply a real challenge for computational chemistry. Using
quantum methods for the entire system requires significant computational
resources, with improvements in parallelization and optimization of theoretical
strategies. Computational methods, such as LS-DFT and DLPNO-CCSD(T), may allow
performing ab initio QM calculations, including explicitly the electronic
structure for large biological systems, at a reasonable computing time. In this
work, we study the interaction of small molecules and cations with DNA
(duplex-DNA and G-quadruplexes), comparing different computational methods: a
linear-scaling DFT (LS-DFT) at LMKLL/DZDP level of theory, semi-empirical
methods (PM6-DH2 and PM7), mixed QM/MM, and DLPNO-CCSD(T). Our goal is to
demonstrate the adequacy of LS-DFT to treat the different types of interactions
present in DNA-dependent systems. We show that LMKLL/DZDP using SIESTA can
yield very accurate geometries and energetics in all the different systems
considered in this work: duplex DNA (dDNA), phenanthroline intercalating dDNA,
G-quadruplexes, and Metal-G-tetrads considering alkaline metals of different

geometry optimizations have been carried out using a DFT method thanks to its
linear-scaling capabilities. Moreover, we show that LS-DFT provides
high-quality structures, and some semi-empirical Hamiltonian can also yield
suitable geometries. However, DLPNO-CCSD(T) and LS-DFT are the only methods
that accurately describe interaction energies for all the systems considered in
our study.

estimation (ACE) systems within music information retrieval (MIR) is that
non-chord tones (i.e., notes outside the supporting harmony) contribute to
error during the labeling process. Despite the prevalence of machine learning
approaches in MIR, there are cases where alternative approaches provide a
simpler alternative while allowing for insights into musicological practices.
In this project, we present a statistical model for predicting chord tones
based on music theory rules. Our model is currently focused on predicting chord
tones in classical music, since composition in this style is highly
constrained, theoretically making the placement of chord tones highly
predictable. Indeed, music theorists have labeling systems for every variety of
non-chord tone, primarily classified by the note's metric position and
intervals of approach and departure. Using metric position, duration, and
melodic intervals as predictors, we build a statistical model for predicting
chord tones using the TAVERN dataset. While our probabilistic approach is
similar to other efforts in the domain of automatic harmonic analysis, our
focus is on melodic reduction rather than predicting harmony. However, we hope
to pursue applications for ACE in the future. Finally, we implement our melody
reduction model using an existing symbolic visualization tool, to assist with
melody reduction and non-chord tone identification for computational musicology
researchers and music theorists.

the battery's working condition is confined within this feasible domain.
Equivalent box constraints are then constructed for better computational

We focus on the temperature $T_{\text{max}}$ where specific heat reaches its

radius of 5 nm. The effect of complex optical coupling and thermal accumulation
on the light-induced thermal behavior in plasmonic resonance frequency (around
383 nm) is analyzed by means of the Green\textquotesingle s function approach.
Regime borders of both optical coupling and thermal accumulation effects on the
photothermal behavior of 2D square-lattice nanoparticle ensemble are figured
out clearly and quantitatively. A dimensionless parameter $\varphi$ is defined
as the ratio of full temperature increase to that without considering the
optical coupling or thermal accumulation to quantify the optical coupling and
thermal accumulation effects on photothermal behavior. The more compact the
nanoparticle ensemble is, the stronger the optical coupling on thermal behavior
is. When the lattice spacing increases to tens of nanoparticle radius, the
optical coupling becomes insignificant. When $\varphi \approx 1$ (lattice
spacing increases to hundreds of nanoparticle radius), the thermal accumulation
effects are weak and can be neglected safely. The polarization-dependent
distribution of temperature increase of nanoparticles is observed only in the

propose an effective way of synchronising SLAM systems to deliver seamless
real-time localisation of multiple edge devices at the same time. All this in
the presence of network latency and bandwidth limitations. The resulting system
is deployed and tested at scale in San Francisco where it delivers AR
experiences in a mapped area of several hundred kilometers. To foster further
development of this area we offer the data set to the public, constituting the
largest of this kind to date.

researched for the last few years to handle variety of massively distributed AI
applications to meet up the strict latency requirements. Meanwhile, many
companies have released edge devices with smaller form factors (low power
consumption and limited resources) like the popular Raspberry Pi and Nvidia's
Jetson Nano for acting as compute nodes at the edge computing environments.
Although the edge devices are limited in terms of computing power and hardware
resources, they are powered by accelerators to enhance their performance
behavior. Therefore, it is interesting to see how AI-based Deep Neural Networks
perform on such devices with limited resources.
  In this work, we present and compare the performance in terms of inference
time and power consumption of the four Systems on a Chip (SoCs): Asus Tinker
Edge R, Raspberry Pi 4, Google Coral Dev Board, Nvidia Jetson Nano, and one
microcontroller: Arduino Nano 33 BLE, on different deep learning models and
frameworks. We also provide a method for measuring power consumption, inference
time and accuracy for the devices, which can be easily extended to other
devices. Our results showcase that, for Tensorflow based quantized model, the
Google Coral Dev Board delivers the best performance, both for inference time
and power consumption. For a low fraction of inference computation time, i.e.
less than 29.3% of the time for MobileNetV2, the Jetson Nano performs faster
than the other devices.

key ideas in devising the method are the use of a Nitsche-type boundary penalty
technique to weakly enforce the boundary conditions and a scaling of the
weighting parameter in the stabilization operator that compares the singular
perturbation parameter to the square of the local mesh size. With these ideas
in hand, we derive stability and optimal error estimates over the whole range
of values for the singular perturbation parameter, including the zero value for
which a second-order elliptic problem is recovered. Numerical experiments

reduce many meta-learning algorithms to instances of supervised learning. This
view not only unifies meta-learning into an intuitive and practical framework
but also allows us to transfer insights from supervised learning directly to
improve meta-learning. For example, we obtain a better understanding of
generalization properties, and we can readily transfer well-understood
techniques, such as model ensemble, pre-training, joint training, data

analogy of these methods in the context of meta-learning and show that they
give rise to significant improvements in model performance on few-shot

insights to COVID-19 policy challenges. The Datathon was designed to (1)
develop operationalizable data-driven models to address COVID-19 health-policy
challenges and (2) build a community of researchers from academia, industry,
and government and rebuild their trust in the government. Three specific
challenges were defined based on their relevance (significance, data
availability, and potential to anonymize the data): immunization policies,
special needs of the young population, and populations whose rate of compliance
with COVID-19 testing is low. The MoH team extracted diverse, reliable,
up-to-date, and deidentified governmental datasets for each challenge. Secure
remote-access research environments with relevant data science tools were set
on Amazon Web. The MoH screened the applicants and accepted around 80
participants, teaming them to balance areas of expertise as well as represent
all sectors of the community. One week following the event, anonymous surveys
for participants and mentors were distributed to assess overall usefulness and
points for improvement. The 48-hour Datathon and pre-event sessions included 18
multidisciplinary teams, mentored by 20 data scientists, 6 epidemiologists, 5
presentation mentors, and 12 judges. The insights developed by the 3 winning
teams are currently considered by the MoH as potential data science methods
relevant for national policies. The most positive results were increased trust
in the MoH and greater readiness to work with the government on these or future
projects. Detailed feedback offered concrete lessons for improving the

indistinguishability from models retrained after removing the deletion set. We
argue that achieving indistinguishability is unnecessary and its practical
relaxations are insufficient. We formulate the goal of unlearning as forgetting
all information specific to the deletion set while maintaining high utility and
resource efficiency.
  We introduce a novel test for forgetting called Interclass Confusion (IC).
Despite being a black-box test, IC can investigate whether information from the
deletion set was erased until the early layers of the network. We analyze two
aspects of forgetting: (i) memorization and (ii) property generalization. We
empirically show that two simple unlearning methods, exact-unlearning and
catastrophic-forgetting the final k layers of a network, outperforms prior
unlearning methods when scaled to large deletion sets. Overall, we believe our
formulation and the IC test will guide the design of better unlearning
algorithms.

applied to several combinatorial optimization problems in its zero-temperature
implementation, the max-sum algorithm. In particular, recent developments to
solve the edge-disjoint paths problem and the prize-collecting Steiner tree
problem on graphs have shown remarkable results for several classes of graphs
and for benchmark instances. Here we propose a generalization of these
techniques for two variants of the Steiner trees packing problem where multiple
""interacting"" trees have to be sought within a given graph. Depending on the
interaction among trees we distinguish the vertex-disjoint Steiner trees
problem, where trees cannot share nodes, from the edge-disjoint Steiner trees
problem, where edges cannot be shared by trees but nodes can be members of
multiple trees. Several practical problems of huge interest in network design
can be mapped into these two variants, for instance, the physical design of
Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) chips. The formalism described here relies
on two components edge-variables that allows us to formulate a massage-passing
algorithm for the V-DStP and two algorithms for the E-DStP differing in the
scaling of the computational time with respect to some relevant parameters. We
will show that one of the two formalisms used for the edge-disjoint variant
allow us to map the max-sum update equations into a weighted maximum matching
problem over proper bipartite graphs. We developed a heuristic procedure based
on the max-sum equations that shows excellent performance in synthetic networks
(in particular outperforming standard multi-step greedy procedures by large
margins) and on large benchmark instances of VLSI for which the optimal
solution is known, on which the algorithm found the optimum in two cases and
the gap to optimality was never larger than 4 %.

  interaction",Under Review,,,,physics.flu-dyn physics.ao-ph,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) is a well tested approach for
specifying the fluxes when the roughness surfaces are homogeneous. For flow
over waves (inhomogeneous surfaces), phase-averaged roughness length scales are
often prescribed through models based on the wave characteristics and the wind
speed. However, such approaches lack generalizability over different wave ages
and steepnesses due to the reliance on model coefficients tuned to specific
datasets. In this paper, a sea surface-based hydrodynamic drag model applicable
to moving surfaces is developed to model the pressure-based surface drag felt
by the wind due to the waves. The model is based on the surface gradient
approach of \textit{Anderson & Meneveau (2010)} applicable to stationary
obstacles and extended here to the wind-wave problem. The wave drag model
proposed specifies the hydrodynamic force based on the incoming momentum flux,
peak wave phase speed, and the surface frontal area. The drag coefficient
associated with the wind-wave momentum exchange is determined based on the wave
steepness. The wave drag model is used to simulate turbulent airflow above a
monochromatic wave train with different wave ages and wave steepnesses. The
mean velocity profiles and model form stresses are validated with available
lab-scale experimental data and show good agreement across a wide range of wave
steepnesses and wave ages. The drag force is correlated with the wave surface
gradient, and out-of-phase with the wave height distribution by a factor
$\pi/2$ for the sinusoidal wave-train considered. The computational savings are
significant over phase-resolved models with the effect of the waves on the mean
velocity profiles well represented. These results demonstrate that the current
approach is sufficiently general over a wide parameter space compared to wave
phase-averaged models with a minimal increase in computational cost.

polarization. We demonstrate numerically, a scheme that induces chirality in
the cavity modes, thereby achieving a cavity that supports intrinsic circular
polarization. By selectively modifying two air holes around the cavity, the
dipole modes could interact via asymmetric coherent backscattering which is a
non-Hermitian process. With suitable air hole parameters, the cavity modes
approach the exceptional point, coalescing in frequencies and linewidths as
well as giving rise to significant circular polarization close to unity. The
handedness of the chirality can be selected depending on the choice of the

describe the data acquisition and calibration done by the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observatory and the subsequent
calibration and imaging we performed. The image products are combinations of
multiple 12m array configurations created from a selection of the observed
bandwidth using multi-term, multi-frequency synthesis imaging and
deconvolution. The data products are self-calibrated and exhibit substantial
noise improvements over the images produced from the delivered data. We compare
different choices of continuum selection, calibration parameters, and image
weighting parameters, demonstrating the utility and necessity of our additional
processing work. Two variants of continuum selection are used and will be
distributed: the ""best-sensitivity"" data, which include the full bandwidth,
including bright emission lines that contaminate the continuum, and ""cleanest"",
which select portions of the spectrum that are unaffected by line emission. We
present a preliminary analysis of the spectral indices of the continuum data,
showing that the ALMA products are able to clearly distinguish free-free
emission from dust emission, and that in some cases we are able to identify
optically thick emission sources. The data products are made public with this

micro-PMUs, which can record high-resolution data; however, in practice,
micro-PMUs are installed at limited locations in distribution networks due to
budgetary constraints. In contrast, smart meters are widely deployed but can
only measure relatively low-resolution energy consumption, which cannot
sufficiently reflect the actual instantaneous load volatility within each
sampling interval. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach for
enriching load data for service transformers that only have low-resolution
smart meters. The key to our approach is to statistically recover the
high-resolution load data, which is masked by the low-resolution data, using
trained probabilistic models of service transformers that have both high and
low-resolution data sources, i.e, micro-PMUs and smart meters. The overall
framework consists of two steps: first, for the transformers with micro-PMUs, a
Gaussian Process is leveraged to capture the relationship between the
maximum/minimum load and average load within each low-resolution sampling
interval of smart meters; a Markov chain model is employed to characterize the
transition probability of known high-resolution load. Next, the trained models
are used as teachers for the transformers with only smart meters to decompose
known low-resolution load data into targeted high-resolution load data. The
enriched data can recover instantaneous load uncertainty and significantly
enhance distribution system observability and situational awareness. We have
verified the proposed approach using real high- and low-resolution load data.

able to specify the reward function explicitly to the assistant. Instead of
aiming to automate, and act in place of the agent as in current approaches, we
give the assistant an advisory role and keep the agent in the loop as the main
decision maker. The difficulty is that we must account for potential biases
induced by limitations or constraints of the agent which may cause it to
seemingly irrationally reject advice. To do this we introduce a novel
formalization of assistance that models these biases, allowing the assistant to
infer and adapt to them. We then introduce a new method for planning the
assistant's advice which can scale to large decision making problems. Finally,
we show experimentally that our approach adapts to these agent biases, and
results in higher cumulative reward for the agent than automation-based
alternatives.

randomly generated and the process repeats until convergence. By construction,
per iteration, ResIST communicates only a small portion of network parameters
to each machine and never uses the full model during training. Thus, ResIST
reduces the per-iteration communication, memory, and time requirements of
ResNet training to only a fraction of the requirements of full-model training.

considerations and extensive experiments under multiple synthetic and
real-world data sets, using the causal effect variational autoencoder (CEVAE)
as a case study. While CEVAE seems to work reliably under some simple
scenarios, it does not estimate the causal effect correctly with a misspecified

motivation. Hence, our results show that more attention should be paid to

significant degradation in its generalization performance. To resolve this
issue, we propose MARVEL (MARgins Via Early Learning), a new robust learning
method where the memorization of the noisy instances is curbed. We propose a
new test statistic that tracks the goodness of ""fit"" of every instance based on
the epoch-history of its classification margins. If its classification margin
is small in a sequence of consecutive learning epochs, that instance is
declared noisy and the network abandons learning on it. Consequently, the
network first flags a possibly noisy instance, and then waits to see if
learning on that instance can be improved and if not, the network learns with
confidence that this instance can be safely abandoned. We also propose MARVEL+,
where arduous instances can be upweighted, enabling the network to focus and
improve its learning on them and consequently its generalization. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets with synthetic label noise and real-world
datasets show that MARVEL outperforms other baselines consistently across
different noise levels, with a significantly larger margin under asymmetric

points or filtering human-object pairs, ignoring the variability in the

  Issue 3, Article 9",10.22152/programming-journal.org/2018/2/9,,cs.PL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Context. Software development pipelines are used for automating essential
parts of software engineering processes, such as build automation and
continuous integration testing. In particular, interactive pipelines, which
process events in a live environment such as an IDE, require timely results for
low-latency feedback, and persistence to retain low-latency feedback between
restarts.
  Inquiry. Developing an incrementalized and persistent version of a pipeline
is one way to reduce feedback latency, but requires dependency tracking, cache
invalidation, and other complicated techniques. Therefore, interactivity
complicates pipeline development if timeliness and persistence become
responsibilities of the pipeline programmer, rather than being supported by the
underlying system.
  Approach. We develop Pipelines for Interactive Environments (PIE), a
Domain-Specific Language (DSL), API, and runtime for developing interactive
software development pipelines, where ease of development is a focus.
  Knowledge. PIE provides a straightforward programming model that enables
direct and concise expression of pipelines without boilerplate, reducing the
development and maintenance effort of pipelines. Compiled pipeline programs can
be embedded into interactive environments such as code editors and IDEs,
enabling timely feedback at a low cost.
  Grounding. Compared to the state of the art, PIE reduces the code required to
express an interactive pipeline by a factor of 6 in a case study on
syntax-aware editors. Furthermore, we evaluate PIE in two case studies of
complex interactive software development scenarios, demonstrating that PIE can
handle complex interactive pipelines in a straightforward and concise way.

crowded environment. While recent works using deep learning have made
significant advances in the field, they have overlooked the generalization
aspect, which makes them impractical for real-world deployment. The key novelty
of our work is to formalize three critical forms of generalization and propose
experiments to evaluate them: generalization with i) a varying number of
cameras, ii) varying camera positions, and finally, iii) to new scenes. We find
that existing state-of-the-art models show poor generalization by overfitting
to a single scene and camera configuration. To address the concerns: (a) we
propose a novel Generalized MVD (GMVD) dataset, assimilating diverse scenes
with changing daytime, camera configurations, varying number of cameras, and
(b) we discuss the properties essential to bring generalization to MVD and
propose a barebones model to incorporate them. We perform a comprehensive set
of experiments on the WildTrack, MultiViewX, and the GMVD datasets to motivate
the necessity to evaluate the generalization abilities of MVD methods and to

irradiance from their apparent intensity. Taking full-disc observations from
the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we examined the intensity contrast of network
and faculae in the continuum and core of the Fe I 6173 {\AA} line and 1700
{\AA}, including the variation with magnetic flux density, distance from disc
centre, nearby magnetic fields, and time. The brightness of network and faculae
is believed to be suppressed by nearby magnetic fields from its effect on
convection. The difference in intensity contrast between the quiet-Sun network
and active region faculae, noted by various studies, arises because active
regions are more magnetically crowded and is not due to any fundamental
physical differences between network and faculae. These results highlight that
solar irradiance models need to include the effect of nearby magnetic fields on
network and faculae brightness. We found evidence that suggests that departures
from local thermal equilibrium (LTE) might have limited effect on intensity
contrast. This could explain why solar irradiance models that are based on the
intensity contrast of solar surface magnetic features calculated assuming LTE
reproduce the observed spectral variability even where the LTE assumption
breaks down. Certain models of solar irradiance employ chromospheric indices as
direct indications of the effect of network and faculae on solar irradiance.
Based on past studies of the Ca II K line and on the intensity contrast
measurements derived here, we show that the fluctuations in chromospheric
emission from network and faculae are a reasonable estimate of the emission
fluctuations in the middle photosphere, but not of those in the lower
photosphere. The data set, which extends from 2010 to 2018, indicates that
intensity contrast was stable to about 3% in this period.

hyperparameters of these consolidate architectures, in particular their
custom-designed LSTMs constrained by attention schemes. In this research, we
first propose a common network to discover both intra-modal and inter-modal

then propose unique networks to encapsulate temporal-granularity among the
modalities which is essential while extracting information within asynchronous

different in the sense that (a) is a general mechanism whereas (b) is strain
and stress-factor dependent. In this paper we explore major facets of (a).
Firstly, we emphasize that (a) can account for known experimental stress-factor
evidence. Secondly, we observe that (a) rightly predicts that slow exponential
growth (meaning with a doubling time of several hours) results in a lower death
rate than fast exponential growth (doubling time of a fraction of one hour), an
effect that cannot be explained in the (b) framework because both organisms are
in the same phase. Thirdly, we conjecture that the stress-factor effect can be
extended to situations of chronic stress due to non-optimal environmental
conditions. If correct, this conjecture would imply that even in normal culture
conditions the natural death rate is lower in the stationary phase than in the
growth phase. Finally, the paper closes with the description of several open
questions and of appropriate test-experiments meant to address them.

  5G and Beyond Systems",Accepted at IEEE Communications Standards Magazine,,,,eess.SP,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Fifth generation cellular systems support a broad range of services,
including mobile broadband, critical and massive Internet of Things and are
used in a variety of scenarios. In many of these scenarios, the main challenge
is maintaining high throughput and ensuring proper quality of service (QoS) in
irregular topologies. In multiple input multiple output systems, this challenge
translates to designing linear transmit and receive beamformers that maximize
the system throughput and manage QoS constraints. In this paper, we argue that
this basic design task in 5G and beyond systems must be extended such that
beamforming design and user scheduling are managed jointly. Specifically, we
propose a fully decentralized joint beamforming design and user scheduling
algorithm that manages QoS. A novel feature of this scheme is its ability to
reduce the initial rate requirements in case of infeasibility. By means of
simulations that model contemporary 5G scenarios, we show that the proposed
decentralized scheme outperforms benchmarking algorithms that do not support
minimum rate requirements and previously proposed algorithms that support QoS
requirements.

great challenges. Many of the people who have the tendency to suicide share
their thoughts and opinions through social media platforms. As part of many
researches it is observed that the publicly available posts from social media
contain valuable criteria to effectively detect individuals with suicidal
thoughts. The most difficult part to prevent suicide is to detect and
understand the complex risk factors and warning signs that may lead to suicide.
This can be achieved by identifying the sudden changes in a user behavior
automatically. Natural language processing techniques can be used to collect
behavioral and textual features from social media interactions and these
features can be passed to a specially designed framework to detect anomalies in
human interactions that are indicators of suicidal intentions. We can achieve
fast detection of suicidal ideation using deep learning and/or machine learning
based classification approaches. For such a purpose, we can employ the
combination of LSTM and CNN models to detect such emotions from posts of the
users. In order to improve the accuracy, some approaches like using more data
for training, using attention model to improve the efficiency of existing
models etc. could be done. This paper proposes a LSTM-Attention-CNN combined
model to analyze social media submissions to detect any underlying suicidal
intentions. During evaluations, the proposed model demonstrated an accuracy of
90.3 percent and an F1-score of 92.6 percent, which is greater than the
baseline models.

Due to the SPP dispersion, a conventional antenna of fixed geometry, exhibiting
a narrow SPP resonance, cannot simultaneously operate in two different spectral
bands. In contrast, here it is demonstrated that in metallic disks, separated
by a nanometric spacer, the hybridized antibonding SPP mode stays in the
visible range, while the bonding one can be pushed down to the mid-infrared

investigate experimental results in developing object detection neural networks

cost-sensitive loss and an additional slice-level loss based on a
lesion-to-slice mapping function, to manage the lesion- and slice-level costs,
respectively. Our experiments based on 290 clinical patients concludes that 1)
The lesion-level FNR was effectively reduced from 0.19 to 0.10 and the

non-relativistic LIPs with $\beta\gamma$ as small as 0.1 for the first time.

graph, with bits on the edges and parity-check constraints from the short codes
enforced at the vertices of the graph. Combining good short codes together with
a spectral expander graph yields the celebrated expander codes of Sipser and
Spielman, which are asymptotically good classical LDPC codes.
  In this work we apply this prescription to the left-right Cayley complex that
lies at the heart of the recent construction of a $c^3$ locally testable code
by Dinur et al. Specifically, we view this complex as two graphs that share the
same set of edges. By defining a Tanner code on each of those graphs we obtain
two classical codes that together define a quantum code. This construction can
be seen as a simplified variant of the Panteleev and Kalachev asymptotically
good quantum LDPC code, with improved estimates for its minimum distance. This
quantum code is closely related to the Dinur et al. code in more than one
sense: indeed, we prove a theorem that simultaneously gives a linearly growing
minimum distance for the quantum code and recovers the local testability of the
Dinur et al. code.

harmonic-oscillator (HO) potential acting upon one component, and an expulsive
anti-HO potential acting upon the other. The systems ca be implemented in
optical and BEC dual-core waveguides. In the 1D linear system, codimension-one
solutions are found in an exact form for the ground state (GS) and dipole mode
(the first excited state). Generic solutions are produced by means of the
variational approximation, and are found in a numerical form. Exact
codimension-one solutions and generic numerical ones are also obtained for the
GS and vortex states in the 2D system (the exact solutions are found for all
values of the vorticity). Both the trapped and anti-trapped components of the
bound states may be dominant ones, in terms of the norm. The localized modes
may be categorized as bound states in continuum, as they coexist with
delocalized ones. The 1D states, as well as the GS in 2D, are weakly affected
and remain stable if the self-attractive or repulsive nonlinearity is added to
the system. The self-attraction makes the vortex states unstable against
splitting, while they remain stable under the action of the self-repulsion.

transverse expansion, we use three different numerical methods to analyze the
emergence of attractor solutions in an ideal gas of massless particles
exhibiting constant shear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\eta / s$. The
fluid energy density is initialized using a Gaussian profile in the transverse
plane, while the ratio $\chi = \mathcal{P}_L / \mathcal{P}_T$ between the
longitudinal and transverse pressures is set at initial time $\tau_0$ to a
constant value $\chi_0$ throughout the system employing the
Romatschke-Strickland distribution. We introduce the hydrodynamization time
$\delta \tau_H = (\tau_H - \tau_0)/ \tau_0$ based on the time $\tau_H$ when the
standard deviation $\sigma(\chi)$ of a family of solutions with different
$\chi_0$ reaches a minimum value at the point of maximum convergence of the
solutions. In the $0+1{\rm D}$ setup, $\delta \tau_H$ exhibits scale
invariance, being a function only of $(\eta / s) / (\tau_0 T_0)$. With
transverse expansion, we find a similar $\delta \tau_H$ computed with respect
to the local initial temperature, $T_0(r)$. We highlight the transition between
the regimes where the longitudinal and transverse expansions dominate. We find
that the hydrodynamization time required for the attractor solution to be
reached increases with the distance from the origin, as expected based on the
properties of the $0+1{\rm D}$ system defined by the local initial conditions.
We argue that hydrodynamization is predominantly the effect of the longitudinal
expansion, being significantly influenced by the transverse dynamics only for
small systems or for large values of $\eta / s$.

We apply two independent full-spectral-fitting approaches, measuring a total
metallicity, [Z/H]=$-0.13\pm0.08$ with Bagpipes, and [Z/H]=$0.04\pm0.14$ with
Alf, a fall of $\sim0.2-0.3$ dex compared with the local Universe. We also
measure an iron abundance, [Fe/H] =$-0.18\pm0.08$, a fall of $\sim0.15$ dex
compared with the the local Universe. We measure the alpha enhancement via the
magnesium abundance, obtaining [Mg/Fe]=$0.23\pm$0.12, consistent with
similar-mass galaxies in the local Universe, indicating no evolution in the
average alpha enhancement of log$(M_*/\rm{M_\odot})=11$ quiescent galaxies over
the last $\sim8$ Gyr. This suggests the very high alpha enhancements recently
reported for several bright $z\sim1-2$ quiescent galaxies are due to their
extreme masses, log$(M_*/\rm{M_\odot})\gtrsim11.5$, rather than being typical
of the $z\gtrsim1$ population. The metallicity evolution we observe with
redshift (falling [Z/H], [Fe/H], constant [Mg/Fe]) is consistent with recent
studies. We recover a mean stellar age of $2.5^{+0.6}_{-0.4}$ Gyr,
corresponding to a formation redshift, $z_\rm{form}=2.4^{+0.6}_{-0.3}$. Recent
studies have obtained varying average formation redshifts for $z\gtrsim1$
massive quiescent galaxies, and, as these studies report consistent
metallicities, we identify different star-formation-history models as the most
likely cause. Larger spectroscopic samples from upcoming ground-based
instruments will provide precise constraints on ages and metallicities at
$z\gtrsim1$. Combining these with precise JWST $z>2$ quiescent-galaxy
stellar-mass functions will provide an independent test of formation redshifts

the classical scattering theory of plane longitudinal wave propagation in
untextured polycrystals with statistically equiaxed grains belonging to the
seven crystal symmetries. As revealed from the results of 10,390 materials, the
classical theory has a linear relationship with the elastic scattering factor
at the quasi-static velocity limit, whereas the reference FE and
self-consistent (SC) results generally exhibit a quadratic relationship. As
supported by the results of 90 materials, such order difference also extends to
the attenuation and phase velocity, leading to larger differences between the
classical theory and the FE results for more strongly scattering materials.
Alternatively, two approximate models are proposed to achieve more accurate
calculations by including an additional quadratic term. One model uses
quadratic coefficients from quasi-static SC velocity fits and is thus
symmetry-specific, while the other uses theoretically-determined coefficients
and is valid for any individual material. These simple models generally deliver
more accurate attenuation and phase velocity (particularly the second model)
than the classical theory, especially for strongly scattering materials.
However, the models are invalid for the attenuation of materials with negative
quadratic coefficients.

information, which is encoded in a hierarchal structure of short and long-term
contexts. However, the background noise distorts these structures in a
nonuniform way. The existing deep acoustic signal enhancement (ASE)
architectures ignore this kind of local and global effect. To address this
problem, we propose to integrate a novel temporal attentive-pooling (TAP)
mechanism into a conventional convolutional recurrent neural network, termed as
TAP-CRNN. The proposed approach considers both global and local attention for
ASE tasks. Specifically, we first utilize a convolutional layer to extract
local information of the acoustic signals and then a recurrent neural network
(RNN) architecture is used to characterize temporal contextual information.
Second, we exploit a novelattention mechanism to contextually process salient
regions of the noisy signals. The proposed ASE system is evaluated using a
benchmark infant cry dataset and compared with several well-known methods. It
is shown that the TAPCRNN can more effectively reduce noise components from
infant cry signals in unseen background noises at challenging signal-to-noise
levels.

through the linear uncoupled thermodynamic force-flux relations which guarantee
the non-negativity of the entropy production. However, the conventional
thermodynamic description is only valid when the Knudsen number is sufficiently
small. Here, it is shown that the range of validity of the
Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations can be extended by incorporating the nonlinear
coupling among the thermodynamic forces and fluxes. The resulting system of
conservation laws closed with the coupled constitutive relations is able to
describe many interesting rarefaction effects, such as Knudsen paradox,
transpiration flows, thermal stress, heat flux without temperature gradients,
etc., which can not be predicted by the classical Navier-Stokes-Fourier
equations. For this system of equations, a set of phenomenological boundary
conditions, which respect the second law of thermodynamics, is also derived.
Some of the benchmark problems in fluid mechanics are studied to show the
applicability of the derived equations and boundary conditions.

gas densities were higher and gas-rich mergers were common. They can also form
inside lower-mass galaxies that have since been accreted and tidally disrupted,
leaving their globular cluster complement bound to higher-mass halos. We argue
that the age-metallicity-specific orbital energy relation in a galaxy's
globular cluster system can be used to identify its origin. Gas-rich mergers
should produce tightly bound systems in which metal-rich clusters are younger
than metal-poor clusters. Globular clusters formed in massive disks and then
scattered into a halo should have no relationship between age and specific
orbital energy. Accreted globular clusters should produce weakly bound systems
in which age and metallicity are correlated with each other but inversely
correlated with specific orbital energy. We use precise relative ages,
self-consistent metallicities, and space-based proper motion-informed orbits to
show that the Milky Way's metal-poor globular cluster system lies in a plane in
age-metallicity-specific orbital energy space. We find that relatively young or
metal-poor globular clusters are weakly bound to the Milky Way, while
relatively old or metal-rich globular clusters are tightly bound to the Galaxy.
While metal-rich globular clusters may be formed either in situ or ex situ, our
results suggest that metal-poor clusters formed outside of the Milky Way in
now-disrupted dwarf galaxies. We predict that this relationship between age,
metallicity, and specific orbital energy in a $L^{*}$ galaxy's globular cluster
system is a natural outcome of galaxy formation in a $\Lambda$CDM universe.

circularly polarized emission from $\tau$ Bo\""{o}tis in the range 21-30 MHz

shows an excess in the ON-beam with respect to the two simultaneous OFF-beams.
Close examination casts some doubts on the reality of the slowly varying

detection. Furthermore, a $\sim$2$\sigma$ marginal signal is found from the
$\upsilon$ Andromedae system and no signal is detected from the 55 Cancri

origin. Their source probably is the $\tau$ Bootis planetary system, and a
possible explanation is radio emission from the exoplanet $\tau$ Bootis b via
the cyclotron maser mechanism. Assuming a planetary origin, we derived limits
for the planetary polar surface magnetic field strength, finding values
compatible with theoretical predictions. Further low-frequency observations are

neutrino mixing parameters. Starting in 2020, we show how measurements by JUNO,
DUNE, and Hyper-Kamiokande will affect our ability to determine the regions of
flavor composition at Earth that are allowed by neutrino oscillations under
different assumptions of the flavor composition that is emitted by the
astrophysical sources. From 2020 to 2040, the error on inferring the flavor
composition at the source will improve from $> 40\%$ to less than $6\%$. By
2040, under the assumption that pion decay is the principal production
mechanism of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, a sub-dominant mechanism
could be constrained to contribute less than 20\% of the flux at 99.7\%
credibility. These conclusions are robust in the nonstandard scenario where
neutrino mixing is non-unitary, a scenario that is the target of
next-generation experiments, in particular the IceCube-Upgrade. Finally, to
illustrate the improvement in using flavor composition to test

between an informed agent (the sender) and uninformed decision makers (the
receivers). The current rapidly-growing literature mostly assumes a dichotomy:
either the sender is powerful enough to communicate separately with each
receiver (a.k.a. private persuasion), or she cannot communicate separately at
all (a.k.a. public persuasion). We study a model that smoothly interpolates
between the two, by considering a natural multi-channel communication structure
in which each receiver observes a subset of the sender's communication
channels. This captures, e.g., receivers on a network, where information
spillover is almost inevitable.
  We completely characterize when one communication structure is better for the
sender than another, in the sense of yielding higher optimal expected utility
universally over all prior distributions and utility functions. The
characterization is based on a simple pairwise relation among receivers - one
receiver information-dominates another if he observes at least the same
channels. We prove that a communication structure $M_1$ is (weakly) better than
$M_2$ if and only if every information-dominating pair of receivers in $M_1$ is
also such in $M_2$. We also provide an additive FPTAS for the optimal sender's
signaling scheme when the number of states is constant and the graph of
information-dominating pairs is a directed forest. Finally, we prove that
finding an optimal signaling scheme under multi-channel persuasion is,
generally, computationally harder than under both public and private
persuasion.

learning approach for the prediction of solvation free energies that combines
fundamentals from quantum calculations with the higher accuracy of experimental
measurements. The employed model architecture is based on the directed-message
passing neural network for the molecular embedding of solvent and solute
molecules. A significant advantage of models pre-trained on quantum
calculations is demonstrated for small experimental datasets and for
out-of-sample predictions. The improved out-of-sample performance is shown for
new solvents, for new solute elements, and for the extension to higher molar
mass solutes. The overall performance of the pre-trained models is limited by
the noise in the experimental test data, known as the aleatoric uncertainty. On
a random test split, a mean absolute error of 0.21 kcal/mol is achieved. This
is a significant improvement compared to the mean absolute error of the quantum
calculations (0.40 kcal/mol). The error can be further reduced to 0.09 kcal/mol

controller and switches. We ran a variety of experiments to highlight quicSDN's
benefits, and compared experimental results with transport-layer overhead
prediction models. quicSDN's performance is evaluated in terms of network
overhead reduction and we also demonstrated quicSDN's connection migration
capabilities. First, we compare the differences in controller-switch
communication overhead between tcpSDN(SDN over TCP) and quicSDN. Overhead
reduction was measured in three scenarios: flow rule installation, queue
configuration, and flow rule statistics polling. Second, we compare the
connection migration of quicSDN and tcpSDN; QUIC's ability to quickly migrate
connections allows for reduced total traffic in comparison to TCP. Overall, our
results show that quicSDN outperformed tcpSDN in our SDN scenarios, and as
such, QUIC is a promising candidate as an SDN transport layer protocol in the
future.

depends on the measurement of myocardial shape indices, which is usually
achieved by manual contouring of the endo- and epicardial. However, this
process subjected to inter and intra-observer variability, and it is a
time-consuming and tedious task. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal
multi-task learning approach to obtain a complete set of measurements
quantifying cardiac LV morphology, regional-wall thickness (RWT), and
additionally detecting the cardiac phase cycle (systole and diastole) for a
given 3D Cine-magnetic resonance (MR) image sequence. We first segment cardiac
LVs using an encoder-decoder network and then introduce a multitask framework
to regress 11 LV indices and classify the cardiac phase, as parallel tasks
during model optimization. The proposed deep learning model is based on the 3D
spatio-temporal convolutions, which extract spatial and temporal features from
MR images. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method using cine-MR
sequences of 145 subjects and comparing the performance with other
state-of-the-art quantification methods. The proposed method obtained high

in vulnerability to guessing attacks. System-assigned authentication keys can

maximize the sum UL-DL spectral efficiency (SE). We theoretically establish the
sub-modularity of the sum SE, which allows us to develop a new, low complexity,
greedy algorithm for the combinatorial AP scheduling problem, with guaranteed
optimality properties. We also consider pilot sequence reuse among the UEs to
limit the channel estimation overhead. In CF systems, all the APs estimate the
channel from every UE, making pilot allocation problem different from the
cellular case. We develop a novel algorithm that iteratively minimizes the
maximum pilot contamination across the UEs. We compare our solutions, both
theoretically and via simulations, against a full duplex (FD) multi-cell mMIMO

critical role in almost all fields of scientific research and engineering.
These computer experiments, or simulators, are often computationally expensive,
leading to the use of emulators for rapidly approximating the outcome of the
experiment. Gaussian process models, also known as Kriging, are the most common
choice of emulator. While emulators offer significant improvements in
computation over computer simulators, they require a selection of inputs along
with the corresponding outputs of the computer experiment to function well.
Thus, it is important to select inputs judiciously for the full computer
simulation to construct an accurate emulator. Space-filling designs are
efficient when the general response surface of the outcome is unknown, and thus
they are a popular choice when selecting simulator inputs for building an

orbital motion in this previously unexplored scheme is at least two orders of
magnitude higher than values attainable with conventional trapping. Under our
experimental conditions, silica micro-spheres orbit up to a maximum frequency
of ~2 kHz at atmospheric pressure, which can be further increased by increasing
the optical power in the trap. With the help of simulations, we discuss how the

across different camera views. Training a convolutional neural network (CNN)
for this task requires annotating a large dataset, and hence, it involves the
time-consuming manual matching of people across cameras. To reduce the need for
labeled data, we focus on a semi-supervised approach that requires only a
subset of the training data to be labeled. We conduct a comprehensive survey in
the area of person re-identification with limited labels. Existing works in
this realm are limited in the sense that they utilize features from multiple
CNNs and require the number of identities in the unlabeled data to be known. To
overcome these limitations, we propose to employ part-based features from a
single CNN without requiring the knowledge of the label space (i.e., the number
of identities). This makes our approach more suitable for practical scenarios,
and it significantly reduces the need for computational resources. We also
propose a PartMixUp loss that improves the discriminative ability of learned
part-based features for pseudo-labeling in semi-supervised settings. Our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art results on three large-scale person re-id
datasets and achieves the same level of performance as fully supervised methods
with only one-third of labeled identities.

enables the accurate determination of the absolute-scale electronic energetics

upon solute addition, and depends on the solute concentration. We discuss two
prototypical aqueous salt solutions, NaI(aq) and tetrabutylammonium iodide,
TBAI(aq), with the latter being a strong surfactant. Considerably different
behavior is revealed: In the NaI(aq) solutions, water's 1b1 energy increases by
300 meV upon increasing the concentration near-saturation concentrations,
whereas for TBAI the energy decreases by about 0.7 eV upon formation of a
surface layer. The solute-induced effects on the solute binding energies are
quantified as well, as inferred from concentration-dependent energy shifts of
the I- 5p peak energy. For NaI(aq), an almost identical I- 5p shift is found as
for the water 1b1 binding energy, with a larger shift occurring in the opposite
direction for the TBAI(aq) solution. We show that this result in NaI(aq) can be
primarily assigned to a change of water's electronic structure in the solution
bulk. In contrast, apparent changes of the 1b1 energy for TBAI(aq) can be
related to changes of the solution work function which could arise from surface
molecular dipoles. Furthermore, for both of the solutions studied here, the
measured water 1b1 binding energies can be correlated with the extensive
solution molecular structure changes occurring at high salt concentrations,
where in the case of NaI(aq), too few water molecules exist to hydrate
individual ions and the solution adopts a crystalline-like phase. We also
comment on the concentration-dependent shape of the 3a1 orbital of liquid water
which is a sensitive signature of water-water hydrogen bond interactions.

from the very faint transient neutron star low-mass X-ray binary GRS
1741.9-2853 during a period of outburst in May 2020. We show that the
persistent emission can be modeled as an absorbed, Comptonized blackbody in
addition to Fe K$\alpha$ emission which can be attributed to relativistic disk
reflection. We measure a persistent bolometric, unabsorbed luminosity of
$L_{\mathrm{bol}}=7.03^{+0.04}_{-0.05}\times10^{36}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$,
assuming a distance of 7 kpc, corresponding to an Eddington ratio of $4.5\%$.
This persistent luminosity combined with light curve analysis leads us to infer
that the bursts were the result of pure He burning rather than mixed H/He
burning. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals that the bolometric flux of the
first burst exhibits a double-peaked structure, placing the source within a
small population of accreting neutron stars which exhibit multiple-peaked
type-I X-ray bursts. We find that the second, brighter burst shows evidence for
photospheric radius expansion (PRE) and that at its peak, this PRE event had an
unabsorbed bolometric flux of
$F_{\mathrm{peak}}=2.94^{+0.28}_{-0.26}\times10^{-8}\,\mathrm{erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$.
This yields a new distance estimate of $d=9.0\pm0.5$ kpc, assuming that this
corresponds to the Eddington limit for pure He burning on the surface of a
canonical neutron star. Additionally, we performed a detailed timing analysis
which failed to find evidence for quasiperiodic oscillations or burst
oscillations, and we place an upper limit of $16\%$ on the rms variability

is of particular importance in data science and machine learning. An endeavor
during the past 16 years viewing causality as real physical notion so as to
formulate it from first principles, however, seems to go unnoticed. This study
introduces to the community this line of work, with a long-due generalization
of the information flow-based bivariate time series causal inference to
multivariate series, based on the recent advance in theoretical development.
The resulting formula is transparent, and can be implemented as a
computationally very efficient algorithm for application. It can be normalized,
and tested for statistical significance. Different from the previous work along
this line where only information flows are estimated, here an algorithm is also
implemented to quantify the influence of a unit to itself. While this forms a
challenge in some causal inferences, here it comes naturally, and hence the
identification of self-loops in a causal graph is fulfilled automatically as
the causalities along edges are inferred.
  To demonstrate the power of the approach, presented here are two applications
in extreme situations. The first is a network of multivariate processes buried
in heavy noises (with the noise-to-signal ratio exceeding 100), and the second
a network with nearly synchronized chaotic oscillators. In both graphs,
confounding processes exist. While it seems to be a huge challenge to
reconstruct from given series these causal graphs, an easy application of the
algorithm immediately reveals the desideratum. Particularly, the confounding
processes have been accurately differentiated. Considering the surge of
interest in the community, this study is very timely.

statistically independent point sources separated by a distance below the width
of the point spread function (PSF). Almost twenty years ago it was shown that
the distance between two point sources can be statistically estimated with an
accuracy better than the PSF width. However, the estimation error increases
with decreasing distance. This effect was informally named Rayleigh's curse.
Next, it was demonstrated that PSF shaping allows breaking the curse provided
that all other source parameters except for the distance, are known a priori.
In this work, we propose a new imaging technique based on the target Beam
moduLation and the Examination of Shot Statistics (BLESS). Using the Fisher
information approach, we show that the technique can break Rayleigh's curse
even for unbalanced point sources with unknown centroid and intensity ratio.

analysis is performed of the star formation rate (SFR), oxygen abundance (O/H),
and nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratio (N/O) of the SQ regions, to explore the
provenance and evolution of this complex structure. According to the BPT
diagram, we found 91 HII, 17 composite, and 7 active galactic nucleus-like
regions in SQ. Several regions are compatible with fast shocks models without a
precursor for solar metallicity and low density (n=0.1 cm$^{-3}$), with
velocities between 175 - 300 km s$^{-1}$. We derived the total SFR in SQ
(log(SFR/M$_\odot\,yr^{-1}$=0.496); starburst A and B provide 28% and 9% of the
total SFR, and 45% comes from the regions with a radial velocity lower than
6160 km s$^{-1}$. For this reason, we assume that the material prior to the
collision with the new intruder (NI) does not show a high SFR, and therefore SQ
was apparently quenched. When considering the integrated SFR for the whole SQ
and the NI, we found that both zones have a SFR consistent with those obtained
in the SDSS star-forming galaxies. At least two chemically different gas
components cohabit in SQ where, on average, the regions with high radial
velocities (v$>$6160 km s$^{-1}$) have lower values of O/H and N/O than those
with low radial velocities (v$\leq$6160 km s$^{-1}$). The values found for the
line ratios, O/H, and N/O for the southern debris region and the northernmost
tidal tail, are compatible with regions belonging to the outer part of the
galaxies. We highlight the presence of inner-outer variation for O/H and some
emission line ratios along the NI strands and the young tidal tail south
strand. Finally, the SQ H$\alpha$ regions are outside the galaxies because the

  Active Surgical Robots in Hospitals",,,,,cs.RO,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  In recent years, surgical robots have become instrumental tools for assisting
surgeons in performing complex surgical procedures in hospitals. Unlike
conventional surgical methods, robotic systems help surgeons, for example, to
perform minimally invasive surgical procedures while enhancing the precision
and control of operations (e.g. tiny incisions, wound sutures, endoscopic
suturing, among others). To this extent, it is essential to consider several
factors that may influence the feasibility and decision making of employing
robotic systems in surgical procedures. In this paper, we propose an IoT-based
self-adaptive approach that uses multi-criteria decision analysis methods
(MCDA) for enhancing the decision making of operations involving surgical
robots. Throughout this paper, we present experimental validation results in
utilizing MCDA as an effective strategy for enhancing the decisions of
employing robotic systems in surgical procedures.

  Attention Model",,"in 24th Computer Vision Winter Workshop (CVWW), 2019, pp. 4-13",10.3217/978-3-85125-652-9,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Pedestrian trajectory prediction is essential for collision avoidance in
autonomous driving and robot navigation. However, predicting a pedestrian's
trajectory in crowded environments is non-trivial as it is influenced by other
pedestrians' motion and static structures that are present in the scene. Such
human-human and human-space interactions lead to non-linearities in the
trajectories. In this paper, we present a new spatio-temporal graph based Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for predicting pedestrian trajectory in
crowded environments, which takes into account the interaction with static
(physical objects) and dynamic (other pedestrians) elements in the scene. Our
results are based on two widely-used datasets to demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in human trajectory
prediction. In particular, our method leads to a reduction in Average
Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE) of up to 55% and
61% respectively over state-of-the-art approaches.

  and Instance Segmentation",,,,,cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  This paper presents a generic feature-based navigation framework for
autonomous vehicles using a soft constrained Particle Filter. Selected map
features, such as road and landmark locations, and vehicle states are used for
designing soft constraints. After obtaining features of mapped landmarks in
instance-based segmented images acquired from a monocular camera,
vehicle-to-landmark distances are predicted using Gaussian Process Regression
(GPR) models in a mixture of experts approach. Both mean and variance outputs
of GPR models are used for implementing adaptive constraints. Experimental
results confirm that the use of image segmentation features improves the
vehicle-to-landmark distance prediction notably, and that the proposed soft
constrained approach reliably localizes the vehicle even with reduced number of
landmarks and noisy observations.

  magnetic tunnel junctions with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy",,,10.1063/5.0073902,,cond-mat.mes-hall physics.app-ph,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Spintronic rf detectors were demonstrated, recently, for energy harvesting
and wireless communication at low input power. Here we report on the
optimization of the rectified output dc voltage using magnetic tunnel junctions
(MTJ) with strong perpendicular anisotropy (PMA) of both the polarizing and the
free layer. The magnetization of the polarizing layer is fixed out of plane,
while the free layer thickness is adjusted so that its magnetization
orientation changes from in plane to out of plane. The rectification dc output
voltage lies in the mV range for moderate rf powers, with a signal to noise
ratio of 10 to 100 for Prf = -25dBm. It shows a strong dependence on the
dimensions of the MTJ: it increases by a factor of 5 to 6 when reducing the
diameter from 150nm to 20nm. This enhancement can be doubled when reducing the
FL thickness from 1.8nm to 1.6nm. This dimensional enhancement is attributed to
the change of the effective anisotropy of the excited free layer, and the MTJ
resistance. The results are of interest for the design of spintronic based rf
detectors with optimized sensitivity.

  Analysis",,,,,cs.LG cs.CV cs.NE,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We show that Contrastive Learning (CL) under a family of loss functions
(including InfoNCE) has a game-theoretical formulation, where the \emph{max
player} finds representation to maximize contrastiveness, and the \emph{min
player} puts weights on pairs of samples with similar representation. We show
that the max player who does \emph{representation learning} reduces to
Principal Component Analysis for deep linear network, and almost all local
minima are global, recovering optimal PCA solutions. Experiments show that the
formulation yields comparable (or better) performance on CIFAR10 and STL-10
when extending beyond InfoNCE, yielding novel contrastive losses. Furthermore,
we extend our theoretical analysis to 2-layer ReLU networks, showing its
difference from linear ones, and proving that feature composition is preferred
over picking single dominant feature under strong augmentation.
