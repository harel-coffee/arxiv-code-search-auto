For these experiments, the proposed compression method was deployed on each dimension and the performance metrics are averaged over all the dimensions. In this regard, Dataset 2 ( comprising of three medical images and the color version of lena.jpg image) was used to benchmark ZT-based algorithm with those of DCT and FWHT. It can be observed in Figs. 11a and 12a that ZT-based transform have competitive performance on Scan1 data for block sizes 4 128, performance of ZT-based 8, 32 algorithm plummeted in comparison with DCT and FWHT-based approaches. Experimentation with Scan2 image shows that ZT consistently compresses the MRI data better and faster than its counterpart for most of the block sizes considered as shown in Figs. 11b and 12b. With block size of 128 128, the performance of FWHT improves and became comparable with ZT. Better performance in compression and speed of implementation is again observed on the average for ZT-based method using the Scan3 image, and the performance is more pronounced when the block size is 128 128 as shown in Figs. 11c and 12c. Again the proposed algorithm using color version of Lena image was compared with those of DCT and FWHT.

IV v2 (developed by Jacob Hoyos, Matthew Dale, and Noah Carter) goes a step further by not only displaying the GUI but also acting as a server and relaying the SPaT data to a single speciﬁed client machine over a local network. In IV v2, said client then displays the GUI based on the received SPaT data. The intended use of these applications was to serve as a learning experience and a prototype for the application described in section 3 of this report, IV v3.

There have been quite a few researches attempting to generate data processing results by directly linking records in the tables to the semantic meaning of the natural language input, such as [6] and [7]. However, these attempts are not scalable to big tables and are not reusable when the database schema is changed. More recent approaches use only the natural language input and the database schema and metadata to generate the queries. We review the most recent approaches in our research. Furthermore, the release of large annotated datasets containing questions and the corresponding database queries has additionally enhanced the ability to use deep learning or supervised techniques to tackle this problem. This has enabled the problem to evolve into a more complex task where the approaches should be domain independent and involving multiple tables with complex queries."

Each tool was employed in two ways: (i) the turn method, which annotates a single turn, irrespective of the conversation history, and (ii) the history method, which annotates each turn given the conversation history up to that turn. For the CAsT dataset, only user utterances were given to the EL tool, while for other datasets both system and user utterances were considered as conversation history. This is due to relatively long system utterances in the CAsT dataset, which makes infeasible for the EL tools to annotate the whole conversation history.

Figure 6 displays an example from the test set, which shows the gold standard images and the DL reconstructions for data undersampled with R = 4. Generally the visual quality of all the images (both gold standard and reconstructed ones) reduces with increased JPEG compression level (left-to-right in Figure 6); this is expected from compressed data. However, the NRMSE metric shows an unexpected effect: it improves with the compression, i.e. the reconstruction error reduces although the image visual quality degrades. The reason for this phenomenon is that in retrospective experiments the reconstruction quality is measured w.r.t. to a ""gold standard"" image that is also processed (see the pipeline in Figure 1c); the error metric is therefore blind to data processing. Strikingly, the NRMSE could show a misleading improvement even when the human eye cannot see any difference, as demonstrated in the left two columns of Figure 6: although the reconstructions from NC and QF = 75 are visually similar, the NRMSE of the latter is lower by 30%.

Accurate estimations were achieved for the LP steam ﬂow (maximum difference: 0.21 kg/s), the pressure between the HP and LP turbines (maximum difference: 0.12 bar) and the temperatures (maximum difference: 6.2 ◦C). This indicated that the assumption of zero service steam production might not be correct for Dataset 2. By taking out saturated service steam from the HP steam drum, the mass ﬂow rate to the HP turbine would drop. As a consequence, the HP steam pressure would drop according to the Stodola constant calculated for the HP turbine; see Equation (6).

The data were measured during the sea trials. The data contain measurements from three different days collected during a time period of 10–15 min. The values used in the validation were averaged over these time intervals for each of the three days. All three datasets contain measurements at 90%, 75% and 50% main engine load, while Dataset 1 contains an additional measurement at 40% main engine load.

In Figure 4a are compared estimated and measured values of the electric power generated in the steam turbine generator for Dataset 1. An exact match between the model and the measured data was obtained at 90% main engine load, since this point was selected as the design point for the SRC model validation. At 75%, 50% and 40% main engine load, the model estimations were within 2.3%, 2.4% and 11.9% of the measured values, respectively. The larger deviation at 40% main engine load could be due to the zero ﬂow of LP steam to the turbine at this load point, which might result in inaccuracies in the turbine efﬁciency function in Equation (5). The maximum relative deviations for the HP and LP mass ﬂow rates (see Figure 4b) were below 4% and 15%, respectively.

This data point was then used in the design model to deﬁne the design of the SRC unit. Values for the temperature of the exhaust gases and scavenge air were used directly from the dataset along with HP and LP boiler pressures and mass ﬂow rates and the intermediate pressure (IP) between the HP and LP turbines. The exhaust gas mass ﬂow rate was calculated based on ﬂow characteristic curves for the turbochargers and power turbine. The scavenge air mass ﬂow rate was assumed to be equal to that of the exhaust gases, neglecting the mass ﬂow rate of fuel, which is <5% of the exhaust gas mass ﬂow rate. The approach temperature difference of the HP and LP drums was extracted based on the measured drum feed temperatures and pressures. Similarly, the degree of superheating was extracted from the measured HP steam (HP turbine inlet) temperature and pressure. It was assumed that the HP and LP turbines have the same isentropic efﬁciency. The isentropic efﬁciency of the turbines were tuned in order to match the estimated steam turbine generator output (ηg · ˙Wt) with the measured value.

Downhole data can improve results of history-matching, but needs additional investments due to the need for expensive tools and the operational difﬁculties encountered. Nevertheless, to identify each fracture property in unconventional reservoirs with multi-stage fracturing, it is essential to allocate the total production rate to each fracture based on downhole measurements. A PLT is an effective tool when investments have not been made in permanent downhole tools.

The number of hours with haze increased continuously from 0 to 766 h a year between 1990 and 2007 while the consumption of primary energy (including oil products, natural gas, and aviation kerosene) had increased by 130 percent. Multiple regression analyses have shown that gas oil/diesel, fuel oil, and natural gas consumed locally and the burning of aviation kerosene were signiﬁcantly associated with the number of hours per year with haze in Macao. A correlation analysis between monthly haze data and monthly records of meteorological variables has indicated that the number of hours with haze was strongly, signiﬁcantly associated with high atmospheric pressure that leads to the lower mixed layer height in the past decade. The combustion of oil products produces particulate matter, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds including non-methane hydrocarbons. All of these air pollutants are well-known sources of haze. Besides, around 150 commercial aircrafts, which emit a signiﬁcant amount of particulate matter in low troposphere, take off and land at the Macao International Airport each day [32]. It is possible that there is a signiﬁcant correlation between the number of humid hours (the hours with a relative humidity between 75 and 80 percent) each year/month and the number of haze hours per year/month.

Secondary Substation Studied The study proposed does not make sense when demand is constant, since in that case there are always a number of connected transformers that optimizes efficiency. Analogously, it also makes no sense if the Sec SS has a single transformer, since in that case there is only one connection option. Therefore, this type of study offers greater possibilities of energy saving with: (1) more variations, both daily and seasonal, in the demand of the Sec SS; and (2) a greater number of transformers that can enter into service. In the studied hospital complex, this occurs in the Sec SS 3. The magnitude of the changes in demand is basically based on the fact that this Sec SS is connected to the central air conditioning services of the hospital, which implies that there are large variations in both hourly and seasonal demand. The variation in hourly demand is also associated with the fact that this Sec SS also provides the consumption of the hot water pumping service of the hospital, and lighting, elevators, medical equipment, etc. of nearby buildings. The differences of hourly consumption, in a same day, can cause that the demand in the hour of greater consumption multiplies by 2.5 the demand of the hour of lower consumption. Regarding the differences in monthly consumption, the demand corresponding to the month of greatest consumption reaches 175% of the energy supplied in the month of least consumption. Analyzing the demand of the Sec SS 3, it has been observed that there is a great difference in the demand between the one that takes place in working days and the one on holidays."

Analyzing the demand of the Sec SS 3, it has been observed that there is a great difference in the demand between the one that takes place in working days and the one on holidays. This is basically due to the existence of consultations and diagnostic services in the hospital, which only operate on weekdays and therefore do not require space heating or air conditioning (supplied from Sec SS 3).

Moreover, by proposing different and effective anomaly detection methods, some studies have used the taxi dataset to detect anomalous trafﬁc events, which occur when the corresponding indicators deviate signiﬁcantly from the expected values [11], and to detect anomalous routes such as fraudulent taxi travel patterns or trafﬁc accidents, as well as identifying the parts of the trajectories responsible for the anomalies and ranking them with an ongoing anomaly score [12].

This represents less than two percent of the worldwide electricity demand, but when compared to the ambition of China alone, of 1300 GW of solar capacity by the year of 2055 [2], illustrates what is yet to come for PV energy systems. However, the increased penetration of solar energy brings new challenges for grid operators, one of which concerns the short-term variability of solar irradiance [3]. This causes high variations in the injected power that can cause serious grid stability issues. To mitigate this problem, power ramp-rate limitation measures have been included in the electrical grid codes of many countries [4]. Generally, these RR limitations are deﬁned on a second or minute time frame or even in both. In addition, the maximum allowable RR can be deﬁned as a percentage of the plant capacity or as a deﬁned set of power. Some examples are the grid code of Ireland (EirGrid), which states a positive ramp up to 30 MW/minute and Hawaii (HECO), ± 2 MW/minute [5]. For Germany [6] and Puerto Rico (PREPA) [5], a maximum ramp-rate of 10%/minute of the rated PV power is considered. Other grid codes also quantify the maximum allowable ramp-rate in the order of seconds. For example, in Denmark [7], a maximum power ramp-rate of 100 kW/s is required."

The conﬁgurations of the methods are based on Technical Regulation 3.2.1 (TR 3.2.1) and Technical Regulation 3.2.2 (TR 3.2.2), the Danish grid code for power plants up to and including 11 kW and PV power plants above 11 kW, respectively. The demonstration of the methods is shown in Figure 2 [34,35]. The PV inverters usually operate with two types of PF, i.e., lagging and leading PF. From the generator convention, they are deﬁned as"
10.3390_en12081458,code,188,2022-05-25,0,"Diﬀerent reactive power control methods have diﬀerent eﬀects on these problems. With the PF(P) control, the power loss and the overload problem in the transformers are the lowest among all the three cases. From this aspect, the PF(P) control shows the best performance in all three case studies. With the constant PF control, the lowest power loss of the entire grid occurs if the PV systems operate with a PF of 0.9 (leading), which is not required by the current Danish grid code for small scale residential PV plants, i.e., TR 3.2.1. Judging from the yearly average power loss condition, it can be beneﬁcial to operate PV systems with leading PF, especially in the grid with many cables. In terms of the worst overvoltage situation, constant PF control results in the lowest maximum bus voltage. With a constant Q control applied to large-scale PV power plants, the grid has the highest loss and experiences the most severe overvoltage problem among all three cases."

Solar photovoltaic (PV) plants play an important role in this process. This paper conducted a study to investigate the impacts of residential solar PV integration in the distribution grid on voltage security and grid loss based on the 10 kV distribution grid in Bornholm. Three case studies are performed to test three diﬀerent reactive power control methods, i.e., PF(P), constant PF and constant Q, at diﬀerent penetration levels. The assessment of the impacts of PV integration and diﬀerent control methods are done in the DIgSILENT PowerFactory. It was found that PV integration can contribute to reducing the loss of the system, increased overvoltage in buses and overload in transformers, and 40% penetration at the low voltage is considered to be an optimal level based on the result. PF(P) control gives the best performance among all three methods under the current grid codes. With constant PF control, it was found that the system loss can be signiﬁcantly reduced if the PV systems operate with a power factor of 0.9 leading, which is not the norm of the current Danish grid code."

In (17), each term has a corresponding weighting factor. In actual application, ﬁrstly, the selection of these weighting factors is through trial and error by simulation. Then, it could be implemented in the experiment and make adjustment accordingly. Finally, the selected weighting factors would be implemented in practical application. Each weighting factor value would have an inﬂuence on the weighting factor selection of the others, and the weighting factor values are in relation with system conﬁgurations, thus it is quite a complex task for the mathematical derivation and veriﬁcation about the calculation of each weighting factor, which is out of scope of the main target of this paper, it will be researched in the future work. By selecting proper weighting factors, good dynamic and steady-state performance can be balanced in a systematic way. It is obvious that the additional terms would increase the computational burden compared with the conventional methods due to more complex cost function, especially in less capable hardware system.

The MG-EMS performs optimization to minimize the total operation cost of the MG. The amount of buying/selling power is determined based on the amount of surplus/shortage power in the MG system, as shown in Figure 6a. The buying/selling power of the MG is traded with two external systems, i.e., CBESS and the utility grid. It can be observed from Figure 6b that the CBESS always decides to importpower from cheaper resources. During intervals 3, 4, 6, the generation cost of CDG is less than the buying prices from the utility grid. Therefore, CBESS decides to charge surplus power from MG instead ofbuying from the utility grid. Figure 6c shows the buying power ofthe MG system. The MG decides to import power from the external systems for minimizing the total operation cost. At intervals 2 and 5, MGimports power from the utility grid to fulfill load amount with cheaper price compared with 1201401601802004006008001471013161922kWhInterval (hour)LoadPrbuyPrsellwon/kWh05101520251357911131517192123kWhInterval (hour)PVWTEnergies 2019, 12, 1789"

Therefore, in this paper, we normalize GBDT with a subsample, which ranges from 0 to 1. This approach is called stochastic gradient boosting tree (SGBT) [46]. At each round of iteration, a subsample of training data is drawn at random from the full training dataset. The randomly selected subsample is then used, instead of the full sample, to ﬁt the base learner. In this way, the GBDT model can be partially paralleled, thereby reducing model overﬁtting to a certain extent."

Both GBDT and RF are ensemble learning methods and predict by combining the outputs from individual trees, yet on our dataset, GBDT proved to be more effective than RF. The reason is that, for data including categorical variables with different numbers of levels (e.g., the total length of the line ranges from hundreds to thousands), random forests are more biased in favor of those attributes with more levels, compared with GBDT. Therefore, the variable importance scores from random forest are not reliable for this type of data, hence the prediction accuracy of RF would be severely affected.

CART is a typical binary tree, its essence is to divide the feature space into two parts and split the scalar attribute and the continuous attribute [22–26]. The CART algorithm consists of the following two steps: (1) Generate decision tree. This is done via training data set, build nodes from top to bottom. In order to make the resulting child nodes as pure as possible, split each node according to the best attribute. For the classiﬁcation problem, use GINI value as the basis for splitting node; for the regression problem, use the smallest variance instead. (2) Pruning.

10.3390_en12132522,"dataset, data",194,2022-05-25,0,"Abstract: Line loss rate plays an essential role in evaluating the economic operation of power systems. However, in a low voltage (LV) distribution network, calculating line loss rate has become more cumbersome due to poor conﬁguration of the measuring and detecting device, the difﬁculty in collecting operational data, and the excessive number of components and nodes. Most previous studies mainly focused on the approaches to calculate or predict line loss rate, but rarely involve the evaluation of the prediction results. In this paper, we propose an approach based on a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), to predict line loss rate. GBDT inherits the advantages of both statistical models and AI approaches, and can identify the complex and nonlinear relationship while computing the relative importance among variables. An empirical study on a data set in a city demonstrates that our proposed approach performs well in predicting line loss rate, given a large number of unlabeled examples. Experiments and analysis also conﬁrmed the effectiveness of our proposed approach in anomaly detection and practical project management."

Therefore, the aim was to design and construct a georeferenced (mapping) database for mainland Portugal, to identify land availability for the implementation of energy crops and microalgae cultures, and to locate agricultural and forestry production areas (including their residues) with potential for sustainable exploitation for energy. The ArcGIS software was used as a Geographic Information System (GIS) tool, introducing the data corresponding to the type of soil, water needs and edaphoclimatic conditions in shapefile and raster data type, to assess the areas for the implantation of the biomass of interest. After analysing the data of interest in each map in ArcGIS, the intersection of all maps is presented, suggesting adequate areas and predicting biomass productions for the implementation of each culture in mainland Portugal. Under the conditions of the study, cardoon (72 kha, 1085 kt), paulownia (81 kha, 26 kt) and microalgae (29 kha, 1616 kt) presented the greater viability to be exploited as biomass to energy in degraded and marginal soils."

Alternatively, our strategy is to train a regression model to estimate social welfare and select the high-quality scenarios based on the estimated rather than actual social welfare values.

The obtained results demonstrate a substantial improvement by the installation of the green roof onthe building’s cooling energy demand for a standard summer day, in the order of 30%, and a reduction, about 15%, in the heating energy demand for a winter day. Thus, given the longer duration of the summer conditions along the year, a noticeable reduction on energy demand could be obtained. Simulation analysis, using commercial software TRNSYS code, previously calibrated using experimental data for typical summer and winter days, allows for the extrapolation to the entire year of these results deducing noticeable improvement in energy eﬃciency, in the order of 19%, but with an increase of 6% in the peak power during the winter period."

The average RMSE (and NRMS) for each case is presented in Table 1. The results obtained with the proposed method are systematically better than the most straightforward adaptation by sliding window, which means that implementing the method gives more reliable information to the prosumer than not doing so, even though the error reduction may be small. Other algorithms will occasionally perform better for adapting speciﬁc models. For example, the golden ratio method reduces the error when adapting the power generation model, but it is not suitable to adapt the thermal load model.

The former refers to the behind-the-meter resources [7], while the latter describes situations where the prosumer agent can interact with other agents and information services. In most cases, the external environment only collects data of either weather variables or their forecast, but in a decentralized management scheme, it is possible to consider the external environment as a multi-agent system (MAS) [8]. The agent is able to perceive the local environment by observing the power consumption data of different appliances. In fact, it constructs a time-series database by accumulating new information from a data stream [9]. However, this process is problematic since agents have limitations on memory and processing time [10]. In addition, the data stream can drift over time, thus causing previously trained data models of appliances to lose accuracy [11].

It is relevant to mention that the threshold to accept the results of the cross-validation depends on the nature of the target variable of each model [37]. The test data set will be the closest batch to future features. Now, to identify that batch, the distance will be measured as in the FISH method [34] as a combined distance in time and space of the samples. If the result of the cross-validation test is not good enough, then the model will be retrained only with the closest N batches. The parameter N needs to be tuned according to the model to avoid convergence problems in training but knowing that, when a concept drift appears, it is safer to train with a small amount of data to ensure that all samples correspond to the new concept.

According to the figures, when the initial capillary pressure increases and the non-wetting phase viscosity decreases, the corresponding imbibition rates increase. However, the final imbibition recovery factor tends to be similar, which is because the water imbibition process is a capillary-dominated flow and the recovery factor is controlled by capillarity, which is affected by pore shape, aspect ratio, contact angle, etc. Therefore, the viscous forces in the reservoir conditions increase the imbibition rates but not the final recovery factor. Figure 11. Spontaneous imbibition with different initial maximum capillary pressures. Figure 12. Spontaneous imbibition with different non-wetting phase viscosities. To further investigate the capillarity effect on the water imbibition of Barnett shale, the following sensitivity studies are conducted: the determination of the pore throat aspect ratio, contact angle and shape factor of the cross-area. The corresponding results for the water imbibition recovery factor with respect to dimensionless time are shown in Figures 13–15, respectively. A higher aspect ratio tends to increase the percentage of the non-wetting phase trapped by the snap-off effect, which increases the residual non-wetting phase saturation and hence the final recovery factor (c.f. Figure 13). When the contact angle and cross-area shape factor decrease, leading to an increase of capillary pressure, the imbibition rate increases at the beginning. However, the final recovery factor decreases slightly (c.f. Figures 13 and 14) because snap-off tends to occur more frequently with a lower contact angle and shape factor, as shown in Equation (13).

According to the figures, when the initial capillary pressure increases and the non-wetting phase viscosity decreases, the corresponding imbibition rates increase. However, the final imbibition recovery factor tends to be similar, which is because the water imbibition process is a capillary-dominated flow and the recovery factor is controlled by capillarity, which is affected by pore shape, aspect ratio, contact angle, etc. Therefore, the viscous forces in the reservoir conditions increase the imbibition rates but not the final recovery factor.

These models, in general, do not consider the impact of local terrain and atmospheric circulations. In this study, long-term ﬁve-year wind data at three sites on the North, East, and West of the Baltimore metropolitan area, Maryland, USA are statistically analyzed. The Weibull probability density function was deﬁned based on the observatory data. Despite seasonal and spatial variability in the wind resource, the annual mean wind speed for all sites is around 3 m/s, suggesting the region is not suitable for large-scale power generation. However, it does display a wind power capacity that might allow for non-grid connected small-scale wind turbine applications. Technical and economic performance evaluations of more than 150 conventional small-scale wind turbines showed that an annual capacity factor and electricity production of 11% and 1990 kWh, respectively, are achievable. It results in a payback period of 13 years. Government incentives can improve the economic feasibility and attractiveness of investments in small wind turbines. To reduce the payback period lower than 10 years, modern/unconventional wind harvesting technologies are found to be an appealing option in this region. Key contributions of this work are (1) highlighting the need for studying the urban physics rather than just the regional wind resource maps for wind development projects in the build-environment, (2) illustrating the implementation of this approach in a real case study of Maryland, and (3) utilizing techno-economic data to determine suitable wind harnessing solutions for the studied sites."

This information can be obtained by calculating the ratio between the ID and IG bands. The comparison of Raman spectra of electrodes with diﬀerent binders for LIBs and NIBs is shown in Figure S3, while the calculated ID /IG and La are presented in Table S1. As expected, all the Raman spectra present the same characteristic peaks −1 (G-band) [8], together with already observed for the powder at ~1345 cm −1, correlated to 2D and D+G bands [31]. Commonly, two broad peaks in the range of 2650–2950 cm the graphitization degree of hard carbon is bound to conductivity [23], while porosity and defects enable surface storage processes (thus relevant for NIBs) [33]. However, in the present case the data provide evidence, for all electrodes, of similar peak shapes and only small variations of the intensity ratio between D and G bands. This behavior may be attributed to only minor interactions of the active CGDHC and of the conductive additive with the functional groups. Therefore, we may exclude a relevant role of the binder in modifying structural or conduction properties of the active materials."

The prediction horizon is a time period where we have reasonably reliable information, ranging from a few hours to a couple of days. Using data available from the prediction horizon period, an optimization routine is solved and an optimal sequence of control moves is identiﬁed through the implementation of MPC. The identiﬁed schedules and control moves are applied to the building over a “control horizon”, which can be the same length or be shorter than the prediction horizon. Once the current control horizon has ended, the optimization exercise is performed again for the following prediction horizon. This process is repeated until the end of the simulation time (e.g., one day or one year). For the sake of simplicity, in this particular case, the prediction and control horizon are the same length of time and MPC was only initiated with a notiﬁcation signal: either 30 h for a 12-hour ahead notiﬁcation at 6 p.m. or 22 h for a 4-hour ahead notiﬁcation at 2 a.m. (for a DR event at 6 a.m.).

Linear changing of feeder loads is performed ranging from 0.5 (light load) to 1.6 (peak load) with a step size of value 0.01, where at each step, sizing is performed using CFT whose formulation is performed in the form of a simple quadrature equation. The present approach is supportive in the selection of a particular size of capacitor and DG based on distribution network operators (DNOs) and their load steps. The standard IEEE 33-bus test system and 69-bus benchmark test system are used to test the effectiveness and feasibility.

Such a large number of these variables makes it possible to describe the studied phenomena in a very accurate, and at the same time credible, manner. However, this often causes difﬁculties in interpretation. Therefore, in order to ﬁnd signiﬁcant relationships between the variables describing the research object, it is necessary to use methods reducing the dimension of the data space while maintaining as much of its variance as possible [53]. The PCA is one of such methods. It is a statistical measure in which a data set is reduced by creating a new space where the initial factors account for the most variability. The reduction of the number of dimensions is obtained by transforming variables into uncorrelated principal components, which are ordered in a descending manner by the size of the described variance of the community [54]:"

Other breakthrough solutions were proposed by the European Commission and presented at the UN COP25 climate summit in Madrid (Spain) [12]. They include a new, pioneering European climate strategy called the European Green Deal [13]. According to this strategy, the EU’s economy is to become a ""zero-emission"", i.e., climate-neutral economy by 2050. In turn, by 2030, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are to be reduced by 50% (plans assume even a 55% decrease) versus its emissions in 1990 [13]. These assumptions are more ambitious than those adopted at the UN climate summit COP24, which took place in 2018 in Katowice (Poland) [14]. Currently, the European Commission has announced that it will push for a higher target of reducing CO2 emissions by 2030 versus 1990. When compared to the previously adopted target, it will be raised from 40% to 55%. This target will enable an increase in the production and consumption of energy from RES. The latest main objectives of the EU’s energy policy until 2050 (the European Green Deal) are aimed at achieving a situation in which the EU economy becomes environmentally neutral.

Here, the contribution of RES to savings related to the import of fossil fuels in 2015 amounted to approximately EUR 15 billion. It is estimated that in 2030, it should be as much as EUR 58 billion [7]. This is due to the energy policy pursued by the EU. As early as in 2001, the EU adopted Directive 2001/77/EC [8], which requires each Member State to take appropriate measures to achieve a speciﬁc indicative target of RES-generated electricity. At that time, the target was to achieve renewable energy consumption at the level of 12% with an indicative 22% share of electricity produced from RES by 2010. The next measure was Directive 2003/30/EC [9], aimed at promoting the use of biofuels in transport and other renewable fuels (5.75% share of biofuels in transport fuel consumption). Pursuant to the next Directive 2009/28/EC [10], the EU countries were supposed to increase the share of energy obtained from RES in their total energy consumption. The European climate and energy package contained objectives that were to be achieved by 2020. These targets included a 20% reduction in EU greenhouse gas emissions below levels reported in 1990, increasing the share of energy produced from RES to 20% and improving energy efﬁciency by 20%.

In horizontal systems, to avoid interaction between the pipes, it is recommended that the pipes be spaced at least 1.5 m and buried at a depth of 1.2 m to 1.8 m [33]. There are clear advantages in using the earth-to-air heat exchangers in buildings located in hot climates during the summer season, already with short pipes, while in winter the beneﬁts of the system are just for few hours during the day. In the paper [34], it was investigated how geometric conﬁguration, soil thermal conductivity, heat transfer ﬂuid velocity, and installation depth affect the behavior of earthto-air heat exchangers, using CFD simulations. In addition, the paper [35] shows the impact of the unsaturated ground on the performance of the ground heat exchanger as the depth varies through numerical simulation. The results showed that the performance under unsaturated soil conditions decreased up to 40% compared to that under fully saturated ground conditions. In this regard, the study [36] has given a complete database on transient ground temperatures, which was acquired by surveying a case study located in southern Brazil.

10.3390_en9100838,dataset,230,2022-05-25,0,"As expected for the lower temperature processing conditions, the model CH4 molar prediction showed better conformity with the higher carbon conversion datasets D-1 and D-2 than that of D-3 and D-4. The predicted H2 concentration was clearly distorted by the CH4 favorable catalytic activity of ruthenium, a similar conclusion was found when model results were compared to the work of Haiduc et al. [43]. Another reason behind the model distortion compared to D-3 and D-4 was the detected molar composition of heavier hydrocarbons C+ in the experimental runs, which indicates incomplete conversion into the expected equilibria gases. A limited carbon gasiﬁcation rate was reported, as low as 45% in D-3, something that is expected at such lower temperature conditions and shorter residence times [6]. When analyzing D-3 and D-4, both cases with increased solid throughput, a condition needed to favor CH4 production, longer residence times that enable complete decomposition of solid organics into equilibrium gases is needed. To illustrate further, a look at the total carbon gas yields (not shown in the table), the model (~90% CGE) with a 0.29 g/gfeed compared favorable to D-1 (93% CGE) with 0.26 g/gfeed than D-3 (45% CGE) with 0.09 g/gfeed."

The model validation for H2 production across varied processing conditions was shown in our earlier publication [20]. Chakinala et al. [52] investigated the effect of catalyst nature on the product as shown in the variation of CGE and product gas composition within data sets D-5 to D-8. The higher reported CGE values lead to better conformity by the model data set-M. D-7 with excess loading of a ruthenium based catalysts 2 g/gfeed, recorded complete carbon partitioning into gas phase and had an almost identical representation of H2 and CH4 molar compositions to that of the model. The reported C+ (heavier hydrocarbon) composition, despite minimal compared to that of D-5, D-6 and D-8, showed that gas reforming equilibrium was still not achieved. Hydrocarbon reforming and gas phase reactions such as steam reforming and water gas shift activity are reported to take place after a much longer residence time than that reportedly set in the current experimental setup [4,5,7,11]. As such, it could be concluded that the modelling approach is capable of illustrating reasonably accurate predictions to the product gas nature as well as reactor yields from an algal slurry, for appropriate reactor setup conditions, that enable complete carbon conversion and gas formation equilibria. On a more conservative interpretation of the model ﬁndings, the thermo-chemical processing limit for chemical fuel production could be estimated. Similar approaches have been adapted in literature and were also validated with other available experimental data sets for a wide variety of biomass [31,35,36,46]."

10.3390_en9100838,package,189,2022-05-25,0,"The principal challenge to ensure the development of a reliable reactor or process model remains the computation of the speciﬁc thermodynamic properties of the highly asymmetric and multi-dimensional slurry mixtures. The parametrization of the SCWR phase equilibria interactions for the various processing components of solid and ﬂuid phases, polar and non-polar in nature, within super- and sub-critical conditions remains an area under development [41]. As such, predictive empirical equations of states (EOS) have garnered signiﬁcant attention over recent years for SCWG assessment studies. The advantage of empirical EOS in general compared to their activity coefﬁcient counterparts is the ability to predict phase equilibria at elevated pressures where inﬁnite dilution in a single phase is experienced [41]. Some of the EOS adapted in literature are the Peng-Robinson (PR) [24,26,28,31,32,35], Soave Redlich Kwong (SRK) [36,38], Duan [27,40], Statistical Association Fluids Theory (SAFT) [25], Virial EOS [30] and the original ideal package [33].

But we found that some bots would include interwiki links to their own language version for various reasons, to do work other than interwiki link cleanup, so we excluded interwiki links to the current language version."

The whole procedure repeated until all stars are not lying within the 3σ value of the said mean in both directions. The left members are used to determine the mean proper motion of individual cluster (as depicted in RA-DEC plane by blue dots in ﬁgure 3). The proper motions of stars of stellar sequences of OSCs are extracted from the PPMXL catalogue. After applying the CMRD approach, the number of extracted data-points are found to be 450, 285 and 1252 stars for ESO 65, 03, TEUTSCH 106 and TURNER 6 respectively. After applying the statistical cleaning approach, we are found 170, 178 and 422 members for the ESO 65 03, TEUTSCH 106 and TURNER 6 respectively. The iteration method of σ-clipping algorithm are provided the mean proper motion of 139, 171 and 395 members for ESO 65 03, TEUTSCH 106 and TURNER 6 respectively. The resultant values of mean proper motion are listed in table 3. These results are shown close agreement with the Kharchenko et. al. (2013). The corresponding mean proper values of clusters through UCAC4 catalog are also summarized in table 3. In addition, the mean proper motion for TURNER 6 (full Sky region of cluster) is found to be ¯µx = 0.71 in RA and DEC directions respectively.

Both tools are implemented mostly with web client languages, which allows their easy integration in other projects. The Audio Commons Manual Annotator (AC Manual Annotator) aims at adding missing labels, whereas the Audio Commons Reﬁnement Annotator (AC Reﬁnement Annotator) allows to reﬁne and specify existing labels. These tools can be useful not only to annotate during a post-precessing stage, like in Freesound Datasets, but also to provide annotations when a user publishes content in an online platform such as Freesound. Both of the tools focus on annotating a single sound resource at a time. The audio content is accessible from a player displaying the spectrogram of the sound, which can facilitate the localisation and recognition of sound events in the clip (Fig. 2 & 4) [13]."

Thus, NLP2API has a higher potential for query reformulation. Besides, opportunistic blending of pseudo-relevance feedback [69, 21], term weighting methods [19, 35], Borda count [84] and extra-large data analytics [17] also makes our work in this paper novel. Table 1 and Listing 1 present a use-case scenario of our technique where a developer is looking for a working code snippet that can convert a colour image to grayscale the developer issues a without generic query–“Convert image to grayscale without losing transparency”. Then she submits it to Lucene, a search engine that is widely used both by contemporary code search solutions such as GitHub native search [5] or ElasticSearch and by academic studies [31, 61, 54]. Unfortunately, the generic natural language query does not perform well due to vocabulary mismatch between its keywords and the source code, and returns the relevant code snippet (e.g., Listing 1) at the 115th position. On the contrary, (1) our proposed technique complements this query with not only relevant, but also highly speciﬁc API classes (e.g., BufferedImage, ColorConvertOp, ColorSpace), and (2) our improved query returns the target code snippet at the second position of the ranked list which is a major rank improvement over the baseline. The most recent and closely related technique–QECK [55] returns the same code snippet at the 11th position which is not ideal. Google, the most popular web search engine, returns a similar code at the second position as well."

1807.08798,"code, github",174,,0,"From Table VI, we see that the re-ranking approach that leverages our reformulated queries improves the initial search results returned by each of the engines. In particular, the performances are improved in terms of precision and discounted cumulative gain. For example, Google returns search results with 66% precision and 0.47 NDCG when Top-10 results are considered. Our approach, NLP2APIGoogle, improves the ranking and achieves a MAP@10 of 77% and a NDCG@10 of 0.61 which are 17% and 30% higher respectively. That is, although Google performs high as a general purpose web search engine, it might always not be precise for code search due to the lack of appropriate contexts. Our approach incorporates context into the search using relevant API names, and delivers more precise code search results.

Here, a ﬁnite volume-based staggered grid approach [31] is employed which prevents spurious pressure-velocity decoupling without the need for additional stabilization [32]. This implies that the pressure degrees of freedom are located on the cell centers while the velocity components live on the cell faces. DuMux is chosen because it provides extensive coupling capabilities which are required for the hybrid-dimensional model described in the next section. Besides the Dune core modules, dune-subgrid was used in order to create the grid. As the implemented free-ﬂow model also supports Navier-Stokes ﬂow (which is not considered in this work), Newton’s method is chosen by default to solve the potentially non-linear system of equations.

Besides, opportunistic blending of pseudo-relevance feedback [69, 21], term weighting methods [19, 35], Borda count [84] and extra-large data analytics [17] also makes our work in this paper novel. Table 1 and Listing 1 present a use-case scenario of our technique where a developer is looking for a working code snippet that can convert a colour image to grayscale the developer issues a without generic query–“Convert image to grayscale without losing transparency”. Then she submits it to Lucene, a search engine that is widely used both by contemporary code search solutions such as GitHub native search [5] or ElasticSearch and by academic studies [31, 61, 54]. Unfortunately, the generic natural language query does not perform well due to vocabulary mismatch between its keywords and the source code, and returns the relevant code snippet (e.g., Listing 1) at the 115th position. On the contrary, (1) our proposed technique complements this query with not only relevant, but also highly speciﬁc API classes (e.g., BufferedImage, ColorConvertOp, ColorSpace), and (2) our improved query returns the target code snippet at the second position of the ranked list which is a major rank improvement over the baseline. The most recent and closely related technique–QECK [55] returns the same code snippet at the 11th position which is not ideal. Google, the most popular web search engine, returns a similar code at the second position as well. However, in the case of web search, relevant code snippets are sporadic and often buried into a large bulk of unstructured, noisy and redundant natural language texts across multiple web pages which might overwhelm the developer with information overload [50]."

To do so, we first collected the curricula of all applicants to the five sessions of the ASN 2016, which have been made publicly available on the ANVUR website for a short period of time. We collected 518 CVs for level I (full professor) and 757 CVs for level II (associate professor). Note that each CV correspond to a single application, and that the same applicant may apply multiple times (i.e. in more than one session) for multiple levels. The next step consisted in collecting the list of the DOIs of all the publications that each candidate specified in her/his CV, thus excluding all the publications that do not have associated a DOI. This lead us to miss some publications, for instance the workshop articles in the CEUR-WS volumes which are published without a DOI (though Scopus takes track of them). However, we expect that the loss in term of citations is rather limited, considering that the most relevant works and their extensions usually go to journal articles and conference proceedings papers, which are instead associated with a DOI.

The idea is to automatically infer this task relationship in the RKHS space corresponding to the given base kernels. The problem is formulated as a regularization-based approach called MultiTask Multiple Kernel Relationship Learning (MK-MTRL), which models the task relationship matrix from the weights learned from latent feature spaces of task-speciﬁc base kernels. Unlike in previous work, the proposed formulation allows one to incorporate prior knowledge for simultaneously learning several related task. We propose an alternating minimization algorithm to learn the model parameters, kernel weights and task relationship matrix. In order to tackle large-scale problems, we further propose a two-stage MKMTRL online learning algorithm and show that it significantly reduces the computational time, and also achieves performance comparable to that of the joint learning framework. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed formulations outperform several state-ofthe-art multitask learning methods."

1905.03184,"code, data",305,,2,"ABSTRACT Message logging protocols are enablers of local rollback, a more efficient alternative to global rollback, for fault tolerant MPI applications. Until now, message logging MPI implementations have incurred the overheads of a redesign and redeployment of an MPI library, as well as continued performance penalties across various kernels. Successful research efforts for message logging implementations do exist, but not a single one of them can be easily deployed today by more than a few experts. In contrast, in this work we build efficient message logging capabilities on top of an MPI library with no message logging capabilities; we do so for two different HPC kernels, one with a global exchange pattern (CG), and one with a neighbourhood exchange pattern (LULESH). While our library of choice ULFM detects failure and recovers MPI communicators, we build on that to then restore the intra- and inter-process data consistency of both applications. This task turns out to be challenging, and we present the methodology for doing so in this work. In the end, we achieve message logging capabilities for each kernel, without the need for an actual message logging runtime underneath. On the performance side, we match state-of-the-art solutions and (a) eliminate event logging and the event logger component altogether, and (b) design a hybrid protocol, which gracefully shifts between global and local rollback, depending on the available payload logging memory. Such a hybrid protocol between local and global rollback has not been previously proposed to our knowledge. Our extensions span a few hundred lines of code for each kernel, are open-sourced, and enable local and global rollback after process failure."

The question title (e.g., “How do I decompress a GZip ﬁle in Java?” [11]) generally comprises of a few important keywords and often resembles a real life search query. We thus use these titles from tutorial sites as code search queries in our experiments, as were also used by the earlier studies [64, 22]. Ground Truth Preparation: The prose that explains code in the tutorial sites above often includes one or more API classes from the code (e.g., GZipInputStream, FileOutputStream).

We consider the compression of integer keys in a B+-tree index. For this purpose, systems such as IBM DB2 use variable-byte compression over diﬀerentially coded keys. We revisit this problem with various compression alternatives such as Google’s VarIntGB, Binary Packing and Frame-of-Reference. In all cases, we describe algorithms that can operate directly on compressed data. Many of our alternatives exploit the single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) instructions supported by modern CPUs. We evaluate our techniques in a database environment provided by Upscaledb, a production-quality key-value database. Our best techniques are SIMD accelerated: they simultaneously reduce memory usage while improving single-threaded speeds. In particular, a diﬀerentially coded SIMD binarypacking techniques (BP128) can oﬀer a superior query speed (e.g., 40 % better than an uncompressed database) while providing the best compression (e.g., by a factor of ten). For analytic workloads, our fast compression techniques oﬀer compelling beneﬁts. Our software is available as open source."

Such queries often do not lead to any relevant results due to vocabulary mismatch problems. In this paper, we propose a novel technique that automatically identiﬁes relevant and speciﬁc API classes from Stack Overﬂow Q & A site for a programming task written as a natural language query, and then reformulates the query for improved code search. We ﬁrst collect candidate API classes from Stack Overﬂow using pseudo-relevance feedback and two term weighting algorithms, and then rank the candidates using Borda count and semantic proximity between query keywords and the API classes. The semantic proximity has been determined by an analysis of 1.3 million questions and answers of Stack Overﬂow. Experiments using 310 code search queries report that our technique suggests relevant API classes with 48% precision and 58% recall which are 32% and 48% higher respectively than those of the state-of-the-art. Comparisons with two stateof-the-art studies and three popular search engines (e.g., Google, Stack Overﬂow, and GitHub native search) report that our reformulated queries (1) outperform the queries of the stateof-the-art, and (2) signiﬁcantly improve the code search results provided by these contemporary search engines."

Nowadays, professional YouTubers are organized in so called multi-channel networks (MCNs). These networks offer services such as brand deals, equipment, and strategic advice in exchange for a share of the YouTubers’ revenue. A major strategy to gain more subscribers and, hence, revenue is collaborating with other YouTubers. Yet, collaborations on YouTube have not been studied in a detailed quantitative manner. This paper aims to close this gap with the following contributions. First, we collect a YouTube dataset covering video statistics over three months for 7,942 channels. Second, we design a framework for collaboration detection given a previously unknown number of persons featuring in YouTube videos. We denote this framework for the analysis of collaborations in YouTube videos using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based approach as CATANA. Third, we analyze about 2.4 years of video content and use CATANA to answer research questions providing guidance for YouTubers and MCNs for efficient collaboration strategies. Thereby, we focus on (i) collaboration frequency and partner selectivity, (ii) the influence of MCNs on channel collaborations, (iii) collaborating channel types, and (iv) the impact of collaborations on video and channel popularity.

1807.06489,data,207,2022-07-09,0,"A major drawback of most existing KBP prediction methods is their reliance on lowdimensional hand-tailored features derived from patient geometry to predict new dose distributions. In contrast, we propose a new paradigm for generating KBP predictions that automatically learns to predict a 3D dose distribution directly from a CT image. More speciﬁcally, we recast the dose prediction problem as an image colorization problem, which we solve using a generative adversarial network (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014). GANs, which have produced impressive results in other image colorization applications (Isola et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2017), involve a pair of neural networks: a generator that performs a task and a discriminator that evaluates how well the task is performed. In our application, the generator serves as a treatment planner that designs a treatment, while the discriminator plays the role of the oncologist who critiques the generated dose distribution by comparing it to the real treatment plan. Both neural networks train simultaneously on historical data, eﬀectively replicating and aggregating the combined knowledge gained during the iterative manual process used to design clinically acceptable treatments."

Our implementation called VividNet is found on Github at https://github.com/Kayzaks/VividNet. Results. In the initial phase, our capsule network has three primitive capsules: [square ], [triangle ] and [circle ]. We begin by showing it an image of a spaceship (LHS of Figure 5), upon which it detects all the relevant graphical primitives, such as three triangles, one circle and one square, but has no semantic understanding of their relation. As this constellation leads to ﬁve activated capsules with no common parent, the meta-learning agent is called into action. In this case, it is obvious that (A.2) is triggered, as there are no semantic capsules yet. The exact split, however, is subjective and up to the oracle. We may treat these primitives as one space-ship (top row of Figure 5) or group them into two independent parts, booster and shuttle, which make up the space-ship (bottom row of Figure 5). In either case, the capsule network is extended by new capsules and trained using only this one example."

Third, it is much easier for researchers to access Sentinel-1 images than TerraSAR-X images because the Sentinel-1 images are freely available, while the TerraSAR-X images are usually commercial. To meet these requirements for high-quality data, we propose a “Dialectical GAN” method based on the analysis of the hierarchical SAR information and the “dialectical” structure of GAN frameworks.

More importantly, the generated language may not adequately reﬂect the affective content of the input. Indeed, humans are adept at this task as well. To address these research challenges, we propose an RNN-LSTM architecture that uses an encoder-decoder network. We also use reinforcement learning that incorporates internal and external rewards. Speciﬁcally, we use emotional appropriateness as an internal reward for the NLG system – so that the emotional tone of the generated language is consistent with the emotional tone of prior context fed as input to the model.

1912.02751,data,197,2022-07-09,0,"Abstract— Most of the existing deep neural nets on automatic facial expression recognition focus on a set of predeﬁned emotion classes, where the amount of training data has the biggest impact on performance. However, in the standard settings over-parameterised neural networks are not amenable for learning from few samples as they can quickly over-ﬁt. In addition, these approaches do not have such a strong generalisation ability to identify a new category, where the data of each category is too limited and signiﬁcant variations exist in the expression within the same semantic category. We embrace these challenges and formulate the problem as a lowshot learning, where once the base classiﬁer is deployed, it must rapidly adapt to recognise novel classes using a few samples. In this paper, we revisit and compare existing few-shot learning methods for the low-shot facial expression recognition in terms of their generalisation ability via episode-training. In particular, we extend our analysis on the cross-domain generalisation, where training and test tasks are not drawn from the same distribution. We demonstrate the efﬁcacy of low-shot learning methods through extensive experiments."

Lastly, the reduction procedure merges all the nodes in a community into one super-vertex and adds up all the inter-cluster and intra-cluster edges separately. Given, that community membership of a node can be accessed in constant running time, it has to traverse all the edges once. Therefore, the network reduction runs in O(|E|). In modularity maximization part, we already work on a reduced graph and so its running time will not exceed the order of the reduced graph, because every node will need to traverse its neighbors trying to ﬁnd the maximum modularity gain. Therefore, the overall worst case running time of our algorithm to create the initial bias for the community detection will be O(|E|).

1806.04357,"corpus, data",313,2022-07-09,0,"We propose a multi-task learning model to jointly perform FT and FSMT using a many-to-one (i.e. multi-language to English) sequence to sequence model (Luong et al., 2016). Following Johnson et al. (2017), we implement this approach using shared encoders and decoders. This approach can use existing NMT architectures without modiﬁcations. We design three models to investigate how to best incorporate side constraints at training time, and the beneﬁts of sharing representations for style and language. MultiTask-tag-style is a straightforward combination of the transfer and translation models above. We hypothesize that using the bilingual parallel data where English is the target could enhance English FT in terms of target language modeling, especially when the bilingual data has similar topics and styles. We therefore combine equal sizes of formality tagged training data (selected as described in Section 3.2) from our FT and FSMT tasks in this conﬁguration (Figure 2a). MultiTask-style is designed to test whether formality tags for bilingual examples are necessary. We hypothesize that the knowledge of controlling target formality for the FSMT task can be learned from the FT data since the source embeddings of formality tags are shared between the FT and the FSMT tasks. We therefore combine the formality tagged FT data with the MT data without their tags (Figure 2b). MultiTask-random investigates the impact of the similarity between formality transfer and bilingual examples. Selecting bilingual data which is similar to the GYAFC corpus is not necessarily beneﬁcial for the FSMT task especially when French-English bilingual examples are drawn from a domain distant from the GYAFC corpus. In this conﬁguration, we test how well our model performs FSMT if bilingual examples are randomly selected instead (Figure 2c)."

They trained and tested their network on Twitter’s ofﬁcial Twitter70 dataset2, and achieved an F-score of 0.912, compared to langid.py’s performance of 0.879 on the same dataset. They also trained and tested their system using the TweetLID corpus and achieved an F1-score of 0.762, above the system of (Gamallo et al., 2014) presented earlier, and above the top system of the TweetLID competition, the SVM LID system of (Hurtado et al., 2014) which achieved an F1-score of 0.752.

Their system breaks the text into non-overlapping 200-character segments, and feeds character n-grams (n = 8) into the GRU network to classify each letter into a probable language. The segment’s language is simply the most probable language over all letters, and the text’s language is the most probable language over all segments. The authors tested their system on short messages, but not on tweets; they built their own corpus of short messages by dividing their data into 200character segments.

One important aspect in this monitoring process is to detect obstacles in the ﬂight path in order to avoid collisions. Since a large number of consumer UAVs suffer from tight weight and power constraints, our work focuses on obstacle avoidance based on a lightweight stereo camera setup. We use disparity maps, which are computed from the camera images, to locate obstacles and to automatically steer the UAV around them. For disparity map computation we optimize the well-known semi-global matching (SGM) approach for the deployment on an embedded FPGA. The disparity maps are then converted into simpler representations, the so called U-/V-Maps, which are used for obstacle detection. Obstacle avoidance is based on a reactive approach which ﬁnds the shortest path around the obstacles as soon as they have a critical distance to the UAV. One of the fundamental goals of our work was the reduction of development costs by closing the gap between application development and hardware optimization. Hence, we aimed at using high-level synthesis (HLS) for porting our algorithms, which are written in C/C++, to the embedded FPGA. We evaluated our implementation of the disparity estimation on the KITTI Stereo 2015 benchmark.

Thus, the network results in a 128-dimensional face representation in a space where distances directly correspond to face similarity. Consequently, classification and clustering are now straightforward by using standard Euclidean distance metrics. Hence, accuracies of 99.63% on the LFW dataset and 95.1% on YTF were measured.

In addition, we include iBLEU (Sun and Zhou, 2012), which penalizes repeating the source sentence in its paraphrase. We use the same hyper-parameter in their original work. We compare DNPG with four existing neural-based models: ResidualLSTM (Prakash et al., 2016), VAE-SVG-eq (Gupta et al., 2017), pointer-generator (See et al., 2017) and the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), the latter two of which have been reported as the state-of-the-art models in Li et al. (2018) and Wang et al. (2018) respectively. For a fair comparison, we also include a Transformer model with copy mechanism. Table 4 shows the performances of the models, indicating that DNPG achieves competitive performance in terms of all the automatic metrics among all the models. In particular, the DNPG has similar performance with the vanilla Transformer model on Quora dataset, while signiﬁcantly performs better on WikiAnswers. The reason maybe that the DNPG is more robust to the noise, since it can process the paraphrase in an abstractive way. It also validates our assumption that paraphrasing can be decomposed in terms of granularity. When the training data of high quality is available, the transformer-based models signiﬁcantly outperforms the LSTM-based models."

The fusion of multispectral bands in the visible spectrum has been exploited to improve face recognition performance over all the conventional broad band face images. In this book chapter, we propose a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework which adopts a structural sparsity learning technique to select the optimal spectral bands to obtain the best face recognition performance over all of the spectral bands. Speciﬁcally, in this method, images from all bands are fed to a CNN, and the convolutional ﬁlters in the ﬁrst layer of the CNN are then regularized by employing a group Lasso algorithm to zero out the redundant bands during the training of the network. Contrary to other methods which usually select the useful bands manually or in a greedy fashion, our method selects the optimal spectral bands automatically to achieve the best face recognition performance over all spectral bands. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state of the art band selection methods for face recognition on several publicly-available hyperspectral face image datasets."

1808.09353,"dataset, open-source",232,,0,"Abstract— The exponential growth of information on the Internet is a big challenge for information retrieval systems towards generating relevant results. Novel approaches are required to reformat or expand user queries to generate a satisfactory response and increase recall and precision. Query expansion (QE) is a technique to broaden users’ queries by introducing additional tokens or phrases based on some semantic similarity metrics. The tradeoff is the added computational complexity to find semantically similar words and a possible increase in noise in information retrieval. Despite several research efforts on this topic, QE has not yet been explored enough and more work is needed on similarity matching and composition of query terms with an objective to retrieve a small set of most appropriate responses. QE should be scalable, fast, and robust in handling complex queries with a good response time and noise ceiling. In this paper, we propose Xu, an automated QE technique, using high dimensional clustering of word vectors and Datamuse API, an open source find semantically similar words. We query engine implemented Xu as a command line tool and evaluated its performances using datasets containing news articles and human-generated QEs. The evaluation results show that Xu was better than Datamuse by achieving about 88% accuracy with reference to the human-generated QE."

While obfuscation techniques are successfully used to protect the intellectual property of apps’ developers, they are unfortunately also often used by cybercriminals to hide malicious content inside mobile apps and to deceive malware detection tools. As a consequence, most of mobile malware detection approaches fail in differentiating between benign and obfuscated malicious apps. We examine the graph features of mobile apps code by building weighted directed graphs of the API calls, and verify that malicious apps often share structural similarities that can be used to differentiate them from benign apps, even under a heavily “polluted” training set where a large majority of the apps are obfuscated. We present DaDiDroid an Android malware app detection tool that leverages features of the weighted directed graphs of API calls to detect the presence of malware code in (obfuscated) Android apps. We show that DaDiDroid signiﬁcantly outperforms MaMaDroid [24], a recently proposed malware detection tool that has been proven very efﬁcient in detecting malware in a clean nonobfuscated environment. We evaluate DaDiDroid’s accuracy and robustness against several evasion techniques using various datasets for a total of 43,262 benign and 20,431 malware apps. We show that DaDiDroid correctly labels up to 96% of Android malware samples, while achieving an 91% accuracy with an exclusive use of a training set of obfuscated apps."

1807.08798,"code, dataset, publicly available, code available",327,,0,"Dataset Collection: We collect 310 code search queries from four popular programming tutorial sites–KodeJava [9], Java2s [6], CodeJava [2] and JavaDB [7]–for our experiments. While 150 of these queries were taken from a publicly available dataset [64], we attempted to extend the dataset by adding 200 more queries. However, after removing the duplicates and near duplicates, we ended up with 160 queries. Thus, our dataset contains a total of 310 (i.e., 150 old + 160 new) search queries. Each of these sites above discusses hundreds of programming tasks as Q & A threads where each thread generally contains (1) a question title, (2) a solution (i.e., code), and (3) a prose explaining the code succinctly. The question title (e.g., “How do I decompress a GZip ﬁle in Java?” [11]) generally comprises of a few important keywords and often resembles a real life search query. We thus use these titles from tutorial sites as code search queries in our experiments, as were also used by the earlier studies [64, 22]. Ground Truth Preparation: The prose that explains code in the tutorial sites above often includes one or more API classes from the code (e.g., GZipInputStream, FileOutputStream). Since these API classes are chosen to explain the code that implements a programming task, they are generally relevant and speciﬁc to the task. We thus consider these relevant and speciﬁc API classes as the ground truth for the corresponding question title (i.e., our search query) [64]. We develop a ground truth API set to evaluate the performance of our technique in the API class suggestion."

1702.02258,"dataset, used dataset",172,2022-07-09,1,We propose a method to generate multiple diverse and valid human pose hypotheses in 3D all consistent with the 2D detection of joints in a monocular RGB image. We use a novel generative model uniform (unbiased) in the space of anatomically plausible 3D poses. Our model is compositional (produces a pose by combining parts) and since it is restricted only by anatomical constraints it can generalize to every plausible human 3D pose. Removing the model bias intrinsically helps to generate more diverse 3D pose hypotheses. We argue that generating multiple pose hypotheses is more reasonable than generating only a single 3D pose based on the 2D joint detection given the depth ambiguity and the uncertainty due to occlusion and imperfect 2D joint detection. We hope that the idea of generating multiple consistent pose hypotheses can give rise to a new line of future work that has not received much attention in the literature. We used the Human3.6M dataset for empirical evaluation.

Each image is annotated with 5 landmarks (two eyes, the nose tips, the mouth corners) and binary labels of 40 attributes. To make a fair comparison with the other facial attribute methods, the standard split is used here: the ﬁrst 160k images are used for training, 20k images for validation and remaining 20k for testing. CelebA provides two types of training images, i.e., aligned and cropped face images and raw images as shown in the ﬁrst and second row of Fig. 4 respectively. We use the raw images for training our joint deep architecture. Since there is no ground-truth bounding box label for faces in raw images, the face detector [4, 11] is employed here to help generate the face bounding box for training images. We use the implementation of dlib toolbox [11, 4] for generating labels. Note that face bounding box generation is only required in the training stages for synthesizing labels. At testing phrase, raw images are directly input for both facial attribute analysis and face detection."
1902.07379,"code, github, code available, data",252,,2,"Current deep neural networks (DNNs) can easily overﬁt to biased training data with corrupted labels or class imbalance. Sample re-weighting strategy is commonly used to alleviate this issue by designing a weighting function mapping from training loss to sample weight, and then iterating between weight recalculating and classiﬁer updating. Current approaches, however, need manually pre-specify the weighting function as well as its additional hyper-parameters. It makes them fairly hard to be generally applied in practice due to the signiﬁcant variation of proper weighting schemes relying on the investigated problem and training data. To address this issue, we propose a method capable of adaptively learning an explicit weighting function directly from data. The weighting function is an MLP with one hidden layer, constituting a universal approximator to almost any continuous functions, making the method able to ﬁt a wide range of weighting functions including those assumed in conventional research. Guided by a small amount of unbiased meta-data, the parameters of the weighting function can be ﬁnely updated simultaneously with the learning process of the classiﬁers. Synthetic and real experiments substantiate the capability of our method for achieving proper weighting functions in class imbalance and noisy label cases, fully complying with the common settings in traditional methods, and more complicated scenarios beyond conventional cases. This naturally leads to its better accuracy than other state-of-the-art methods. Source code is available at https://github.com/xjtushujun/meta-weight-net."

This is followed by the training of models on the two book series with various popular word embedding model types such as word2vec, GloVe, fastText, or LexVec. Finally, we evaluate the suitability of word embedding models for such speciﬁc relation extraction tasks in a situation of comparably small corpus sizes. In the evaluations, we also investigate and analyze particular aspects such as the impact of corpus term frequencies and task diﬃculty on accuracy. The datasets, and the underlying system and word embedding models are available on github and can be easily extended with new datasets and tasks, be used to reproduce the presented results, or be transferred to other domains."

The two most prominent approaches to this problem are structural correspondence learning and autoencoders. However, they either require long training times or suffer greatly on highly divergent domains. Inspired by recent advances in cross-lingual sentiment analysis, we provide a novel perspective and cast the domain adaptation problem as an embedding projection task. Our model takes as input two mono-domain embedding spaces and learns to project them to a bi-domain space, which is jointly optimized to (1) project across domains and to (2) predict sentiment. We perform domain adaptation experiments on 20 source-target domain pairs for sentiment classiﬁcation and report novel state-of-the-art results on 11 domain pairs, including the Amazon domain adaptation datasets and SemEval 2013 and 2016 datasets.

The on-line stage approximates the posterior spatial risk distribution using a sequence of 185 new crimes.

CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK In this paper, an asset, process, and data management framework for the research and development of PHM applications has been proposed. This work was motivated by the lack of a comprehensive simulation environment and data management architecture that addresses requirements speciﬁc to PHM research. Therefore, a requirements analysis into the speciﬁc needs of PHM research and development was done and a new framework has been developed from the ground up. The framework was demonstrated with an end-to-end simulation environment implemented in MATLAB®. Using this framework, simulation changes are easily tracked, generated data is inherently organized, and data integrity is guaranteed. Collaboration is also facilitated when different researchers are using the same framework, making it easier to share code, reproduce results, and build off others work. We demonstrate the use of this framework with a data generation experiment and are left with a couple of different open ended questions that, with this simulation architecture will soon be studied."

MOTIVATION The origin of this work came from the need to generate data for deep learning and reinforcement learning based prognostics applications. We realized that the creation and curation of the data used to generate machine learning models was a bigger challenge than anticipated, and, this especially applies to the evaluation of PHM technology in general. Since data is generated from the simulations, it is important to account for how the data is generated, stored, and later retrieved. Many system-level prognosics experiments utilize some form of Monte Carlo simulation and take a considerable amount of time to ﬁnish. The amount of data can be quite substantial and a lot of time is spent organizing it after-the-fact. Often times the source code contains changes that are not reﬂected in the accompanying dataset, making it difﬁcult to reproduce results. Different component models or degradation processes could be used in different experiments and these differences manifest in the resultant data. When this type of metadata is missing or the dataset lacks an accurate description, validation exercises are typically unsuccessful."

10.36001_phmconf.2015.v7i1.2564,"code, source code",260,2022-05-25,0,"A method central to our approach is fault injection. Software fault injection (Voas & McGraw, 1999) is a common technique used in software testing as a modality to verify the application’s robustness and also tolerance of selected faults. This technique assumes the availability of a selection of operators that inject faults into the application. Among fault injection techniques commonly used for software applications, mutation testing is the oldest one, being introduced for the ﬁrst time in 1971 (DeMillo, Lipton, & Sayward, 1978). Different types of software systems may use the beneﬁts of mutation testing, since it can be successfully applied to different levels of testing and for different programming environments. In the context of mutation testing, we evaluate the quality of a test suite, i.e., a set of test cases, by injecting small software changes, i.e., mutations, at source code or byte code level, and then we verify whether there is some anomalous response. That is, the generated test suite is run against all the mutants generated (the altered software versions), and we investigate whether there is some test case in the suite s.t. the output differs for the original program and a mutant. The mutation score (i.e., the percentage of mutants for which the test suite offers such a test case) serves as metric for assessing a test suite’s quality."
10.36001_phmconf.2015.v7i1.2564,"code, source code",270,2022-05-25,0,"There are two major drawbacks with mutation testing. For there are time complexity issues in respect of the one, ressources needed to run all the tests for all the mutants, speciﬁcally if we include many mutation operators. The other issue is related to interpreting the mutation score. That is, since, most likely, the functional equivalence between a mutant and its original program is not investigated beforehand, we run into the problem of identifying those mutants for which the test suite does not offer a killing test case, but which are functionally (semantically) equivalent to the original program (and thus represent an alternative correct implementation). If this cumbersome process is not executed, such equivalent mutants result in a lower mutation score, which has to be taken into account. There are many tools available for mutation testing, e.g.: FIAT (Fault Injection-based Automated Testing) (Segall et al., 1988), PROTEUM (Delamaro, 1993; Agrawal et al., 1989; Ghosh, 2000) tools for C source code mutation testing, MUJAVA (Ma, Offutt, & Kwon, 2006) a Java based mutation tool, and SQLMutation (Tuya, Su´arezCabal, & la Riva, 2007) and JDAMA (Zhou & Frankl, 2009) for SQL. In this paper we assume that there is such a mutation testing tool for the desired development environment, that in turn allows us to inject faults into the control software."

As the number of features N are increased, not only the average error of RPFB decreases, but also its variance, which is due to the random choice of ﬁlters, decreases too. RPFB outperforms the window-based approach for most values of the number of features. This synthetic example is reassuring as it shows that RPFB is effective in modeling time series data with an analytical model (ARFIMA) without actually trying to directly estimate the parameters of the model."

Type I prognostics is based on past failure time distributions and is often referred to as traditional reliability analysis. This type of prognostic model only utilizes past failure times and does not require any additional failure data. Therefore, it can be conducted before operation of additional cycles. During operation, as stressor information such as operating condition or load is obtained, the model transitions to a Type II prognostic model. In parallel to the Type II models, anomaly detection can be conducted on the failure data. When specific signals such as temperature or pressure are tracked over lifetime and show an increase in damage to the system, the Type I or II model transitions to a Type III prognostic model. Type III models use the tracked degradation across multiple signals to measure the overall system health. The transitions between prognostic model types can be seen in Figure 2."

In large complex networks such as NAS, heterogeneous sources of uncertainty are involved in the process of risk assessment. These uncertainty sources in general can be classified into two categories: aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty (Mahadevan and Haldar 2000). Aleatory uncertainty sources are irreducible sources of variation such as measurement noise and physical variability in system characteristics (such as ground operations and pilot-to-pilot variations). Epistemic uncertainty sources are theoretically reducible that arise out of lack of perfect information such as environmental conditions and vehicle state. Rigorous uncertainty modeling frameworks for the risk assessment of NAS networks must be capable of accurately capturing the important statistical properties of the uncertainty sources (e.g. dependence over time and space between different uncertainty sources) and assess their contributions to the system performance. To enable this level of rigor, the system includes both probabilistic and non-probabilistic approaches to model the uncertainty sources. Probabilistic approaches are being used to quantify appropriate sources of uncertainty as random variables, stochastic processes, and timefield, modeled using probability dependent distributions describe interdependencies. Non-probabilistic approaches such as interval analysis, evidence theory, and fuzzy numbers are being used to create initial models for epistemic sources of uncertainty or where too little data is available to confidently fit the parameters of a probability distribution, and then equivalent probabilistic distributions are determined using the maximum entropy principle. In addition, rare events, which are usually the root causes of failures of the NAS systems, are often caused by simultaneous occurrences which are not only dependent but tail dependent (Bedford and Cooke 2002). Tail dependence measures the co-movement in the lower and upper tails of the joint probability function of uncertainty variables, which is important for the risk assessment of NAS."

Analog sensor data received from AOS are preprocessed and checked against given value ranges and thresholds by the Limit Checker (LC), a built-in component of the cFS system.

We show that this scheme is able to considerably improve the fault detection performance compared to the scarce data training. Moreover, it is shown to detect faults with an accuracy and robustness which are very similar to the single-turbine scheme, in which training and detection are both done on the same turbine with a large and representative training set. We demonstrate this for two different fault types: abrupt and slowly evolving faults and perform a sensitivity analysis in order to compare the performance of the two training schemes.

In this regard, criminal risk models are important to obtain relevant information for better resource allocation and prevention of future crime activity. This paper proposes a method to model and predict future criminal activity based on spatial probabilistic risk functions and a characterization of their temporal evolution as new data become available. This method uses geo-referenced information of public services (e.g., shopping centers, banks) and criminal incidents to approximate the prior risk function as a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Temporal evolution of crime activity is characterized using an algorithm that is based on Sequential Monte Carlo Methods and Importance Sampling. This algorithm incorporates information from new measurements, in a recursive manner, to approximate the posterior spatial probabilistic risk function by updating particle positions in the map. Finally, we propose a novel prediction scheme for criminal activity that uses Gaussian ﬁelds centered on hypothetical future criminal events, which are sampled from a GMM that characterizes the spatial distribution associated with recent crime activity. The optimum number of centroids for each Gaussian kernel is evaluated using Silhouette algorithm. The time index related to each hypothetical future crime event is probabilistically characterized using an exponential distribution. Results using real data show that the majority of future events occur within risk modeled zones, information which can be used for resource allocation and improvement of intervention plans."

In our previous work (Celaya et al., 2011, 2012) EIS measurements (ofﬂine) was seen as the ground truth when estimating capacitor parameters. The opposing method (online) comes from calculation done to the transient voltage data collected. Fig. 6 is a comparison of the online to ofﬂine values of tau. Although these values have a comparable trend, they exhibit a distinct difference in magnitude."
10.36001_phmconf.2015.v7i1.2713,"data https, data",202,2022-05-25,0,"With regards to the experimental setup, the transient voltage data is collected by NI hardware with supporting LabVIEW software whereas the EIS data is collected by different hardware (SP-150 Biologic). A major effect difference in hardware may have is the calibration standards. By using ofﬂine EIS measurements we also change the circuit under which the capacitor is being observed, whereas, if the transient data is measurement online, the capacitor circuit will see the effects of the connected hardware. It would be very difﬁcult to determine the effect that the measurement hardware has on a circuit. When determining the capacitor characteristics from the EIS measurements we apply a circuit model to the data and extract a value for capacitance and ESR. We currently use a simpliﬁed lumped parameter model (C + ESR) when analyzing EIS data. One option to explain is that our model of the capacitor is no long accurate to the capacitors under test. As capacitors are left unused or while in use, their physical/chemical composition may change hence a simple C+ESR lumped parameter model may be obsolete in the later stages of aging."

This paper provided an overview of the different types of failure modes in the DC side of PV system. Next, it summarized the PV fault detection, diagnostics and prognostics approaches. The presented methods presented the different approaches documented in literature to address the faults in the DC side of PV systems. However, depending on the monitoring infrastructure, availability of physical models, and measured data, some solution approaches may perform better than the others due to the difference in the problem formulation. Through the integration of fault detection, diagnostics, and prognostics, future PV systems will possess the ability to sustain the power generation while increasing the reliability and resiliency of the system itself. A review of the PHM applications for PV systems paved the way to emphasize the key research gaps and challenges in the current practice as well as the available opportunities. Future studies are invited to fill the identified gaps by: (1) determining the parameters, location, resolution and precision of required sensors in the PV systems; (2) developing and testing new data-driven models; (3) generating new prognostics models for the different parts and materials of PV systems; (4) verifying and validating the developed models using experimental data; (5) designing online frameworks and algorithms to implement the PHM models; and (6) assisting the decisionmakers in their investigation of the ROI for PHM activities."

A standard approach is therefore to train fault detection algorithms that do not rely on the exact nature of faults, but rather extract information from turbines under normal non-faulty conditions, also known as normal state modeling (Stetco et al., 2019; Schlechtingen & Santos, 2014). After training with normal data only, the algorithm is used for online detection, in which deviations from normality manifest in high prediction errors. In order to detect incipient faults such deviations from normal behavior should be detected as early as possible."

Other than empirical determination, such threshold can also be for both determined continuously monitored discretely monitored degradation. (Javed, Gouriveau, & Zerhouni, 2013) proposed a Fuzzy Clustering method determined by Subtractive-Maximum Entropy to dynamically determine the FT. (R.-y. Jiang, 2010) developed an online and offline alarm threshold determination methodology the inspection scheme in condition-based maintenance (CBM). The alarm threshold is optimized by trade off cost and machine degradation whose information is obtained and updated during last inspection. As for continuous monitoring, rather than a predetermined FT, uncertain FT or probabilistic FT are usually determined with adequate historical or peer information (Wang & Coit, 2007). (Emami-Naeini, Akhter, & Rock, 1988) use nonlinear inequalities to build a sensor threshold selector for fault detection and classification (FDC). The selector is based on errors from a statistical FDC model, signal noise properties and filters properties. (Chehade, Bonk, & Liu, 2017) develops a convex quadratic formulation which consider both historical and real time degradation data to online estimate the FT for each machine. An adaptive failure threshold method is proposed by (Hua, Zhang, Xu, Zhang, & Xu, 2013) to estimate reliability when there is degradation performance on a machine. The threshold is determined by estimating conditional probability density function using a sliding window based dynamic kernel estimation method. (Javed et al., 2013) also proposed an Extreme Learning Machine based method for dynamic threshold decision in continuous state prediction task. (L. Jiang, Feng, & Coit, 2011) developed a failure threshold determination model for dependent failure process. The method considers the dependency of coexisting soft and hard failure for both diagnosis and prognostics."

Also generating degradation data in the laboratory is very costly and the degradation dynamics do not behave as the reality due to the change in environmental and operating conditions (e.g., wind speed variability for wind turbine). Hence, applying a prognostic approach is challenging due to several reason. i) it is difﬁcult to select the most sensitive features in order to detect and predict the degradation using only normal conditions data, ii) it is arduous to construct the HI online; most of the works in the literature select the best features as HI using evaluation criteria in the ofﬂine phase (using run-to-failure degradation data). In order to address these challenges, a prognostic approach dealing with the lack of degradation data is proposed in this work. First of all, a general library is constructed in order to include as much as possible features sensitive to different degradation dynamics. Secondly, anomaly detection method is used since only normal conditions data is available. Anomaly detection or novelty detection is the identiﬁcation of new patterns which differ signiﬁcantly from the patterns generated during normal operation conditions. Hence, One Class Support Vector Machines is applied in order to detect the degradation and trigger the RUL estimation without using degradation data for training. Thirdly, features are ranked online according to meaningful evaluation criteria (monotonicity and trendability), where the feature with high score is selected as HI and used for the degradation predic This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the proposed approach for degradation detection and RUL estimation. Section 3 describes the run-to-failure high speed shaft bearings data and presents the results of the proposed approaches. Conclusion and perspectives are given in Section 4."

The model is built upon an hybrid approach merging physics-based and empirical equations, as well as neural network models in a recurrent neural network cell. The hybrid physics-informed neural network can predict voltage discharge cycles given the loading profile, and estimate the used capacity of the battery under randomloading conditions by tracking aging parameters connected to the residual capacity of the battery. By merging information on the battery aging parameters with existing fleet-wide aging data, the model can predict the future residual capacity of the battery that is being monitored, and therefore enable predictions of voltage discharge curves far ahead in the battery life cycle. We validated the approach using the NASA Prognostics Data Repository Battery data-set, which contains experimental data on Li-ion batteries discharged at random loading conditions in a controlled environment. The approach also allows the identification of discrepancies between the battery aging trend and the trend observed at the fleet level, so that batteries behaving differently from the rest of the fleet can be subject to closer monitoring and further testing to refine predictions."

Ten years ago, HydroQuebec has implemented a home-built web-based application, called MIDA, to cover most of its power plants. MIDA centralizes diagnostic data from several tools, aggregates all diagnostic results and calculates a health index for each hydrogenerators. Data from MIDA used in conjunction with PHM techniques can feed a prognostic model that will provide useful equipment information and lead to the implementation of predictive maintenance. The prognostic framework used for hydrogenerators is based on a failure mechanism and symptom analysis (FMSA) approach. For stator, a major component of hydrogenerators, more than 100 failure mechanisms have been consigned in the form of causal trees or graphs. A large number of these failure mechanisms involve the presence of partial discharges (PD) before failure occurs. At Hydro-Quebec, PD measurements on hydrogenerators have been carried out over the past 30 years and a significant PD database is integrated in MIDA. The analysis of this huge amount of data is of paramount importance to understand the behavior and evolution of the discharge activity in order to build a robust prognostic approach using physics based as well as data driven models. To that end, this paper presents case studies that shed some light on key features related to the evolution of PD activity in hydrogenerators.

MIDA gives a ranking of all generators and thus helps the power plant management prioritize the generators for maintenance. The MIDA centralized database contains all diagnostic measurements performed on each generator."

The evolution of this ratio for phase B (after removing the gap PD contribution) is illustrated in Figure 7. From the PD database, we estimated that when the ratio is between 1 and 1.3, the main PD source is related to internal or delamination type, whereas above 1.3, it indicates the presence of corona PD or slot PD. Similarly, when the ratio goes below 0.90, the discharge process is mostly related to copper-insulation interfacial PD. We see that in some cases, the change in PD process is a better indicator of imminent failure than trending only overall PD intensity."

Lifecycle prognostic models can be updated/transitioned as additional information is gathered. The first information stored in the database will be simple failure times for the different components, which is Type I prognostics. As additional failure times are measured, monitoring efforts can be updated and prognostics based on current information can be assessed. When stressor information is incorporated with the preexisting failure times, the model can be updated to Type II prognostics. As the coupling algorithm reads in more data, it will be able to extract useful signal values related to the failure times of components. For example, if the inlet water temperature sensor value for a pump increases over each failure cycle, the coupling algorithm will identify that temperature signal as useful. Once the coupling algorithm has identified several useful degradation signals, it will store them as Type III prognostic data.

The exponential term can be used to encode extra information in the form of constraints.

Given a hash’s irreversible nature we cannot infer identiﬁable patient information from the database, thus satisfying the de-identiﬁcation constrain. However, given the name and date of birth we can recomputed the hash and retrieve corresponding patient’s information."

This data serves the purpose of model validation and diagnostic algorithm development.

This inconsistency has also been observed by others. For example, (Sharma & Parey, 2016a) calculated condition indicators for three spur gears tests with different crack sizes. Wire Electrical Discharge Machine (EDM) was used to introduced different sized ﬂaws into two of the gears and results were provided for different speed ﬂuctuations. They found that the classical CIs did not perform well with increasing damage for all speed ﬂuctuations. They introduced two new CIs, PS-I and PS-II that were able to track the test cases and showed promise, however only one gear at each damage level was tested.

The British Rail Class 390 ﬂeet (Pendolino) features a very high availability, running 1000 miles a day on average, so their wear rate is monotonic and acceptably constant. The prognostics for brake pad degradation are typically conducted with a robust online linear regression technique, which seamlessly accommodates asset-based idiosyncrasies, like the different effort that is exerted on the pad given its location on a motor or a trailer car, on the left or the right hand side of the caliper, etc. This technique is also resilient to abrupt measurement changes due to asset replacements, sensor imprecision, and acquisition failures, while retaining the physical evolution of the wear, which erodes the surface of the pad. This article evaluates the effectiveness of this approach with a dataset of brake pad thickness measurements, at the ﬂeet level (around 12000 asset instances), using a sliding window technique, and reﬁnes its performance with a neural network ensemble, which blends physical and location features. The results of the analysis prove that this method meets the requirements of the maintenance staff and thus yields a new avenue for business improvement through the application of the predictive maintenance approach for brake pads."

A historical flight dataset recorded from multiple onboard sensors in aircraft was utilized to perform the proposed method. Signal processing technique called decimation, and Savitzky-Golay filter was used to synchronize different sampling frequencies and reduce inherent noise in the FDR dataset. The DNN model was adopted to estimate normal engine system behavior related to flight dynamics and trained by the preprocessed features, including engine performance and flight dynamic features. The accuracy of the trained DNN model was evaluated by error measurements (0.0148 RMSE and 0.8432 𝑅2) and the estimation showed good agreements with the features in the dataset. In order to perform anomaly detection, the trained model was combined with a normal estimation error bound for a safety baseline. The real-time detection capability of the proposed monitoring framework was validated through the FDR dataset simulated for realtime and the results showed promising ability in detecting anomalies in engine performance and flight dynamic behavior. Future work will include a development of a monitoring framework that can monitor the whole aircraft system in all flight phases to improve aircraft safety management."

Capacity aging was deﬁned as a time-dependent adjustment to the battery capacity as shown in Eq. (1) with the aging factor K deﬁned in Eq. (2). For the simulations, normal capacity aging was set to reach our failure criteria, 70% of the initial capacity C0, in approximately 3.1 years, that is Cf =70%. This typical time-based aging is shown as the healthy slope in Figure 3, interrupted by the accelerated slope due to a simulated fault. Low-rate degradation always accompanies normal battery operation, therefore we labeled this region as healthy. This region was used to train the autoencoder (see Section 4). The slope was adjusted by the damage factor md in the faulty region which started at the onset of failure point tonset, set at 62.5 hours in our simulations. As listed in Section 6, Table 2, multiple slopes above and below the baseline of md = 400 were considered in our simulation to get a variety of datasets for testing the autoencoder model."

Compared to diagnosis, prognostics still have many challenges to overcome. For an effective prognosis, extracting features which reflect degradation pattern and fault severity properly is the most important stage. And several works have been made in this sense. Siegel et al (2011) used the bearing vibration data from Bearing Prognostics Simulator provided by SpectraQuest and study feature trending using RMS, kurtosis and peak value at bearing fault frequencies acquired from envelope analysis.  Randall & Antoni (2011) published bearing diagnostics tutorial especially for envelope analysis and other signal processing techniques to enhance its performance.

However, most of them are limited to single failure mode and rarely consider comprehensive health index (HI). There are other approaches using data analytics and machine learning algorithms.

The PRONOSTIA bearing dataset is a popular benchmark dataset for RUL estimation since its usage in PHM 2012 data challenge. The winner in the PHM 2012 data challenge presents three methods with different features extracted including spectral kurtosis, various time-frequency domain features using wavelet transform, and human deﬁned features after thorough inspection of the data (Sutrisno et al., 2012). Another health indicator named weighted minimum quantization error crafted by fusing multiple features is used in a model-based RUL prediction method with Particle Filter based algorithm (Lei et al., 2016). In (Guo et al., 2017), related-similarity features are extracted to construct health indicators using RNN but only the similarities to the normal state are considered. In (Chen et al., 2019), the frequency spectrum of the vibration measurements is used directly as input to a RNN based encoder–decoder framework to estimate health indicator and then predict RUL. In the proposed method, similarity-based features from frequency domain are extracted by considering both the normal and failure state. Meanwhile, various typical time domain features are also included. Since the learning data in PRONOSTIA dataset is limited with only 2 run-to-failure bearings for each of the three operating conditions, we construct an ensemble model which contains multiple LSTM networks to estimate the health indicator from the extracted features.

This risk value can statistically reflect the probability of survival under healthy status. Comparatively, the optimal scores are found on relatively higher risk levels when 𝑅𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑙𝑦 is applied. This is because 𝑅𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑙𝑦 generally removes the penalty of scores when a longer RUL is predicted, which could accept a higher risk level.

They argue that knowing the likelihood of failure in the future is not enough to make maintenance decisions that minimize costs and keep the operators safe. In this paper, we present a maintenance framework based on ofﬂine supervised deep reinforcement learning that instead of providing information such as likelihood of failure, suggests actions such as “continuation of the operation” or “the visitation of the repair shop” to the operators in order to maximize the overall proﬁt.

Most of the trials focus on the generation of run to failure data by means of a variable applied force. The data set which is the basis for the investigations in this section has e.g. ﬁve different load states: ﬁrst state is nearly with no force at the beginning of the trial (corresponds to 16 revolutions of the crank lever; at this point, the spring is still unstressed). The second state is an increased load of about 1680 N or 28 revolutions. In case of the third, forth and ﬁfth state the crank lever is turned once at each time (every revolution introduces an increase of 140 N) so that the ﬁfth state corresponds to a load of 2100 N and 31 revolutions, respectively. The results in the next sections are based on the analysis of the stator current signal and its variations due to the radial load only. The mechanism behind these variations can be explained as follows: an increase in the load of the shaft results in a higher displacement of the shaft’s rotation axis. Thus, a varying load also leads to a changing air gap in the asynchronous motor which can be detected in the stator current. The inﬂuences of this varying radial force concerning the PSD and the resulting damage cases are presented in a ﬁrst part.

Next, 330 additional, single-step simulations with 11 different values for a0 per each of the original y0 values were added to the dataset under the assumption that these small cracks would result in paths nearly identical to the original 30 simulations. Finally, the dataset was augmented by manually varying the crack front shape at each growth step, in all simulations. Five different crack front shapes were used ranging from perfectly straight (i.e., a midpoint extension of zero for a parabolic curve) to an exaggerated curve (i.e., a midpoint extension of 0.127 mm). These augmented shapes allowed the surrogates to reach equilibrium during growth in spite of small numerical errors in the crack propagation. In total, the training simulations resulted in 16, 229 training points, each consisting of one unique crack front and its corresponding SIF proﬁles (i.e., KI , KII , and KIII at each front point, γω).

Random noise in each feature, induced by the aircraft sensors and data acquisition system, is filtered out using a weighted averaging window while maintaining inherent variances. The filtered dataset is then fused according to the underlying physics of each sensed feature to reduce redundant features and subsequently trained using the mGMM.

In addition, a strategy called dropout is implemented in this work to enhance the generalization capability of the DNN model, which enables the DNN model to detect off nominal behavior in the FDR dataset. The dropout randomly excludes a certain percentage of neurons in input and hidden layer during training the DNN model, which leads to model averaging to mitigate overfitting problem (Xu, Du, Dai, & Lee, 2014). In this case, flight performance anomalies that significantly deviates from standard behavior may not much contribute to train the DNN model. Because the significant off nominal response in the selected feature is a minor portion of the FDR dataset and therefore these trends are most likely ignored during the training process. Therefore, the DNN model parameters are mainly determined by the majority of the FDR data, which is considered as normal response in engine related and flight dynamic features. To fulfill the estimation accuracy and generalization capability, the percentage of dropout is set to be 5%.

The continuous features generally indicate aircraft states and performance such as fan speed, engine gas temperature, and velocity and angle components of aircraft coordinate system while the discrete features denote binary information such as system alarms and landing gear status. Besides, the sampling frequency of flight features varies between 0.25 Hz to 16 Hz, which restricts the direct application of the dataset to the proposed framework. In this study, a total of 2044 flights are investigated, where the flight times in the dataset vary from 56 minutes to 3 hours and 22 minutes and flight phases are labeled in to 7 digits, parking (1), taxi (2), takeoff (3), ascent (4), cruise (5), descent (6), and landing (7) as shown in Figure 1. Among the flight phases, the proposed monitoring work focuses on detecting engine performance anomalies in cruise phase. The magnitude of engine-related features such as fan speed and exhaust gas temperature are ideally maintained during cruise phase, while fluctuations are observed during multiple ascent and descent phases. Therefore, off-nominal behavior of flight performance is relatively distinguishable compared to other flight phases. However, health metric and standard operation ranges are not presented in the FDR dataset, so it prevents cross-validation of captured operational anomalies from flight accident reports and literature because of unknown information about aircraft type, flight plan, and weather condition. With this limitation, a decision boundary was formed under the assumption that the anomalous flight behavior is uncommon patterns in dataset and presents significant deviation from common patterns due to nonstandard flight operations or mechanical issues in the aircraft systems."

Flight AD is generally based on the assumption that most of the flights in the dataset represent normal operations. The DA process thus involves preparing the data for analysis and the AD process begins with the output from the DA into a detection phase and then followed by the characterisation of the anomalies found as the output of the AD process. The detection phase generally entails performing similarity measures between data points thereby determining the nominal group and using this to ascertain the outlier groups;

AD finds patterns in data that do not conform to expected behaviour (Chandola, Banerjee, & Kumar, 2009). These patterns are called anomalies or outliers and they are often sufficiently different from the majority of data points in the dataset.

It has been extended and investigated for small and medium-sized medical and finance datasets (Gautam, Balaji, Sudharsan, Tiwari, & Ahuja, 2019). MKAD is a semi-supervised algorithm proposed for AD. Heterogenous parameters (continuous and discrete) were handled together. Discrete binary switch sequences are used in the discrete kernel and discretized continuous parameter features are used to form the continuous kernel. MKAD combines multiple kernels into a single optimization function using the One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) framework. The OCSVM uses a training set of nominal examples (in this case, flights) and evaluates test examples to determine whether they are anomalous or not. It combines the strength of both vector space and sequential AD techniques to allow a wider range of anomaly detection. Its ability to combine information from both data types makes it able to identify more complex behaviours of the crew in the anomaly detection process, unlike previous methods. It is, however, more able to find anomalies in discrete data than it is able to detect those from continuous data. For example, while is it was able to detect anomalies in an auto-landing state due to an autopilot mode anomaly, it was unable to detect a high-speed approach based on relevant continuous parameters (Das, Li, Srivastava, & Hansman, 2012). MKAD also needs nominal or near nominal data to learn proper hyperplanes hence, is not appropriate for including multiple nominal data patterns since the trained model could identify other nominal patterns as anomalous."

The average rotational speed of the high-speed shaft was 279 Hz. In general angular resampling is necessary for a proper vibration based condition monitoring of a rotating machine. The angular resampling requires the knowledge of the instantaneous speed of the shaft so that the data can be transformed to the angular domain in order to compensate for the speed variations (Peeters et al., 2019). Nevertheless, the present dataset was sampled under negligible speed variations, hence the angular resampling is not needed. Accordingly, the signal spectrum is dominated by pronounced shaft harmonics. Another potential pre-processing method to improve the effectiveness of blind ﬁltering is the deterministic content removal. The highenergy deterministic content protrudes in the squared envelope spectrum and might mask the bearing fault signature. Since the localized bearing faults manifest themselves as a stochastic process, the energy level of which are lower in the squared envelope spectrum compared to deterministic content originated from the other machine components (Antoni & Randall, 2003). Thus, in order to ensure that the sparsity measure of the blind ﬁltered signal is not skewed by the highenergy harmonics, the deterministic content of the signal can be removed prior to blind ﬁltering using several techniques discussed in literature, i.e. cepstral editing or discrete-random separation (Peeters et al., 2020). However, the signals are not pre-whitened in this study, but instead bandwidths to which blind ﬁltering is applied are adjusted in such a way as to exclude the prominent amplitudes related to the shaft harmonics in squared envelope spectrum.

The proposed NMPM framework comprises of three parallel paths, the ﬁrst one utilizes a noisy Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BLSTM) that used for extracting temporal features and learning the dependencies of sequence data in two directions, forward and backward. The second parallel path, employs noisy MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) that consists of three layers to extract different class of features.

The large negative acceleration peak recorded by Sensor C is evident in the correlation results as the element wise multiplication and integration of correlation produces negative values of correlation and multiple peaks of signiﬁcant amplitude instead of a singular peak.

The chosen data corresponds to 186 flight parameters that are categorized into two classes, based on their features, discrete and continuous. The discrete flight parameters are integers denoting either an on-off state such as landing gear up/down, or a flight status including takingoff, cruising, etc.; the continuous flight parameters include body longitudinal acceleration, position of rudder in degrees, aileron degree and elevator degree, and engine exhaust gas temperature, etc. that are obtained by the on-board sensors and can represent the performance of the aircraft. Therefore, these flight parameters are used to monitor the current condition of aircraft system in this research. Random noise induced by aircraft sensors and the data acquisition system in each feature is filtered through a weighted averaging window while maintaining inherent variances. A robust version of local regression weight linear least square (LOESS) method, available in MATLAB, is used and the window size is set to be 0.2% of the total number of data points. The redundant features are fused to further improve the accuracy and efficiency. For example, the exhausted gas temperature values are averaged into a signal value, since they come from four engines separately, which are identical under most of conditions."

Moreover, different types of materials in PV systems require different studies. Another challenge for the development of PHM models is their verification and validation using experimental data. Knowing that the design life of PV systems is usually more than 30 years, the availability of experience feedback and real performance data over long periods highlights the opportunity to test such models in the future.

The developed BN provides risk knowledge about how anomalous behaviors of ATCOs cause human errors and lead to accidents according to the histories of ATC-related accidents; 2) develop a sensor-based human behavior monitoring algorithm to identify anomalous behaviors of air traffic controllers automatically. The developed algorithm first uses facial landmark detection to extract the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) as an observable feature. Then the algorithm uses the extracted EAR as input to the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to detect anomalous human behaviors. The proposed approach uses the detected anomalous behaviors of ATCOs as inputs to the developed BN based on accident reports and provides probabilities of human errors and ATC-related accidents in real-time."

Generally the performance of diagnostic methods is evaluated by determining the correctness of fault detection results, and the accuracy of fault severity assessment metrics. Of particular interest are the rates at which two diagnostic results occur: false alarms, or when the diagnostic system detects a fault but the condition of the system is not significantly degraded, and missed detection when the diagnostic system does not indicate a fault when one is known to be present. To support this activity, again the field SI and removal data is used to obtain ground truth information about the health state of the fleet. Documented failures, particularly those with a conclusive root cause assessment are extremely valuable in establishing system response at degraded health states. The fleet service history not belonging to known fault cases can be used to establish baseline system performance. Laboratory test results can be used to supplement field data experience, particularly in cases where practical fault experience limited. The validation of prognostic approaches is a far more complex topic and has a more significant set of input requirements (Byington, Roemer, Kalgren, & Vachtsevanos, 2005). Given the long timescale of component life, it is generally impractical to complete significant validation prior to algorithm deployment. However, it is of critical importance to establish the accuracy and uncertainty bounds of the models used to assess and predict system health progression."

As human operators cannot convey their complete understanding of the situation to the system, decision support systems face the challenge of interpreting human intent based on operator inputs, which introduces a high level of uncertainty into the system. In this paper, a decision support system is used for determining system health status as a decision aid to the operator. The goal of this work is to supplement sensor data with human inputs in a prognostic health management environment while minimizing the effects of uncertainty and to provide situational awareness for the operator."

Learning in GP regression corresponds to computing the posterior distribution over the function f (t) conditioned on the observed data y = [y1, · · · , yN ] [15, 13]. The underlying idea in GP regression is that the correlation function introduces dependences between function f (t) values at diﬀerent inputs. Thus, the function values at the observed points give information also of the unobserved points [14]. The structure of the kernel (1) captures high-level properties of the unknown function f (t), which in turn determines how the model generalizes or extrapolates to new test time instants [9].

1606.01039,data,264,2022-05-13,0,"In [20] GPs are used for time-frequency analysis as probabilistic inference. Natural signals are assumed to be formed by the superposition of distinct timefrequency components, with the analytic goal being to infer these components by applying Bayes’ rule [20]. GPs have also been used for underdetermined audio source separation. In [8] the mixture signal is modelled as a linear combination of independent convolved versions of latent GPs or sources. The model splits the mixture signal in frames also considered independent, by using weightfunctions. Thus each source is modelled as a series of concatenated locally stationary frames, each one with its corresponding covariance function. With this assumption the resulting signal is supposed to be non-stationary [8]. On the other hand, despite the approach we present also assumes the latent GPs fm in (10) as non-correlated, the observed signal is not framed into independent segments. Instead of using weight-functions that act over the observed data, we introduce change-windows φm inﬂuencing each latent GP ending up with latent processes representing speciﬁc sound events that happen at certain segments of time. Therefore the proposed model keeps the correlation between the observations throughout all the signal. That is what allows to make prediction in gaps of missing data (section 4.2).

So, it is quite hard to infer the same or diﬀerent-authorship status of given pairs. 2- The test and train documents are from diﬀerent genera and/or topics which makes the learning and prediction process much harder as the word distribution might diﬀer considerably. 3- No writing samples of the future authors is speciﬁed to us during the training and we may have seen no samples by the future authors at all. Under the second schema the scale of the training data is larger compared to the ﬁrst schema. However, we address the problem of identifying the diﬀerence in documents from identical domains in two ways: 1- authorship diversity in similar contents by utilizing Amazon reviews from 300 distinct authors. 2- Scientiﬁc documents from the same area of research by diﬀerent authors who have almost identical level of expertise in the ﬁeld.

A sliding window with the length of l sentences moves forward through each text document by one sentence per step making a smaller document each time. More speciﬁcally, a document with n sentences will be distributed into n − l + 1 smaller documents. New line characters, as well as empty sentences, are ignored here. So, using this expansion technique each problem P = (S, T ) in the small datasets will be converted to P = (DS, DT ) j}lT where DS = {ds j=1 are the set of all shorter documents after expansion of S and T (source and target). lS and lT denote the size of DS and DT respectively."

The best accuracy belongs to the Amazon dataset where we have the largest dataset.

It should be noted that for the two PAN2013 and PAN2014E even after CV the network cannot converge and the validation loss increases after each epoch. To avoid it we increase the total number of document pairs by splitting each document into two smaller ones with an equal number of sentences and making new pairs. This technique decreases the validation loss during training. However, it still suﬀers from lack of labeled examples and causes weakest results compared to the other larger datasets. To illustrate how PRNN discriminate writing styles we provide the t-SNE plot of the output of the fusion layer in a 5-fold CV classiﬁcation for two folds of PAN2015 (Figure 4).

In other words, it is easier to transform one document into the other while they are a diﬀerent-authorship pair (negative pair) compared to a same-authorship pair (positive pair). It makes the results of reconstruction loss to be counterintuitive. The reason is that we represent both documents of each problem under vector space model and only based on the vocabulary of the source document. So, the exclusive features of the target document, the features that only belong to the target but no to the source document, will be ﬁltered under this document representation model. Moreover, it is expected that the documents written by diﬀerent authors have fewer features in common and have more exclusive features than the ones written by the same author. This fact makes the target document of diﬀerent-authorship pair sparser than that of the same-authorship pair. And transforming the source document into a sparse document (its vector is sparse) makes less error than to a dense document (its vector is dense). This feature diﬀerentiates the positive and negative data and exists for both training and test sets and makes the transformation loss a distinctive feature for the veriﬁcation. A more direct way to classify the documents (instead of using classiﬁers) is to simply thresholding the reconstruction error. However, it is only precise for one or two feature sets.

The task is to investigate whether the two documents of a given pair are written by the same author. We consider the authorship veriﬁcation problem for both small and large scale datasets. The underlying small-scale problem has two main challenges: First, the authors of the documents are unknown to us because no previous writing samples are available. Second, the two documents are short (a few hundred to a few thousand words) and may diﬀer considerably in the genre and/or topic. To solve it we propose transformation encoder to transform one document of the pair into the other. This document transformation generates a loss which is used as a recognizable feature to verify if the authors of the pair are identical. For the large scale problem where various authors are engaged and more examples are available with larger length, a parallel recurrent neural network is proposed. It compares the language models of the two documents. We evaluate our methods on various types of datasets including Authorship Identiﬁcation datasets of PAN competition, Amazon reviews and machine learning articles. Experiments show that both methods achieve stable and competitive performance compared to the baselines."

No general solution has been oﬀered for the veriﬁcation problem under this assumption till 2014 [7]. Since then, a few works can be found in the literature: Koppel and Winter [7] propose an almost unsupervised method for the blog corpus dataset using “impostors” method. Optimized Classiﬁcation Trees, the winner method of PAN2014 Essays dataset, optimizes a decision tree based on various types of features and diﬀerent comparison methods including cosine similarity, correlation coeﬃcient and euclidean distance [8]. Multi-headed RNN is a character-level RNN and contains a common recurrent state among all authors with an independent softmax output per author [9]. Fuzzy C-Means clustering, the winner of the PAN2014 competition for novels dataset, adopts C-Means clustering and lexical features for the task [10]. Recently, an approach based on the compression models has been evaluated on PAN datasets [11]. Their method achieves promising results for the two years of PAN competitions but not for the other two datasets. Our methods is similar to these methods and considers the problems with the binary structure but we examine them on all PAN small-scale datasets as well as two large scale datasets."

We report accuracy, the Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve [4] (AUC) and Score=AUC× Acc in TE experiments. The higher AUC and Score indicate more eﬀective classiﬁcation. PRNN schema The plain text of each document is used as the input of PRNN. The features sets for the baselines are the same as the TE baselines. However, we did not use the original training and test sets of the PAN datasets as the size of the training set is too small to be used for PRNN. To avoid overﬁtting problem we perform 5-fold Cross Validation (CV) for the PAN2015, Amazon and MPLA* where we have suﬃcient amount of examples in training folds. And for the PAN2013, PAN2014E and PAN2014N datasets that are relatively smaller we perform 10-fold CV to increase the size of the training folds. This setting is applied for PRNN as well as the baselines. We use Theano to implement PRNN. All classiﬁer’s parameters are the same as the TE schema. The back-propagation is done using stochastic gradient descent with learning rate=0.001, batch size=1, and dropout rate=0.2.

Baseline: We connect several Machine Learning reliable classiﬁers widely used in the area with the seven similarity measures to set strong baselines (Table2). Since each example in our underlying dataset structure comprises two documents, we need to adapt it to the structure of an ordinary classiﬁer input by converting them to one single entity. A simple direct way is to concatenate their feature vectors. However, our experiments show it provides weak results mostly equal to the random label assignment. So, we deﬁne the summary vector as a single unit representative of each example/problem P = (DS, DT ) by utilizing several similarity measures. The summary vector comprises a class of several metrics each measures one aspect of the closeness of the two documents (DS and DT ) of the pair for all underlying feature sets.

While these ranks indicate their popularity (e.g., site trafﬁc) and reliability (i.e., users’ trust) as information service providers, it is reasonable to think that search results from different search engines of different ranks have different levels of acceptance. We conduct an experiment with 75 programming task and exception related queries2 against those search engines and a programming Q & A site (e.g., StackOverﬂow) to determine the relative weights or acceptance. We collect the top 15 search results for each query from each search tool and get their Alexa ranks. Then, we consider the Alexa ranks of all result links provided by each search tool and calculate the average rank for a result link provided by them. The average rank for each search tool is then normalized and inversed which provides a value between 0 and 1. We get a normalized weight of 0.41 for Google, 0.30 for Bing, 0.29 for Yahoo and 1.00 for StackOverﬂow. The idea is that if a result link against a single query is found in all three search engines, it gets the search engine scores (i.e., conﬁdence) from all three of them which sum to 1.00. StackOverﬂow has drawn the attention of a vast community (1.7 million3) of programmers and software professionals, and it also has a far better average Alexa rank than that of the search engines; therefore, the results returned from StackOverﬂow are provided a search engine score (i.e., conﬁdence) of 1.00."

Second, the developed corpus cannot be easily updated and is subjected to the availability of the data dump. For example, they use the StackOverﬂow data dump of September 2011, that means it cannot provide help or suggestions to the recently introduced software bugs or errors after September 2011.

On the contrary, our method– CodeRank– demonstrates a gradual improvement in the performance up to Top-12 terms (i.e., K=12, Fig. 3-(b)), and crosses the performance peak of TF with a large margin (i.e., paired t-test, p-value=0.004<0.05, Cohen’s D=3.77>1.00 (large)), for K=10 to K=15). CodeRank emphasizes on the votes from other important terms (i.e., by leveraging co-occurrences) for determining weight of a term, and as demonstrated in Fig. 3, this weight is found to be more reliable than TF.

However, code comments are often inadequate or outdated [51]. All identiﬁer types also do not have the same level of importance. For example, while the signature of a method encodes the high level its body focuses on granular level implementation details and thus possibly contains more noisy terms [23]. In fact, Hill et al. [23] ﬁrst analyze method signatures and ﬁeld signatures to suggest natural language phrases as queries for code search. In the same vein, we thus also consider method signatures (msig) and ﬁeld signatures (f sig) as the source for our candidate reformulation terms. We extract structured identiﬁer names from these signatures using appropriate regular expressions [42] (Step 4, Fig. 2). Since different contexts of a source document might convey different types or levels of semantics (i.e., developers’ intent), we develop a separate candidate token set (CTsig) for each of the two signature types (sig ∈ {msig, f sig}) from the feedback documents (∀d ∈ DRF ) as follows: CTsig ="

We prepare three token sets–CTmsig, CTf sig and CTcomb from these signatures (Lines 6–12, Algorithm 1, Step 4, Fig. 2) where CTcomb combines tokens from both signatures. Then we perform limited natural language preprocessing on each token set where Samurai algorithm [14] is used for token splitting. We develop separate term graph for each of these token sets where individual terms are represented as vertices, and term co-occurrences are encoded as connecting edges (Lines 3–7, Algorithm 2, Step 5, Fig. 2). We apply CodeRank term weighting to each of the graphs which provides a ranked list of terms based on their relative importance.

Developers often encode their intent behind the code and domain vocabulary into the carefully crafted identiﬁer names where multiple terms are concatenated. For example, the method name–getChatRoomBots–looks like a natural language phrase–“get chat room bots”–when splitted properly. Please note that each of these three terms–“chat”, “room” and “bots”– co-occur with each other to convey an important concept– a robotic technology, and thus, they are semantically connected. On the other hand, the remaining term–“get”– cooccurs with them due to a temporal relationship (i.e., develops a verbal phrase). Similar phrasal representations (reﬁned with lexical matching) were directly returned by Hill et al. for query reformulation. However, their approach could be limited due to the added constraint (e.g., warrants query terms in signatures). We thus perform further analysis on such phrases, and exploit the co-occurrences among the terms for our graph based term weighting. In particular, we encode the term co-occurrences into connecting edges (E) in the term graph (G(V, E)) where the individual terms (Vi) are denoted as vertices (V )."

Software issue reports (a.k.a., change requests) discuss both unexpected (or erroneous features such as bugs) and expected but nonexistent features (e.g., new functionality). For both bug resolution and new feature implementation, a developer is required to map the concepts discussed in the issue report to appropriate source code within the project which is widely known as concept location [29, 31, 40]. Developers generally choose one or more important keywords from the report texts, and then use a search method (e.g., regular expression) to locate the source code entities (e.g., classes, methods) that need to be changed. Unfortunately, as the existing studies [28, 30] report, developers regardless of their experience perform poorly in choosing appropriate search terms for software change tasks. According to Kevic and Fritz [28], only 12.20% of the search terms chosen by the developers were able to locate relevant source code entities for the change tasks. Furnas et al.

While all these above techniques are reported to be novel or effective, most of them also share several limitations. First, source documents contain both structured items (e.g., method signatures, formal parameters) and unstructured items (e.g., code comments). Unfortunately, many of the above reformulation approaches [16, 21, 49] treat the source documents as simple plain text documents, and ignore most of their structural aspects except structured tokens. Such inappropriate treatment might lead to suboptimal or poor queries. In fact, Hill et al. [23] ﬁrst consider document structures, and suggest natural language phrases from method signatures and ﬁeld signatures for local code search. However, since they apply only simple textual matching between initial queries and the signatures, the suggested phrases are subject to the quality of not only the given queries and but also of the identiﬁer names from those signatures. Second, many of these approaches often directly apply traditional metrics of term importance (e.g., avgIDF [20], TF-IDF [43]) to source code which were originally targeted for unstructured regular texts (e.g., news article) [26].

They apply machine learning on these properties, and separate high quality queries from low quality ones. We thus also similarly apply machine learning on our reformulation candidates (and their metrics), and develop classiﬁer model(s) where Classiﬁcation And Regression Tree (CART) is used as the learning algorithm [19]. Since only the best of the four reformulation candidates (i.e., including baseline) is of our interest, the training data was inherently skewed. We thus perform bootstrapping (i.e., random resampling) [27, 50] on the data multiple times (e.g., 50) with 100% sample size and replacement (Step 9, Fig. 2), train multiple models using the sampled data, and then record their output predictions. Then, we average all the predictions for each test instance from all models, and determine their average probability of being the best candidate reformulation. Thus, we identify the best of the four candidates using our models, and suggest the best reformulation to the initial query (Lines 16–20, Algorithm 1, Steps 10, 11, Fig. 2). Bassett and Kraft [8] suggest that repetition of certain query terms might improve retrieval performance of the query. If none of the candidates is likely to improve the initial query according to the quality model (i.e., baseline itself is the best), we repeat all the terms from the initial query as the reformulation.

While 55% query improvement is the maximum performance provided by any of the existing approaches, our technique–ACER–improves about 70% of the baseline queries (i.e., 1% difference between Table V and Table IX due to rounding error) which is signiﬁcantly higher, i.e., paired t-test, p-value=6.663e-06<0.05, Cohen’s D=2.43>1.00 (large).

Image spam is one of such technique where the spammer varies and changes some portion of the image such that it is indistinguishable from the original image fooling the users. This paper proposes a deep learning based approach for image spam detection using the convolutional neural networks which uses a dataset with 810 natural images and 928 spam images for classiﬁcation achieving an accuracy of 91.7% outperforming the existing image processing and machine learning techniques.

Some of the examples, such as the relational analysis of merge sort (msort), have rather complex paper proofs. However, in all cases, the total typechecking time (including existential elimination and SMT solving) is less than 1s, suggesting that the approach is practical. Table 1 shows the experimental results over a subset of our example programs (our appendix lists all our example programs, including their code and experimental results).

The goal of this exercise is primarily to illustrate some of our heuristics. The merge sort function, msort, splits a list into two nearly equal-sized sublists using an auxiliary function we call bsplit, recursively sorts each sublist and then merges the two sorted sublists using another function merge. In their paper on RelCost, Çiçek et al. [14] show that the relative cost of two runs of msort with two input lists of length n that diﬀer in at most α positions is upper-bounded by Q(n, α) = ) · min(α, 2H −i ), where H = ⌈log2(n)⌉ and h is a speciﬁc linear function. This open-form expression lies in O(n · (1 + log2(α))).1 Next, we explain at a high-level how this relative cost is typechecked bidirectionally. We show below the code of the top-level merge sort function msort. ﬁx msort(_).Λ.Λ.λl .case l of nil → nil | h1 :: tl1 → case tl1 of nil → cons(h1, nil) | _ :: _ → let r = bsplit ()[ ] [ ] l in"

Our ﬁrst step, named RelRef, adds relational reﬁnement types over lists (as an example of an inductive data type), and a comonadic type that represents syntactic equality of two values. Our second step, named RelRefU, adds to RelRef the possibility to relate arbitrary programs of possibly dissimilar syntactic structure, thanks to the possibility to switch to a complementary unary type system. Both these extensions add intrinsic nondeterminism to the type system to allow a programmer ﬂexibility in writing programs. The source of nondeterminism in both these systems is non-syntax-directed typing and subtyping rules. RelRef has such rules for relational reﬁnement types and for subtyping, while RelRefU has such a rule for switching to unary typing and more such rules for subtyping."

On the other hand, high-dimensional multiview features will inevitably generate expensive computation cost and cause massive storage cost. Moreover, they may contain adverse noises, outlying entries, irrelevant and correlated features, which may be detrimental to the subsequent learning process [Zhu et al., 2016b; Zhu et al., 2016a; Zhu et al., 2017a]. Unsupervised multi-view feature selection [Wang et al., 2016; Li and Liu, 2017] is devised to alleviate the problem. It selects a compact subset of informative features from the original features by dropping irrelevant and redundant features with advanced unsupervised learning. Due to the independence on semantic labels, high computing efﬁciency and well interpretation capability, unsupervised multiview feature selection has received considerable attention in It becomes a prerequisite component in various literature. machine learning models [Li et al., 2017]."
1904.11228,data,204,2022-05-13,0,"The key problem of multi-view feature selection is how to effectively exploit the diversity and consistency of multi-view features to collaboratively identify the feature dimensions, which could retain the key characteristics of the original features. Existing approaches can be categorized into two major families. The ﬁrst kind of methods ﬁrst concatenates multiview features into a vector and then directly imports it into the conventional single-view feature selection model. The candidate features are generally ranked based on spectral graph theory. Typical methods of this kind include Laplacian Score (LapScor) [He et al., 2005], spectral feature selection (SPEC) [Zhao and Liu, 2007] and minimum redundancy spectral feature selection (MRSF) [Zhao et al., 2010]. Commonly, the pipeline of these methods follows two separate processes: 1) Similarity structure is constructed with ﬁxed graph parameters to describe the geometric structure of data. 2) Sparsity and manifold regularization are employed together to identify the most salient features. Although these methods are reported to achieve certain success, they treat features from different views independently and unfortunately neglect the important view correlations."

Representative works in       clude adaptive multi-view feature selection (AMFS) [Wang et al., 2016], multi-view feature selection (MVFS) [Tang et al., 2013] and adaptive unsupervised multi-view feature selection (AUMFS) [Feng et al., 2013]. These methods ﬁrst construct multiple view-speciﬁc similarity structures1 and then perform the subsequent feature selection based on the collaborative (combined) similarity structure. These two processes are separate and independent. The collaborative similarity structure remains ﬁxed during feature selection. The latently involved data noises and outlying entries in the view-speciﬁc similarity structures will adversely reduce the reliability of the ultimate collaborative similarity structure for feature selection. Furthermore, conventional approaches generally employ knearest neighbors assignment to construct the view-speciﬁc similarity structures and the simple weighted combination for ultimate similarity structure generation. This strategy can hardly achieve the ideal state for clustering that the number of connected components in the ultimate similarity structure is equal to the number of clusters [Nie et al., 2014].

It describes the local geometric structure of data in each view with local descriptor and performs the feature selection in a general trace ratio optimization. In this method, the feature dimensions are determined with trace ratio criteria. Adaptive unsupervised multi-view feature selection (AUMFS) [Feng et al., 2013] addresses the feature selection problem for visual concept recognition. It employs l2,1 norm [Nie et al., 2010] based sparse regression model to automatically identify discriminative features. In AUMFS, data cluster structure, data similarity and the correlations of different views are considered for feature selection.

It is expected to exceed 50 billion connected devices by 2020 and most of these nodes cannot be connected by wireline. In order to enable critical applications such as smart factories or smart buildings, the networking protocols have to deal with the non-deterministic nature of wireless links. In the 5th generation communication system, the secure and reliable data packets will rely on the network with high availability and low latency."

It provides networks facility to android devices for communication in infrastructure less network. Whereas our research is concerned about the high-performance communication in internet of smart devices for smart cities. The main contribution of this research is the creation of the reliable communication framework and provide secure, reliable and fast communication using Tactile Internet among the internet of smart devices.

1906.08554,data,270,2022-05-13,0,"The main contribution of this research is designing a framework for ultra-reliable, low latency and high availability communication in Internet of smart devices for future smart cities using the Tactile Internet. The proposed framework is specifically appropriate for applications in which data is periodically transmitted in internet of smart devices environment. In these applications, on one hand, packets are being produced based on a certain periodic time pattern. On the other hand, service time is always a random variable with general distribution. Therefore, service time might temporarily exceed the period time which, as an inevitable consequence some packets might encounter a busy channel and be dropped. We solve this problem by proposing the new communication framework. We demonstrate that proposed reliable framework, not only increases the throughput, but also the direct connection between the generation (sensors) and communication packet systems are eliminated which make the system far more stable. Moreover, in order to enhance the proposed model, we have employed retransmission scheme, variable packet length, and saturated traffic condition. The solution of this research is summarized as follows. The implementation of proposed framework for communication among internet of smart devices in 5G will be programmed to execute on to the internet of things using Tactile Internet concepts. The idea will focus into three main concepts, these concepts are Reliability, Security and availability. The proposed study supports the wireless networking technology to establish a reliable framework among internet of devices for smart cities."

In this classiﬁcation task, our model can classify a randomly chosen time-series as a sample of VAR or SVAR. Note, with very few samples, models based on the pre-trained encoder (FPT and UFPT) outperform supervised models. However, as the number of samples grows, the accuracy achieved with or without pre-training levels out.

1912.0313,data,212,2022-05-13,0,"Unsupervised pre-training is a well-known technique to get a head start for the deep neural network. It may be considered as a regularizer which compares to classical regularizers (i.e. L1/L2) may not vanish even with more data and could ﬁnd a robust local minima for better generalization [6]. Classical methods are Deep Beliefs Networks (DBMs) [7] and stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAE) [8]. Unsupervised pre-training has broad implications in ﬁelds such as computer vision [9], natural language processing (NLP) (GPT2 [10], BERT [11], Word2Vec [12]) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) (with SDAE [13], with DBN-HMMs [14]). However, this unsupervised pre-training is considered to be less popular in ﬁelds other than NLP [15]. Speciﬁcally, in computer vision, researchers usually use the model which is pre-trained in supervised fashion on Imagenet as a starting point for downstream tasks. Furthermore, given enough data and technical strategies, it is possible to achieve better results on COCO object detection without supervised pre-training on Imagenet [16]."

Although the utility of these results is highly promising by itself, we conjecture that direct application to spatio-temporal data will warrant beneﬁts beyond improved classiﬁcation accuracy in the future work. Working with ICA components is a smaller and thus easier to handle space that exhibits all dynamics of the signal, in future we will move beyond ICA pre-processing and work with fMRI data directly.

However, the obtained data for a single subject is of high dimensionality m and to be useful for learning, and statistical analysis, one needs to collect datasets with a large number of subjects n. Yet, for any kind of a disorder, demographics or other types of conditions, a single study is rarely able to amass datasets large enough to go out of the m (cid:29) n mode. Traditionally this is approached by handcrafting features [3] of much smaller dimension, effectively reducing m via dimensionality reduction. Often, the dynamics of brain function in these representations vanishes into proxy features such as correlation matrices of functional network connectivity (FNC) [4].

In this paper, we investigate the results provided by deep neural networks for the detection of malaria, diabetic retinopathy, brain tumor, and tuberculosis in different imaging modalities.

Several machine learning and deep learning architectures have been proposed in the literature for automated Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) tools for various applications [1-4]. In the past few years, deep learning networks have been used widely in medical imaging applications [1, 3]. Residual Networks (ResNet) [5] and GoogLeNet [6] are some of the most popular networks used in this field. The availability of a vast variety of networks raises the question of choosing the optimal network for a given disease/condition. In a data science perspective, optimal results could be measured in terms of overall accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve, or any other performance metric. However, these optimal results might not be satisfactory for the doctors if the results are not interpretable. Determining the Region of Interest (ROI) that contributed to the decision making of the network will enhance the understanding for both data science experts and clinicians."

This type of CAD system would let the medical expert analyst choose the algorithm based on their discretion in terms of CAM results, overall accuracy, AUC, or any other performance metric along with computation time and memory consumption. CAM results could be utilized by data science experts to further optimize their respective models in terms of architecture and/or preprocessing techniques. This type of CAM study would also assist the researchers in understanding the discriminative regions determined by various architectures in different imaging modalities. For instance, if an architecture achieves a high CAD detection accuracy for a particular dataset but the discriminative region determined using CAM is present in an unrelated area, performance metrics might mislead both data science researchers and medical expert analysts. Hence, CAM visualization would provide the necessary documentation for the medical expert analysts to enhance the trust in CAD system.

This was achieved by changing the data extraction phase from obtaining separately each complete instrument part to obtain every instrument part at every beat. This allowed us to train a set of instruments at the same time from a concrete set of symphonies. This way, the generated parts present a considerable increment of coordination and it is easier to differentiate each musical phrase, as each instrument part respects or accompanies the others."

Two approaches to the goal were established; ﬁrstly, the system was trained with each instrument individually, to generate all the different instrument’s parts, and then put them all together in a conductor’s score. Nevertheless training each part individually lead to a lack of coordination, so a new approach was addressed. This second approach consisted in training the system with information from different instruments at the same time, extracting the data vertically, to maintain the harmony (vertical) and time (horizontal) information."

Although there is no constancy of the existence of the 10th Symphony score, there exists some manuscripts found in Beethoven’s house after his death that are thought to be part of the upcoming Symphony. In 1988 Barry Cooper tried to ﬁnish it, building from 50 of those fragments the ﬁrst movement of the Symphony. Those manuscripts are kept in the museum dedicated to his life in his natal city, Bonn, although they can be seen online 1. The public manuscript is not easy to read and understand, so that existing data will not be used in this paper."
2005.10539,data,138,2022-05-13,0,"Ludwig van Beethoven composed his symphonies between 1799 and 1825, when he was writing his Tenth symphony. As we dispose of a great amount of data belonging to his work, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the possibility of extracting patterns on his compositional model from symbolic data and generate what would have been his last symphony, the Tenth. A neural network model has been built based on the Long Short-Therm Memory (LSTM) neural networks. After training the model, the generated music has been analysed by comparing the input data with the results, and establishing differences between the generated outputs based on the training data used to obtain them. The structure of the outputs strongly depends on the symphonies used to train the network."

In order to represent the output of the training, i.e. the weights of the different notes and durations, the model also returns a HDF5 ﬁle, i. e., Hierarchical Data Format version 5, commonly used to store big quantities of data. After the prediction process, given the obtained weights, Music21 allows us to generate the ﬁnal output in MIDI or MusicXML, formats accepted by Musescore (so the score can be visualised and played)."

Then, the Dropout layers prevent overﬁtting, ignoring randomly selected neurons during the training, setting those inputs to 0. The Dense (Density) layer serves as a full connection mechanism. This layer is the last one, so the system returns the same number of outputs as the different numbers of tuples (note name, note duration) the input data had. Finally, the activation function used for every layer is set, and it determines how each node’s output is represented. In this case, the softmax function (i. e., linear activation) is used, allowing the output to be interpreted as a probability between 0 and 1."

There exists several types of neural networks, such as Deep Neural, Deep Brief and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). In this paper we work with the last ones, since we need to process sequential data, assuming that each event depends on previous ones. The most accurate RNN variant is the LSTM. As proved with Figure 1, we need the memory that this type of networks own. On it we ﬁnd the sequence F - F - F, a predictor without memory would return another F, although by learning from the notes before, it can extract that after three equal notes, it is probable that the upcoming note is two tones below the last one."

They have the ability to connect previous knowledge to a present task. Each cell has memory, and it decides to store or forget a data based on a given priority (i. e., represented as weights), assigned by the algorithm after the learning process. Figure 3 shows a LSTM cell or neuron. The top line represents the ﬂow of the cell state, which can be altered up to three times. The ﬁrst layer, sigmoid (σ), takes information from the previous state and determines if it is useful or not, returning a value between 0 and 1. As it is shown with the vertical arrow, it directly affects to the ﬂow of the cell state. The second layer is composed of the combination of the sigmoid (σ) and tanh functions, which chooses the data to be updated from the previous state, and creates a vector of candidate values to be added to the current cell state. The ﬁnal sigmoid (σ) layer determines the output, by deciding which parts of the state are more relevant. Those will be combined with a tanh function, converting the current state into values between 1 and -1 (Gulli and Pal 2017)."

Then, the Music generation subsection is divided in: dataset creation, training, and prediction.

Also, the instrument or instruments with which the system works has to be established, so the Python module music21 can divide the mxl score into all the present instruments, and take only the desired parts. This way, in the ﬁrst approach, where the goal is to obtain each instrument’s part individually, the note names and durations are stored in an independent ﬁle, being the different tuples of note names and durations the training data. Nevertheless, as the second approach trains the model with a set of chosen instruments at the same time, we need to store, besides the note name and duration, the offset (i. e., time data relating to the moment in which the note is being played regarding the score) and the name of the instrument that plays it. The offset information will be used to sort the data. After making sure that the events are sorted in a time-line as they are in the original score, it can be removed from the dataset, in order to reduce the data dimensionality and to avoid an overlearning problem in the model. This way, the training data will be composed of the different tuples of note names, note durations and the instrument’s name playing it (introduced in the second approach). At this point, a dictionary to encode each data tuple as a number is created, so the neural network can work with it. This dictionary will be also used for the decoding phase, after the prediction."

Furthermore, every musical action and representation that we needed to perform, was made possible using that library. For the Deep Learning engine we have used Keras 3 (Gulli and Pal 2017). Finally, in order to manage the score formats, Musescore 4 (i. e., open source program available for every platform) brought us the possibility to import and export the symphonies, so we could see the score and listen to it at the same time."

Since it needs to work over the same model, it is created again, with the same parameters, but now, instead of training the model, it loads the generated weights from the previous process (i. e., the hdf5 ﬁle). It is important at this point that the network input shapes and the loaded weights have the same dimensions.

Without the need of revisiting any distributed subset of data samples, the GP predictive qC(uk) is playing a different role in contrast with the usual one. Typically, we assume the approximate posterior ﬁxed and ﬁtted, and we evaluate its performance on some test data points.

However, there are no restrictions in our single-output model to accept different likelihoods p(yi|f (xi)) per data point {xi, yi}. An inconvenience of the bound in (1), is that, each i-th expectation term could be imbalanced with respect to the others. For example, if mixing Bernoulli and Gaussian variables, binary outputs could contribute more to the objective function than the rest, due to the dimensionality. To overcome this issue, we ﬁt a local GP model to each heterogeneous variable. We join all models together using the ensemble bound in (6) to propagate the uncertainty in a principled way.

(2016) of how stochastic processes and their integral operators are affected by projection functions, that is, different linking mappings of the function f (·) to the parameters θ. In such cases, the local lower bounds Lk in (1) might include expectation terms that are intractable. Since we build the framework to accept any possible data-type, we propose to solve the integrals via Gaussian-Hermite quadratures as in Hensman et al. (2015); Saul et al. (2016) and if this is not possible, an alternative would be to apply Monte-Carlo methods. Computational cost and connections. The computational cost of the local models is O(NkM 2 k ), while the global GP reduces to O(((cid:80) k Mk)M 2) and O(M 2) in training and prediction, respectively. The methods in Table 1 typically need O((cid:80) k ) for global prediction. A last theoretical aspect is the link between the global bound in (6) and the underlying idea in Tresp (2000); Deisenroth and Ng (2015). Distributed GP models are based on the application of CI to factorise the likelihood terms of subsets. To approximate the posterior predictive, they combine local estimates, divided by the GP prior. It is analogous to (6), but in the logarithmic plane and the variational inference setup."

The ﬂexible nature of GP models for deﬁnining prior distributions over non-linear function spaces has made them a suitable alternative in many probabilistic regression and classiﬁcation problems. However, GP models are not immune to settings where the model needs to adapt to irregular ways of accessing the data, e.g. asynchronous observations or missings input areas. Such settings, together with GP model’s well-known computational cost for the exact solutions, typically O(N 3) where N is the data size, has motivated plenty of aproaches focused on parallelising inference. Regarding the task of distributing the computational load between learning agents, GP models have been inspired by local experts (Jacobs et al., 1991; Hinton, 2002). Two seminal works exploited this connection before the modern era of GP approximations. While the Bayesian committee machine (BCM) of Tresp (2000) focused on merging independently trained GP regression models on subsets of the same data, the inﬁnite mixture of GP experts (Rasmussen and Ghahramani, 2002) increased the model expresiveness by combining local GP experts. Our proposed method will be closer to the ﬁrst approach whilst the second one is also amenable but out of the spirit of this work. The emergence of large datasets, with size N >104, led to the introduction of approximate models, that in combination with variational inference (Titsias, 2009), succeed in scaling up GPs.

To do so, we begin by generating toy samples from the sinusoidal function f (x). The comparative experiment is divided in two parts, in one, we observe N = 103 and in the other, N = 104 input-output data points. In the ﬁrst case, we splitted the dataset D in K = 50 tasks with Nk = 200 and Mk = 3 per partition. Any of these distributed subsets were overlapping, and their corresponding input-spaces concatenated perfectly in the range x ∈ [0.0, 5.5]. For the setting with N = 104 samples, we used K = 500 local tasks, that in this case, were overlapping. As we already commented in the main manuscript, the baseline methods underperform more than our framework in problems where partitions do not overlap in the input-space.

Speciﬁcally, our goal now is to obtain an approximate posterior q(f ) ≈ p(f |D) by maximising a lower bound LE under the log-marginal likelihood log p(D) without revisiting the data already observed by the local models. We begin by considering the full posterior distribution of the stochastic process, similarly as Burt et al. (2019) does for obtaining an upper bound on the KL divergence. The idea is to use inﬁnite-dimensional integral operators that were introduced by Matthews et al. (2016) in the context of variational inference, and previously by Seeger (2002) for standard GP error bounds. The use of the inﬁnite-dimensional integrals is equivalent to an augment-and-reduce strategy (Ruiz et al., 2018). It consists of two steps: i) we augment the model to accept the conditioning on the inﬁnite-dimensional stochastic process and ii) we use properties of Gaussian marginals to reduce the inﬁnite-dimensional integral operators to a ﬁnite amount of GP function values of interest.

We followed a similar strategy as the one used in the MNIST experiment. After removing the 33% of samples for testing, we partitioned the input-area in four quadrants, i.e. as is shown in Figure 4. For each partition we set a grid of Mk = 9 inducing-inputs and later, the maximum complexity of the global sparse model was set to M = 25. The baseline GP classiﬁcation method also used M = 25 inducing-inputs and obtained an NLPD value of 7.29 ± 7.85 × 10−4 after ten trials with different initializations. Our method obtained a test NLPD of 7.21 ± 0.04.

Addressing this issues, content-aware approaches have been proposed [45], [46] for admitting and replacing items in the cache by exploring descriptive caching hits in the application model or spatial locality (relationships among web objects).

Thus, cache statistics such as hit ratio, the number of objects cached, and average object size can be collected by observing the application and cache at run-time. These data, compared in the context of desired values of these parameters, can be used to decide whether to change the ﬁrst choices. Usually, this process is repeated until an acceptable trade-off between conﬁguration and performance is reached, and then cache strategies are ﬁxed for the lifetime of the product or at least for several release cycles.

In this paper, we present the results of a qualitative study of how developers handle caching logic in their web applications, which involved the investigation of ten software projects with different characteristics. The study we designed is based on comparative and interactive principles of grounded theory, and the analysis of our data allowed us to extract and understand how developers address cache-related concerns to improve performance and scalability of their web applications. Based on our analysis, we derived guidelines and patterns, which guide developers while designing, implementing and maintaining application-level caching, thus supporting developers in this challenging task that is crucial for enterprise web applications."

(Evidence 1), (Evidence 2), (Evidence 3), (Evidence 5), (Evidence 6) and (Evidence 7) Selecting the right data to cache involves a great reasoning effort given that data manipulated by web applications range in dynamicity, from being completely static to changing constantly. To optimize this selection process, there are four primary selection criteria used by developers while detecting cacheable content, which should be used in decisions regarding whether to cache. These criteria are described below, ordered according to their importance; i.e. the higher the inﬂuence level, the earlier it is presented. Data change frequency. Developers should seek for data that have some degree of stability, i.e. those that are more used than changed. Even if data are volatile and change in time intervals, caching still brings a beneﬁt. This is the ﬁrst factor to be considered since caching volatile data implies the implementation of consistency mechanisms, which is not trivial and requires an extra effort and reasoning from developers. In short, the cost of consistency approaches cannot be higher than the beneﬁt of caching. Besides, when stale data is not a critical issue, an approach of weak consistency can be employed, such as time-to-live (TTL) eviction, where data is expired after a time in cache, regardless of possible changes."

The main problem is that solutions for all of these issues usually depend on application-speciﬁc details, and are manually designed and implemented by developers, as shown in the example presented in Listing 1. In this example, we assume that an e-commerce application where a class named ProductsRepository is responsible for loading products from database. To reduce database workload, caching logic is inserted in this class within the methods getProducts, updateProduct, and deleteProduct, which retrieves, updates and deletes content from the database, respectively. The ﬁrst issue is related to the cache-aside implementation and the fact that the cache system and the underlying source of data are not aware of each other (as illustrated in Figure 1). The cache system itself is a passive component, and developers must implement, directly in the application code, ways to assign names to cached values, perform lookups, and keep the cache up to date. The extra logic also requires additional testing and debugging time, which can be expensive in some scenarios. The implementation and maintenance of application-level caching are a challenge because developers must refactor all the data access logic to encapsulate cache data into the proper application-level object, and its direct management leads to a concern spread all over the system—mixed with business code—which leads to increasing complexity and maintenance time.

However, M2 can be an expensive operation (i.e. request the database, call a service or process a large amount of data). Therefore, M1 implements a caching layer, which veriﬁes whether the necessary processing is already in the cache before calling M2 (Step 2). Then, the cache component performs a look up for the requested data and returns either the cached result or a not found error (Step 3). If data is found, it means a cache hit and M1 can continue its execution without calling M2. If, however, a not found error is returned, it means a cache miss happened, then M2 needs to be invoked (Steps 4 and 5). The newly fetched result of M2 can be cached to serve future requests faster (Step 6) and eventually a response is sent to the user (Step 7).

Depending on where caching is implemented, different types of content can be stored, such as the ﬁnal HTML page [16], intermediate HTML or XML fragments [17], [18], [19], database queries [20], [21], [22], [23], or database tables [24]. These alternatives are conceived out of application boundaries and can cache dynamic data automatically, which provide transparent caching components for developers. However, they do not take application speciﬁcities into account, providing good results in general but are less effective where complex logic and personalized web content are processed within the application [25]. Therefore, application-level caching is an appealing technique to improve performance, reduce workload and make the overall user experience more pleasurable by reducing communication delays of web-based systems."

Problem: cache has limited size, so it is important to use the available space to cache data that maximizes the beneﬁts provided to the application. Otherwise, it can end up reducing application performance instead of improving it, consuming more cache memory and at the same time suffering from cache misses, where the data is not getting served from cache but is fetched from the source. Solution: even though there are many criteria that contribute for identifying the level of data cacheability, there is a subset that would conﬁrm this decision regardless of the values of the other criteria. Changeability is the ﬁrst criterion that should be analyzed while selecting cacheable data, then usage frequency, shareability, retrieval complexity, and cache properties should be considered. Figure 6 expresses a ﬂowchart of the reasoning process to decide whether to cache data, based on the observation of data and cache properties. All criteria are tightly related to the application speciﬁcities and should be speciﬁed by the developer."

In this case, a speciﬁc session component is used to keep and retrieve user sessions. (b) If the data changes frequently, it should not be immediately discarded from cache. An evaluation of the performance beneﬁts of caching against the cost of building the cache should be done. Caching frequently changing data can provide beneﬁts if slightly stale data is allowed. (c) Expensive spots (when much processing is required to retrieve or create data) are bottlenecks that directly affect application performance and should be cached, even though it can increase complexity and responsibilities to deal with. Methods with high latency or that consists of a large call stack are some examples of this situation and opportunities for caching. In addition, we list content properties that should be avoided, which do not convey the inﬂuence factors in a good way and lead to problems such as cache trashing. (a) User-speciﬁc data. Avoid caching content that varies depending on the particularities of the request, unless weak consistency is acceptable. Otherwise, the cache can end up being fulﬁlled with small and less beneﬁcial objects. As result, the caching component achieves its maximum capacity earlier and is ﬂushed or replaced many times in a brief period, which is cache thrashing. (b) Highly time-sensitive data.

Compromised participants analyse the targeted global model; the poisoned model is then trained on backdoor data samples using dedicated techniques such as constrain-and-scale accordingly, and feed the parameters to a coordination server as other honest participants. The objective of this attack is that the global model is replaced by a joint model consisting of both original task and the injected backdoor sub-task while retaining high accuracy on the two. The backdoor training at the adversary can be empowered by modifying minimisation strategies such as constrain-and-scale, which optimises both gradients of the loss and the backdoor objective [6]. A parameter estimation mechanism is then used for generating parameters submitted to the coordination server for honest participants’ updates. As secure aggregation is used for preventing the server from inspecting individual models, this poisoning model is unable to detect [9, 6]."

An FL client-side application should oﬀer several options for clients to participate in the training process proactively that allows a client to fully control the local training as well as of the sending/receiving ML model updates to/from a coordination server. Furthermore, FL systems only process data (i.e., local ML model parameters) for an explicit purpose (i.e., aggregates results and updates a global model), which is in ways that clients would reasonably expect whilst having minimal privacy impact. For these reasons, either Consent or Legitimate Interest legal basis can be appropriate for an FL application10."

The FSVRG computes gradients based on data on each local node 𝑘, obtains a weighted average of ℙ𝑘 the parameters from all the 𝐾 local nodes, and updates new parameters for each node after round. This algorithm is then experimented based on public Google+ posts, clustered by about 10, 000 users as local nodes, for predicting whether a post will receive any comments.

Unfortunately, although personal data is not directly sent to a coordination server in its original form, the local ML model parameters still contain sensitive information because some features of the training data samples are inherently encoded into such models [5, 81, 4, 96, 86]. For example, authors in [5] have shown that during the training process, correlations implied in the training data are concealed inside the trained models, and personal information can be subsequently extracted.

Solutions to mitigate model poisoning attack at server-side have to detect and ﬁlter out poisoned model updates from malicious clients (i.e., model anomaly detection) [41, 63]. For this purpose, the server needs to access either participants’ training data or parameter model updates, which breaks the privacy-preservation catalyst of FL. Besides, Secure Aggregation protocol is assumed to be implemented at both client- and server-side, which prevents the server from inspecting individual model updates; consequently, ruling out any solutions for model poisoning attacks [41].

In this regard, FL appears as a game-changer as an FL system does not need to collect and process original training data; instead, a service provider only needs to gather local ML models from participants for assembling the global model. Generally, with privacy-preserving techniques introduced in Section 4, an FL system can assure that the coordination server obtains aggregated local model parameters from participants for global model updates only (i.e., the claimed purposes) while acquiring nothing about individual’s contribution.

The GDPR supervisory board recognises the challenges and relaxes the requirement for AI/ML mechanisms by accepting a general explanation as an indication of how and what personal data is going to be processed. As a result, for an FL system, the right to be informed is achieved as privacy information including purposes for processing local ML model (i.e., to build a global ML model), retention periods (i.e., no longer in use after each training round), and who it will be shared with (only the coordination server) can be determined as in Terms and Conditions when a client accepts to participate in an FL system."

The privacy-preservation advantage of FL compared to the traditional centralised ML approaches is undeniable: It enables to train an ML model whilst retaining personal training data on end-users’ devices. Only locally trained model parameters, which contain the essential amount of information required to update the global model, are shared with a coordination server. Nevertheless, such model parameters still enclose some sensitive features that can be exploited to reconstruct or to infer related personal information as depicted in Section 4.

Furthermore, conventional centralised ML approaches have always come with long-standing privacy risks to personal data leakage, misuse, and abuse. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prospective solution that facilitates distributed collaborative learning without disclosing original training data. Unfortunately, retaining data and computation on-device as in FL are not suﬃcient for privacy-guarantee because model parameters exchanged among participants conceal sensitive information that can be exploited in privacy attacks.

Training over non-IID data has been shown to be much less accurate as well as slower convergence than IID data in federated settings [128]. Konečn`y with his colleagues at Google went further on improving the eﬃciency of the FSVRG algorithms in distributed settings by minimising the information in parameter update to be sent to an orchestration server [71]. Two types of updates are considered called structured updates and sketched updates in which the number of variables used in an ML model is minimised as many as possible, along with the compression of the information in the full model updates. Another ambitious federated optimisation approach is that local nodes are independently trained diﬀerent ML models as a task in a multi-learning objective simultaneously [113]. Generally, local nodes generate data under diﬀerent distributions which naturally ﬁt separate learning models; however, these models are structurally similar resulting in the ability to model the similarity using a multi-tasking learning (MTL) framework. Therefore, this approach improves performance when dealing with non-IID data as well as guarantees the learning convergence [113]."

Unfortunately, due to the black-box operation model and the limitation of the transparency in ML, including FL, training process, results (e.g., a global ML model in FL) are generally generated without any proper explanation [119]. Thus, it is infeasible to predict whether outcomes of an ML model might aﬀect the legal status or legal rights of the Data Subject, or negatively impact on its circumstances, behaviour or choices. Consequently, any FL system fails to comply with the GDPR requirements of the data subject’s right in control of automated decision making.

This is the baseline for the membership attack. Authors in [85, 86, 94] have investigated membership attacks in FL and demonstrated the capability of these attacks in both passive and active approaches. For instance, the gender of a victim can be inferred with a very high accuracy of 90% when conducting this attack in a binary gender classiﬁer on the FaceScrub dataset7. Other features, which are uncorrelated with the main task, can also be inferred such as race and facial appearance (e.g., whether a face photo is wearing glasses) [86]. Nasr et al. proposed an active attack approach called gradient ascent by exploiting the privacy vulnerabilities of SGD optimisation algorithms. This attack based on the correlation between the local gradients of the loss and the direction and the amount of changes of model parameters when minimising the loss to ﬁt a model to train data samples in the SGD algorithms.

For instance, regarding the ""Right to erasure"", if a user requests to delete its data (i.e., local ML model parameters sent to an FL server), literally, the only way to fulﬁl the user’s request is to thoroughly re-train the global model without using user’s data from the round that the user ﬁrst participates [50]. This is unnecessary and impractical in FL settings as only local ML model parameters (possibly privacy guarantee-strengthened with diﬀerential privacy) in aggregated encrypted forms (by using Secure Aggregation and other advanced cryptography techniques) are shared with a coordination server. Consequently, it is worthless for a Data Subject to have control over its local ML model as (i) the model parameters are protected by privacy-preserving techniques from inference attacks; (ii) the server is unable to separate the user’s data from the others, the server also does not store the model once it is aggregated to update the global model; and (iii) the global model is wholly anonymised and cannot be exploited to extract or infer any individual information."

The catalyst of such algorithms is to leverage the increasingly powerful processors in modern personal mobile devices to perform high-quality updates than simply calculating gradient steps. Speciﬁcally, each client not only calculates the gradients but also computes the local model for multiple times; the coordination server only performs aggregation of the local models from the clients. This results in fewer training rounds iterations (thus fewer communications) while producing a decent global model. These proposed algorithms well suited for scenarios that are highly limited communication bandwidth with high jitter and latency. In these scenarios, the naive FSVRG algorithms proposed in [70, 71] are not eﬃcient enough. Indeed, the algorithms are utilised for a realworld application for text prediction in Google keyboard in Android smartphones (i.e., G-board)5 [125]. In this system setting, the FederatedSGD is executed locally on the smartphone to compute gradient descent using local data. The gradient is then sent to an aggregation server. This server performs the FederatedAveraging algorithm which randomly selects a fraction of smartphones for each training round, and takes the average of all gradients sent from the selected participants to update the global model. This updated global model is distributed to all participants; the local nodes will then update their local models accordingly."

Furthermore, as these privacy-preserving techniques such as SMC impose non-trivial performance overheads, further eﬀort on how to eﬃciently utilise such techniques on FL applications are required. Secondly, research on transparency, interpret-ability and algorithm fairness in FL systems should be profoundly carried out. Even though a sub stantial amount of research has been conducted in centralised AI/ML settings, there is still an open question whether these approaches could be employed and how to sensibly adapt them to the decentralised settings where training data is highly skewed non-IID and unevenly distributed across sources. The sampling constraints should be investigated to see how much extend they aﬀect and how to mitigate the bias of the global training model. For instance, the agnostic FL framework introduced in [89] naturally yields good-intent fairness as it modelled the target distribution as an unknown mixture of the distributions instead of the uniform distribution in typical FL training algorithms. This agnostic FL framework, as a result, can control for bias in the training objective. Thirdly, it requires more research on interpretable and unbiased ML models and algorithms that can be employed over encrypted settings to well consolidate with advanced encryption schemes in FL systems. Besides, the trade-oﬀs between privacy utility, accuracy, interpretability, and fairness in an FL framework need to be thoroughly explored."

As a result, adversaries, in case it can successfully derive such model parameters, is unable to accurately reconstruct the original training data or infer some related information. In other words, the perturbation method could prevent adversaries from carrying out inference attacks on a local model trained by a particular client. This privacy-preservation method typically adopts diﬀerential privacy technique that adds random noises to either training dataset or model parameters, oﬀering statistical privacy guarantees for individual data [35, 33, 7].

As a consequence, data anonymisation has to balance well between privacy-guarantee and utility because hiding or removing information may reduce the utility of the dataset. Furthermore, when combined with auxiliary information from other anonymous datasets, a data subject might be re-identiﬁed, subjected to a privacy attack called linkage attack [40]. To prevent from linkage attack, numerous techniques have been proposed such as k-anonymity [116], l-diversity [79], a k-anonymity-based method, and tcloseness - a technique built on both k-anonymity and l-diversity that preserves the distribution of sensitive attributes in a dataset so that it reduces the risk of re-identifying a data subject in a same quasi-identiﬁer group [73]."
2011.05411,"data, dataset",186,2022-05-14,0,"To overcome such challenges, Federated Learning (FL), proposed by Google researchers in 2016, has appeared as a promising solution and attracted attention from both industry and academia [70, 71, 81, 80]. Generally, FL is a technique to implement an ML algorithm in decentralised collaborative learning settings wherein the algorithm is executed on multiple local datasets stored at isolated data sources (i.e., local nodes) such as smart phones, tablet, PCs, and wearable devices without the need for collecting and processing the training data at a centralised data server. FL allows local nodes to collaboratively train a shared ML model while retaining both training dataset and computation at internal sites [70]. Only results of the training (i.e., parameters) are exchanged at a certain frequency, which requires a central server to coordinate the training process (centralised FL) or utilises a peer-to-peer underlying network infrastructure (i.e., decentralised FL) to aggregate the training results and calculate the global model."
2011.05411,"data, dataset",199,2022-05-14,0,"In this regard, FL is an alternative for the cloud-centric ML technique that facilitates an ML model to be trained collaboratively while retaining original personal data on their devices, thus potentially mitigates data privacy-related vulnerabilities. It is a cross-disciplinary technique covering multiple computer science aspects including ML, distributed computing, data privacy and security that enables end-users’ devices (i.e., local nodes) to locally train a shared ML model on local data. Only parameters in the training process are exchanged for the model aggregation and updates. The diﬀerence between FL and the standard distributed learning is that in distributed learning, local training datasets in compute nodes are assumed to be independent and identically distributed data (IID) whose their sizes are roughly the same. FL is, thus, as an advancement of distributed learning as it is designed to work with unbalanced and non-independent identically-distributed data (non-IID) whose sizes may span several orders of magnitude. Such heterogeneous datasets are resided at a massive number of scattering mobile devices under unstable connectivity and limited communication bandwidth [81, 80, 65]."

An FL system is not an exception. Generally, if the training data is poorly collected or intentionally prejudicial and fed to an ML, including FL, system, the results apparently turn out to be biased. If the trained model is then utilised for an automated decision-making system, then it probably leads to discrimination and injustice. Furthermore, the nature of preventing service providers from accessing original training dataset as well as the inability to inspect individuals’ locally trained ML model due to Secure Aggregation mechanism ampliﬁes the lack of transparency and fairness in FL systems. As a result, an FL system ﬁnds it problematic to transparently execute the training operations as well as to ensure any automated decisions from the system are impartially performed.

This approach is diﬀerent from the batch-level one, which aims at protecting a single data point in a training task. The proposed method utilises a similar concept of privacy accounting from [1] that allows a coordination server to monitor the accumulated privacy budget by observing the moment accountant and privacy loss proposed in [1]. The training process is halted once the accumulated privacy budget reaches a pre-deﬁned threshold, implying that the privacy guarantee is no further tolerated. The Gaussian mechanism is also used to generate random noise which is then added to distort the sum of gradients updates to protect the whole training data. The proposed method has been experimented on MNIST dataset, and the results show that with a suﬃciently large number of participants (e.g., about 10,000 clients), the accuracy of the FL trained model almost achieves as high as the nondiﬀerential-privacy baseline while a certain level of privacy guarantee over the local training data still holds."

Furthermore, for all three models, SR→ 0 when 1 − 𝛼 → 1 since the SINR at Bob and Eve drops to zero. As anticipated from sections III-B2a and III-B2c, high SR values are obtained, i.e., low decoding performance at Eve, when she has the same capabilities as Bob, and when she only knows her own channel.

On the other hand, however, they seem to be performing worse in the other two driving traces (i.e., SprintB and VerizonB) by an average testing MAE percentage of ≈ 15%. This ﬁnding veriﬁes the fact that bidirectional LSTM networks are very dependant on the respective dataset underlying characteristics. Therefore, the question of whether or not they are ﬁtting for a given application can only be answered after systematic empirical analysis."
2011.10563,dataset,193,2022-05-16,0,"Tables 4 and 5 provide additional insights with respect to the RT complexity. In particular, each row reports the RT [min] per trace and across the available conﬁgurations. In average, we observe that RSBD present a higher RT of ≈ 54% when compared to the RSV L. The above result is not balanced across the two datasets due to the randomness bias during the hyperparameter selection process. For example, instances of the algorithm where higher values for HLs or neurons are selected will require more computational power to accomplish. On the other hand, the average increase in RT between BOAV L and RSV L reaches to a percentage of ≈ 154%, which can be attributed to the following. First, since BOA leverages the Bayes Theorem for minimizing the gradient descent error, it requires more time to reach to a good solution, opposed to RS which randomly scans the search space. And second, the R BOA implementation is not optimized to run on top of a GPU, which adds to the RT overhead."

Note that these hyperparameters was prior optimized (e.g., by means of sensitivity analysis or by using indicative values based on previous experience with datasets of similar nature) on the same dataset [30]. LSTM experimentation takes place in a per-trace fashion, i.e., the ﬁrst x% part of the sequence is used for training and validation, while the remaining y% is used for testing. In addition, we adopt a walk-forward validation, or else, rolling forecast approach, where each prediction value is used as new input to the model for forecasting the next step. Last, we overcome the random LSTM weights initialization bias by repeating each baseline experiment 25 times and reporting the median values for both of our error metrics8. Toward Performance Optimization: We repeat the experimental campaign by enabling hyperparameter optimization while testing the available LSTM variants.

In section II we start by describing a representative network that we use to illustrate the methodology to calculate latency bounds. Section III explains the analytical results behind these calculations. Section IV presents the analysis of the representative network. Section V discusses a free-rider principle which states that a fast network designed to transport the signals from cameras and other high data rate sensors can transport the ﬂows from CAN buses and other slow sources for free. Section VI explains a simple method to derive bounds on the latency and storage of fast ﬂows. Section VIII summarizes the main points of the paper and gives hints on which future in vehicle network architectures may beneﬁt from this work.

We examine the latency and memory utilization when links are designed to have a line rate equal to 125% of the peak bandwidth of data required, independent from the standardized Ethernet modes of operation. That is, we design the links so that their maximum utilization is 80%. We consider the case when the processor only sends slow trafﬁc to fast devices (e.g., cameras), as it it the situation that corresponds to the slowest links which might result in larger latency and memory occupancy. In particular, we assume that the processor can send at most a burst of 4 packets of 512 bits to a given camera. The delay of these four packets on the 10Mb/s link attached to the camera is then at least 4 × 512/(10Mb/s) = 200µs."

A further building block to allow this data convergence, which can be observed in the telecommunications business for quite some years already, is the only recent availability of multi-Gb/s Ethernet physical layer links for application inside a vehicle.

2012.11723,data,219,2022-05-16,0,"Due to the very different approaches of OEMs towards their product strategy and resulting network architectures, we need to classify them based on more abstract concepts in order to compare them. The most common starting point is and was a functional clustering. Here electronic control units (ECUs) which are generally related in their functionality and thereby often designed within the same organizational branch of the OEM [29] are connected together directly, offering only very limited interfaces to systems of other functional clusters. Such clusters may for example be the engine, the drive train, or the infotainment system. The theoretical extreme of this is often described as a domain-based system. How these different functional clusters or domains interact is very different for different OEMs. As the need to exchange data between domains has increased, e.g., to avoid duplication of expensive sensors in constrained packaging spaces, the so-called zonal model has gained much attention. In the zonal architecture the focus lies on integrating different functionalities onto a smaller set of ECUs, which share access to sensors and actuators.

The policing veriﬁes that the source is not misbehaving, such as a faulty switch that thinks it is being pushed every millisecond. The shaping separates the packets by the maximum gap consistent with the deadline to deliver a group of packets or with the rate of a stream or ﬁle transfer. For instance, say that a camera produces 2400 packets of 1500 Bytes every 16 milliseconds and that one wishes to deliver these 2400 packets in about 12 milliseconds. Then, the bridge transmits one packet every 12ms/2400 = 5µs. As another example, a bridge for a 5G antenna could send one 1500 Byte sized packet every 10µs to carry a data rate of 1.2Gb/s. Thus, every source of trafﬁc is shaped, including best effort sources.

For example, a viewpoint in the Archives of Disease in Childhood (Munro and Faust, 2020), is entitled “Children are not COVID-19 super spreaders: time to go back to school”. The title appears to be inflated by the urgent need for policy decisions. The authors write “At the current time, children do not appear to be super spreaders. Serosurveillance data will not be available to confirm or refute these findings prior to the urgent policy decisions that need to be taken in the next few weeks such as how and when to reopen schools.” They continue “Governments worldwide should allow all children back to school regardless of comorbidities. Detailed surveillance will be needed to confirm the safety of this approach, despite recent analysis demonstrating the ineffectiveness of school closures in the recent past (Viner et al. 2020b). The media highlight of a possible rare new Kawasaki-like vasculitis that may or may not be due to SARS-CoV2 does not change the fact that severe COVID-19 is as rare as many other serious infection syndromes in children that do not cause schools to be closed”.

Particularly Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) are commonly assigned to scientific publications to univocally identify scientific documents across databases and the web-at-large.

2102.03237,"data, database",259,2022-05-16,0,"Another group of studies has relied on third-party data sources that control the accuracy of researcher information. For example, Kawashima and Tomizawa (2015) evaluated the disambiguation performance of SCOPUS on a list of 75,405 Japanese author names in 573,338 papers. For this, they used the Database of Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKEN) that maintains a unique ID number of a funded researcher in Japan with a list of her/his verified publications. An author name instance in a SCOPUSindexed paper was compared to each KAKEN researcher profile by comparing name strings, publication records, and affiliations. If a match was found, the KAKEN researcher ID was assigned to the author name instance. Such a record linking technique has been used in other studies to label name instances of Italian researchers (D'Angelo, Giuffrida, & Abramo, 2011) and Dutch researchers (Reijnhoudt, Costas, Noyons, Borner, & Scharnhorst, 2014) using each nation’s administrative scholarly databases. Other sources for labeling include NIH-funded researcher profiles2 (e.g., K. Kim, Sefid, Weinberg, & Giles, 2018; Lerchenmueller & Sorenson, 2016; Liu et al., 2014; Torvik & Smalheiser, 2009) and Highly Cited Researchers data3 (e.g., Liu et al., 2014; Torvik & Smalheiser, 2009).

Ferreira, Gonçalves, & Laender, 2012; Müller et al., 2017). For those who need to mine ambiguous bibliographic data that represent diverse fields, ORCIDlinkage can be an effective way to generate labeled data for their ad-hoc disambiguation tasks."

Our comparisons across three different types of linked labeled data showed that , ORCID-linked labeled data could captured the aspects of Author-ity2009’s performance that were also identified in the other two datasets. This means ORCID linkage can be used as an alternative to other labeling methods if they are unavailable. In addition, ORCID-linkage can be used to help researchers evaluate the labeling quality of other labeled data. Out of 312,951 instances in AUT-NIH, for example, a total of 32,131 instances were also linked to 3,578 ORCID ids.

As name ambiguity in bibliographic data tends to increase with data size (Fegley & Torvik, 2013; J. Kim, 2017), AUT-ORC might be naturally more ambiguous than AUT-NIH. Other differences between these datasets may result from the data sources from which they were drawn. AUT-NIH relied on funded PI information. So, the name instances that could be labelled were restricted to those of researchers who have ever received funds from NIH, a group likely to be more prominent and more homogenous than science itself.

2102.03237,"data, dataset",196,2022-05-16,0,"English name instances constitute the majority in AUT-NIH (diagonal-line bar, 54.53%), while other ethnicities are heavily underrepresented compared to their ratios in Author-ity2009. This might be because AUT-NIH is created based on information of PIs who have ever received funds from NIH in the U.S. Non-US investigators are generally ineligible to apply for NIH funds, so it makes sense that the name instance distribution in this dataset would skew toward English names. This English-skewed distribution is also confirmed in Lerchenmueller and Sorenson (2016) who found that 84% of all ethnicity-identified instances in the whole Author-ity2009 linked to NIH ExPORTER are ‘Caucasian’ (including many European names as well as English). Meanwhile, many instances in self-citation relation are also English (horizontal-line bar; 34.65%) but the ratio differences of other ethnicities against Authority2009 are smaller compared to those in AUT-ORC and AUT-NIH. As such, three labeled data are common in that English name instances are prevalent but none of them represents well the ethnicity distribution in Author-ity2009 because some ethnicities are over-represented while others underrepresented."

2102.03237,"data, dataset",217,2022-05-16,0,"This study also creates a benchmark labeled dataset by linking Author-ty2009 with Principal Investigator (PI) information recorded in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded research data (ExPORTER). This NIH-linkage has been used in several studies to evaluate author name disambiguation for MEDLINE because ExPORTER provides the PMIDs of research papers in MEDLINE that result from NIH funds (e.g., K. Kim, Sefid, & Giles, 2017; K. Kim et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2014; Torvik & Smalheiser, 2009). After an Author-ity2009 paper’s PMID is found to be associated with a specific NIH grant, the author names in the paper are compared to the names of the PI who received the funding. If a PI’s name is found to match an author name, her/his unique NIH PI ID is assigned to the author name as a label. This study reuses the list of NIH PI IDs linked to the Author-ity2009 in Lerchenmueller and Sorenson (2016)13. To make this NIH-linked labeled data (AUT-NIH) comparable to AUT-ORC, each name instance in AUTNIH is assigned an ethnicity and a gender using Ethnea and Genni each."
2102.03237,"data, dataset",227,2022-05-16,0,"Block Size Distribution: Another way to discover how three labeled datasets represent Author-ity2009 is to compare the distributions of block sizes in each dataset. A common practice in author name disambiguation research is to collect author name instances into a block if they match on the full surname and first forename initial. Comparisons that support disambiguation are then performed within blocks (K. Kim et al., 2018). Many studies have used the block size distribution to characterize labeled data (e.g., J. Kim et al., 2019; Levin et al., 2012; Müller, Reitz, & Roy, 2017; Torvik & Smalheiser, 2009). Block sizes can become huge because labeled data contain a few hundreds of thousands (AUT-NIH) or millions (AUT-ORC) of name instances. So, block size distributions are plotted using a cumulative density function on log-log axes. Figure 5 visualizes the block size distributions in AUT-ORC and AUT-NIH. Note that AUT-SCT cannot produce a block size distribution because self-citation pairs only contain match information at the pair level and, thus, the matching status of name instance pairs that are not in self-citation relation but that may nevertheless fall within a block defined by surname and first initial are still unknown."
2102.03237,"data, dataset",253,2022-05-16,0,"Gender Distribution: To provide another indicator of how well each labelled dataset represents Authority2009, we turn to comparisons of the gender composition of author name instances. Figure 3 shows that the majority of name instances in all datasets are male (black bar; 57%) while female instances (22.32%) and NULL (i.e., gender unidentifiable) instances (20.28%) make up the rest with similar percentages. Such an imbalanced gender distribution is broadly characteristic of scientific authorship in general (Larivière, Ni, Gingras, Cronin, & Sugimoto, 2013) as of biomedical science (Jagsi et al., 2006). The gender imbalance is also observed in AUT-ORC (gray bar) in which male names constitute 67.46 percent of all name instances while the percentage of female instances (22.70%) is quite similar to that in Autority2009. The higher ratio of male instances in AUT-ORC than in Author-ity2009 seems to be a trade-off with the reduced ratio of Null name instances. The same pattern is observed in AUT-NIH and AUT-SCT in which the dominance of male names are more prevalent (i.e., 73.95% and 65.44% each) than in Autority2009 and AUT-ORC but with lower ratios of Null names and similar ratios of female names. These observations indicate that despite the minute differences in gender ratios, three labeled data shared similar patterns of gender distribution."
2102.03237,"data, dataset",272,2022-05-16,0,"The answers to these questions can help disambiguation researchers to make informed choices of labeled data and to create evaluation and ground-truth datasets at scale. Several studies have attempted to answer similar questions by discussing how ORCID profiles represent the author population in Web of Science (Youtie, Carley, Porter, & Shapira, 2017), what issues need to be addressed before ORCID can be used as a gold standard for author disambiguation (Albusac, de Campos, Fernández-Luna, & Huete, 2018; Eichenlaub & Morgan, 2017), and how record-linkage-based labeling may or may not work in author disambiguation under certain conditions (Anderson A Ferreira, Gonçalves, & Laender, 2020; Reijnhoudt et al., 2014). This study contributes to that growing literature by demonstrating the use of ORCID-linked labeling against another large-scale disambiguated dataset constructed using different linkage-based labeling methods. Specifically, this study labels name instances in MEDLINE by linking them with ORCID researcher profiles. Then, the performances of Author-ity2009 which disambiguates MEDLINE author names, is evaluated using the labeled data. For comparison, two labeled datasets are created using two widely-used sources - NIH-funded researcher information and self-citation information. The three labeled datasets are compared for their representativeness of Author-ity2009 as well as to evaluate results of the Author-ity2009’s disambiguation performances. After that, a discussion follows about the implications and challenges of using ORCID for labeling. In the following section, labeling procedures via record-linkage for Author-ity2009 are described in detail."
2102.03237,"data, dataset",319,2022-05-16,0,"In Figure 5a, the block size distributions of Author-ity2009 (blue circles) and AUT-ORC (green x-markers) are compared. Both distributions are highly skewed: most blocks are small while a few are huge. In Author-ity2009, for example, blocks with 12 or fewer instances make up 80% of all blocks, while in AUT-ORC, blocks with 20 or fewer do so. But they begin to differ as the block size increases over those 80% thresholds. The curvature of AUT-ORC turns downward more than that of Author-ity2009. This means that in AUT-ORC, large blocks make up a smaller proportion of AUT-ORC than they do inAuthor-ity2009. To see if this difference naturally occurs due to different data sizes (AUTORC ≈ 3M vs Author-ity2009 ≈ 40M), we randomly select a set of Athor-ity2009 name instances of the same general size as AUT-ORC (i.e., 3M). Their block size distribution is depicted on the figure in red. As shown in Figure 5a, the random data’s block size distribution (red triangles) has a different shape from AUT-ORC’s, while it has a similar curvature as that of Author-ity2009. This implies that the block size distribution in AUT-ORC is biased toward small sizes when compared to its population data, Authority2009. The same pattern is also observed for AUT-NIH in Figure 5b. Both these distances may be due to the relatively larger European focus of ORCID and the US focus of NIH data. The largest name blocks in Author-ity2009 tend to be created by highly ambiguous Asian name instances. If the distributions of both labeled datasets were representative of Author-ity2009, we would expect to see their distributions track closely with those of the random subset of Author-ity2009 name instances."

Note that other labeled data may have the same verification problems. Human experts can produce inaccurate labels and often disagree on labeling decisions even given the same information (Shin et al., 2014; Song et al., 2015). Although NIH PI data are curated with special care by NIH, the linkage process for labeling may entail erroneous matching between PI names and author names in NIH-funded papers. As shown above regarding the labeling quality of AUT-NIH (see 3rd paragraph in Conclusion and Discussion), ORCID-linked data provided more accurate labeling results than the other method but still contained erroneous labels.

They can be used together with other labeled data for triangulating a disambiguation method’s performance. Unlike selfcitation-based labeled data, ORCID-linked labeled data can be used to measure both clustering and classification performances. Unlike NIH-linked labeled data, ORCID-linked labeled data contain a greater range of ambiguous names across ethnicities, which can enable a disambiguation method to be evaluated on name instances with different ambiguity levels. This in turn allows for more focused analysis to address difficult disambiguation tasks such as those presented by synonyms and homonyms. Moreover, ORCID-linkage can produce labeled instances that are challenging to disambiguate but are not easily collectable by other labeling methods. For example, FINI could not reach perfect recall in AUT-ORC (Figure 6a and Figure 7a). As detailed above (see Clustering Performance: AUT-ORC and AUT-NIH), 273,782 name instances of 12,646 authors (= unique ORCID ids) are recorded in a way that their ‘surname + first forename initial’ strings of the same author are different. This means ORCID-linkage could produce labeled name instances that refer to the same authors but do not belong to the same blocks. Such synonymous name variants existing across blocks have been insufficiently studied in disambiguation research (Backes, 2018; Gomide et al., 2017) because many studies have created labeled data by collecting (= blocking) ambiguous name instances sharing at least the full surname and first forename initial (J. Kim, 2018; Müller et al., 2017). Using ORCID-linked labeled data, scholars can develop disambiguation models that address synonyms as well as homonyms."

2102.03237,"data, dataset, publicly available, data available",130,2022-05-16,0,"This study suggests several implications for researchers and practitioners of author name disambiguation. First, ORCID can be an effective source of authority for creating labeled data. This study illustrated that ORCID-linkage can generate millions of labeled name instances in a bibliographic data, which is not easily achievable by manual or other record-linkage-based labeling. In addition, ORCID-linkage can be repeated without much additional cost once technical procedures for record-linkage are implemented. Moreover, ORCID data continue to be expanded, publicly available, and released annually. This means labeled data via ORCID-linkage can be improved in representing the population of a whole disambiguated dataset and updated on a regular basis, enabling sustained evaluation of author name disambiguation in ever-growing digital libraries."
2102.03237,"data, publicly available",169,2022-05-16,1,"Author-ity2009 is chosen as an evaluation target for three reasons. First, Author-ity2009 conducts author name disambiguation on a digital library scale: 61.7M name instances in 18.6M papers published between 1966~2009 as indexed in MEDLINE. Evaluating disambiguation results for such a large bibliographic corpus can be a daunting challenge. So, Author-ity2009 can be a good use case to illustrate how ORCIDlinkage can contribute to the performance and evaluation of an important, large-scale disambiguation task. Second, the performance of Author-ity2009 have been evaluated on different types of labeled data in several studies (e.g., J. Kim, 2019b; Lerchenmueller & Sorenson, 2016; Liu et al., 2014; Torvik & Smalheiser, 2009), as summarized in Table 1. This provides a context for comparing ORCID with other labeling sources to better understand its strengths and weaknesses.

As such, ORCID-linkage can be used as a labeling method to produce large-scale truth data to evaluate the performance of a disambiguation method from various aspects. Three large-scale labeled data – AUTORC, AUT-NIH, and AUT-SCT – used in this study are publicly available17.

This study suggests that the open researcher profile system, ORCID, can be used as an authority source to label name instances at scale. This study demonstrates the potential by evaluating the disambiguation performances of Author-ity2009 (which algorithmically disambiguates author names in MEDLINE) using 3 million name instances that are automatically labeled through linkage to 5 million ORCID researcher profiles. Results show that although ORCID-linked labeled data do not effectively represent the population of name instances in Author-ity2009, they do effectively capture the ‘high precision over high recall’ performances of Author-ity2009. In addition, ORCID-linked labeled data can provide nuanced details about the Author-ity2009’s performance when name instances are evaluated within and across ethnicity categories. As ORCID continues to be expanded to include more researchers, labeled data via ORCID-linkage can be improved in representing the population of a whole disambiguated data and updated on a regular basis. This can benefit author name disambiguation researchers and practitioners who need large-scale labeled data but lack resources for manual labeling or access to other authority sources for linkage-based labeling.

Author-ity2009 is a bibliographic database that contains disambiguated author names in MEDLINE5, the world’s largest digital library of biomedical research, maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM). In Author-ity2009, author names are disambiguated in two steps. First, name pairs are compared for similarity over various features such as middle name initial, coauthor name, affiliation, and Medical Subject Headings. Next, the instance pairs are grouped into clusters by a maximum-likelihood-based, hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm using the pairwise similarity calculated in the first step."

2102.03237,dataset,158,2022-05-16,0,"Other differences between labeled datasets also help illuminate particular strengths and weaknesses in Author-ity2019. AUT-ORC and AUT-NIH have different levels of name ambiguity. When the Authority2009’s performance was compared with two commonly-used baseline methods, it was less impressive on AUT-NIH where simpler the baseline methods accomplished equivalently high precision and recall to the more sophisticated Author-ity2009. In contrast, in AUT-ORC, the performance gaps between Authority2009 and baseline methods widened substantially. Considering that the baseline methods are deterministic (matching name instances on full surname and initialized forename), their strong performances mean that (1) while many name instances in AUT-ORC and AUT-NIH are not ambiguous, (2) AUT-ORC contains more ambiguous names than AUT-NIH. We observed the same patterns in comparisons of performance across groups of ethnic name instances known to vary in their ambiguity (Figure 7 and Figure 8)."
2102.03237,dataset,161,2022-05-16,0,"Clustering Measure: To assess the performances of Author-ity2009 on three labeled datasets, author name instances referring to the same author are grouped into a cluster. Specifically, a truth cluster is the collection of author name instances that share the same ORCID ID (AUT-ORC) or the same NIH PI ID (AUT-NIH). Meanwhile, a predicted cluster is the collection of author name instances that share the same Author-ity2009 ID (AUT-ORC and AUT-NIH). Then, the predicted cluster is compared to the truth cluster to quantify how well it contains only and all instances that belong to the truth cluster. This study uses B-Cubed (B3), one of most frequently used clustering metrics in author name disambiguation (J. Kim, 2019a). This measure is comprised of three metrics: B3 Recall, B3 Precision, and B3 F1, which are defined as follows:"
2102.03237,dataset,255,2022-05-16,0,"As reported above, three labeled datasets together highlight different aspects of Author-ity2009’s disambiguation performance. They all showed that Author-ity2009 is highly accurate in disambiguating author name instances. It demonstrated special strength in distinguishing author name instances that belong to different authors and in producing almost perfect clustering precision (AUT-ORC and AUTNIH). In addition, Author-ity2009 performed well in finding name instances of unique authors, producing very high clustering recall (> 0.96; AUT-ORC and AUT-NIH) and classification accuracy (= 98.06%; AUT-SCT) scores. Note that the Author-ty2009 is by design aimed to disambiguate with high precision because incorrectly matched name instances (merged author identities created by false positives) are more harmful than wrongly mismatched ones (split author identities created by false negatives) for bibliometric analyses (Fegley & Torvik, 2013; Liu et al., 2014; Torvik & Smalheiser, 2009). The evaluation results described so far strongly suggest that Author-ity2009 achieved its stated precision-over-recall goals. Using the name instances stratified into different ethnic groups, the three labeled datasets discussed here provide a deeper understanding of Author-ity2009’s disambiguation performance. Author-ity2009 achieved high precision regardless of ethnic name types (AUT-ORC and AUT-NIH). But its recall was relatively weak in disambiguating some ethnic names, when compared with baseline performances (AUTORC, AUT-NIH, and AUT-SCT), suggesting possibilities to improve the algorithm."
2102.03237,dataset,303,2022-05-16,0,"Another benchmark labeled dataset is a list of name instance pairs that represent self-citation relations. This self-citation information has been used in several studies to develop and test automatic labeling methods (e.g., J. Kim, 2018; J. Kim et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2014; Schulz, Mazloumian, Petersen, Penner, & Helbing, 2014; Torvik & Smalheiser, 2009). This labeling method is based on the assumption that if a paper cites another and they have the same author names, those names refer to the same author. To generate a list of citing references for a paper, reference lists of papers in MELDINE are connected to their cited papers via matching PMIDs. Then, author names in a cited paper are compared to those in citing papers. Following the common practice using this labeling method, if two name instances in cited and citing papers each match on the full surname and the first forename initial, we treat them as instances of the same author. More than 6.2M self-citation pairs are detected in Author-ity2009. To be comparable to AUT-ORC and AUT-NIH, each name instance in a self-citation pair is assigned an ethnicity and a gender, too. Table 3 characterizes the sources of record linkage and labeling methods of the three labeled datasets – AUT-ORC, AUT-NIH, and AUT-SCT – and presents the numbers of labeled instances and unique authors in each dataset. Note that the number of unique authors is unavailable for AUT-SCT because only name instances that have self-citation relationships can be labelled. It is thus impossible to know from this dataset alone whether name instances without self-citation refer to the same author.14."
2102.03237,dataset,327,2022-05-16,0,"To evaluate the disambiguation performances of Author-ity2009, author name instances disambiguated by Author-ity2009 need to be labeled. This study attempts to link ORCID ids to 40M author name instances that appear in about 9M papers published between 1991 and 2009 in Author-ity2009. Author-ity2009 disambiguates author name instances in MEDLINE but does not provide their raw name strings. So, this study proceeds from the whole MEDLINE corpus (2016 baseline version) retrieved from the National Library of Medicine repository7. We select MEDLINE records for papers published between 1991 and 2009 (MEDLINE2009) to align with the publication year range of Author-ity2009. Next, name instances in MEDLINE2009 are compared to the author profiles in ORICD. For this MEDLINE2009-ORCID linkage, a 2018 ORCID release version is used8. To find author name instances recorded in both MEDLINE2009 and ORCID, paper titles with five or more words in MEDLINE2009 are encoded into ASCII format, deprived of non-alphabetical characters, and lowercased. Any duplicate titles after the preprocessing are removed. Then, each title (which is associated with a unique PMID) is compared to the publication lists in ORCID researcher profiles. If a match is found between bibliographic records in MEDLINE2009 and ORCID, author name strings that appear in the matched MEDLINE2009 paper are compared with the name string of the ORCID researcher whose list of publications contains the matched title. If two name strings in MEDLINE2009 and ORCID are matched on the full surname plus the first forename initial, they are assumed to refer to the same author and the ORCID ID of the matched researcher profile is assigned to the name instance in MEDLINE2009. As shown in Figure 1, this matching process produces a labeled dataset, MED-ORC, in which an author name instance in a MEDLINE paper is associated with an ORCID ID."

This is consistent with our benchmark results since Stan came closest to FastAD for this operation (see Section 5.3). It is also consistent with how it is implemented, since they allocate extra memory for double values for each matrix and the multiplication is carried out with these matrices of primitive types. However, this vectorization does come at a cost of at least 4 times extra memory allocation than what FastAD allocates. Moreover, the backward-evaluation requires heap-allocating a matrix on-the-ﬂy every time. FastAD incurs no such cost, only allocates what is needed, and never heap-allocates during AD evaluation."

In particular, the exponential function eh reuses its forward-evaluated result, and many log-pdfs cache the log of its parameters such as log(σ) in the Normal log-pdfs and log(γ) in the Cauchy log-pdfs (σ, γ are the second parameters of their respective distributions, which are constant in this model). Note that this caching is automatically done in FastAD, which would be tedious to manually code for the baseline. Hence, this shows that due to automatic caching, FastAD forward and backward-evaluation combined can be faster than a manually-written forward evaluation only, which puts FastAD at an optimal performance."
2102.03681,code,167,2022-05-16,0,"One example is choosing the correct specialization of an operation depending on the shapes of the input. As seen in Section 4.1, all nodes are given a shape trait. Depending on the input shapes, one may need to invoke diﬀerent routines for the same node. For example, the normal log-pdf node behaves quite diﬀerently depending on whether the variance parameter is a scalar σ2 or a (covariance) matrix Σ. Namely, if the variance has a matrix shape, we must perform a matrix inverse to compute the log-pdf, which requires a diﬀerent code from the scalar case. Using a C++ design pattern called Substitution-Failure-Is-Not-An-Error (SFINAE), we can choose the correct routine at compile-time. The beneﬁt is that there is no time spent during run-time in choosing the routine anymore, whereas in libraries like CppAD, they choose the routines at run-time for every evaluation of the node [2]."

Other libraries did not produce vectorized code."
2102.03681,code,71,2022-05-16,0,"If we assume that the most expensive operation is the matrix multiplication, AD evaluation approximately takes two matrix multiplications between a matrix and a vector. We can then approximate a lower bound for the manually-written gradient computation time to be two times that of the baseline. The relative time of FastAD to this approximated time is 1.1, implying about 10% overhead from a manually-written code."
2102.03681,code,73,2022-05-16,0,"Hence, in total, one AD evaluation requires three matrix multiplications between two K ×K matrices. If we approximate a manually-written gradient computation to take three times as long as the baseline (one multiplication), FastAD time relative to this approximated time is 3.27 3 = 1.09. This shows then that FastAD only has about 9% overhead from a manually-written code, which is extremely optimal."

While the compiler optimization is able to vectorize a user’s code sometimes, it is not guaranteed because vectorization requirements are quite stringent. For example, vectorization is not guaranteed if memory access is not done in a contiguous fashion and is impossible if there is any dependency between loop iterations. This makes it quite challenging to design an AD system that can always predict compiler optimization to create vectorized code. However, vectorization can make AD extremely fast, powerful, and practical even in complex problems. In practice, we come across many examples where operations can be vectorized during gradient computation. For example, matrix multiplication, any reduction from a multi-dimensional variable to a scalar such as summation or product of all elements, and any unary and binary function that is applied element-wise such as exponential, logarithm, power, sin, cos, tan, and the usual arithmetic operators."

It has become critical to ﬁnd automated machine learning techniques to proactively defend against malware. Transformers, a category of attention-based deep learning techniques, have recently shown impressive results in solving different tasks mainly related to the ﬁeld of Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this paper, we propose the use of a Transformers’ architecture to automatically detect malicious software. We propose a model based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) which performs a static analysis on the source code of Android applications using preprocessed features to characterize existing malware and classify it into different representative malware categories. The obtained results are promising and show the high performance obtained by Transformer-based models for malicious software detection."

We model Android malware detection as a binary and a multi-label text classiﬁcation problem and propose a novel feature representation by considering the software applications’ source code as a set of features. We apply text preprocessing on these features to keep the important information like permissions, intents, and activities."

It is a known way of identifying malicious applications among benign applications, and this analysis focuses on the source code of software components that may be affected by malware. It is less expensive in terms of resources and time since no need to activate the malware by executing the code to capture the features, it can identify the maliciousness at the code level. For static analysis, there are mainly three practices to detect"

And in order to on longer sequences, the authors applied dynamic modiﬁcation on the masking scheme [12] applied to the training data. They also collect a new dataset of comparable size to other privately used datasets to better control the effects of training set size."
2103.03806,"data, dataset",161,2022-05-16,0,"This paper studies the challenge of malware classiﬁcation using our novel approach for Transformer-based malware detection. We detailed the malware text classiﬁcation methodology and used it for feature representation. The BERT based model achieved high accuracy results for both binary and cross-category classiﬁcation, compared to the other baseline pre-trained language models. The results from the experiments show that the best binary accuracy is 0.9761 and for the multi-classiﬁcation, it is 0.9102. We can conclude that the proposed approach’s results of feature representation as text input for a Transformer-based model, are very good. So, the implementation of pre-trained linguistic models based on Transformer architectures in cybersecurity tasks can outperform standard RNN models like LSTM, when applied on a state-of-the-art dataset like Androzoo. Future work will therefore consist of testing other models, testing other types of data, and creating an API to detect malware in new applications."

We train BERT to predict Malware/Benign (i.e., binary classiﬁcation) for each sample, then, to predict the categories of malware (i.e, multi-classiﬁcation). The Transformer architecture has speciﬁc input formatting steps including the creation of special tokens and ids. We use the Transformers implementation of the hugging face library [34] for the binary classiﬁcation of Android applications. Only the Transformer architecture, layers, and weights are implemented, while all data formatting must be done beforehand to be compatible with the Transformer. While most pre-trained Transformers have essentially the same steps. Here we test this approach with BERT. Figure 4 gives a detailed overview of our approach."

The dataset includes 11 different malware categories namely adware, spyware, ransomware, clicker, dropper, downloader, riskware, SMS-sender, horse-trojan, backdoor, and banker [9]. Our methodology focuses on the static analysis level on the source code of Android applications, to identify different categories of malware. Indeed, we did not limit the features to permission-based only but considered the whole software code as an important set of feature representation for the analysis. We started with training the model with the features after preprocessing, then a binary classiﬁcation of the apps to malicious and benign, and ﬁnally a cross-category classiﬁcation at the malware level."

Then, we decompiled the downloaded APKs using Jdax [32], which creates folders of the apps’ ﬁles [33]. We extracted the AndroidManifest.xml ﬁle from each sample. The manifest presents essential information about the application to the Android system, information the system must have before it can run any of the application’s code, including the list of permissions, the activities, services, broadcast receivers, content providers, the version, and the meta-data. These ﬁles are then treated as text ﬁles and passed through the preprocessing phase, in this step and to conserve the important information about the features, we apply speciﬁc cleaning of the not important, mostly repeated words, in the code. We manually analyzed different examples and created a list of words and expressions that do not provide additional info, so the cleaning included lexicon removal, punctuation removal and we conserved the digits and the cases of the characters. The purpose of the preprocessing is to reduce the size of the input. The ﬁnal dataset format has 4 columns, the ID column, represented by the APK hash name, the Text column representing the Manifest ﬁles after preprocessing, the Label column, a binary format equal to 1 if the app is malware and 0 if not, and ﬁnally the Category column representing the malware type name (exp: adware)."

2103.13219,"data, dataset",262,2022-05-17,0,"Abstract—Detecting piano pedalling techniques in polyphonic music remains a challenging task in music information retrieval. While other piano-related tasks, such as pitch estimation and onset detection, have seen improvement through applying deep learning methods, little work has been done to develop deep learning models to detect playing techniques. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning approach for the detection of sustainpedal techniques, which are commonly used by pianists to enrich the sound. In the source task, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained for learning spectral and temporal contexts when the sustain pedal is pressed using a large dataset generated by a physical modelling virtual instrument. The CNN is designed and experimented through exploiting the knowledge of piano acoustics and physics. This can achieve an accuracy score of 0.98 in the validation results. In the target task, the knowledge learned from the synthesised data can be transferred to detect the sustain pedal in acoustic piano recordings. A concatenated feature vector using the activations of the trained convolutional layers is extracted from the recordings and classiﬁed into frame-wise pedal press or release. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in acoustic piano recordings of Chopin’s music. From the crossvalidation results, the proposed transfer learning method achieves an average F-measure of 0.89 and an overall performance of 0.84 obtained using the micro-averaged F-measure. These results outperform applying the pre-trained CNN model directly or the model with a ﬁne-tuned last layer."

DATASET For the source task, pedal and no-pedal versions of music excerpts are required to train a convnet, which is able to highlight the spectral or temporal characteristics that change with the sustain pedal instead of note events. For this reason, 1392 MIDI ﬁles publicly available from the Minnesota International Piano-e-Competition website1 were downloaded. They were recorded using a Yamaha Disklavier piano from the performance of skilled competitors. To render these MIDI ﬁles into high quality audio, the Pianoteq 6 PRO2 software was used. This physically modelled virtual instrument approved by Steinway & Sons can export audio using models of different instruments and recording conditions. We employed the Steinway Model D grand piano instrument and the closemiking recording mode. Audio with or without sustain-pedal effect was then generated with a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz and a resolution of 24 bits. These were rendered while preserving or removing the sustain-pedal message in the MIDI data. For each pedal-version audio, we can obtain the temporal regions when the sustain pedal is on or off by thresholding the MIDI message at 64 given its range of [0,127]. A pedalled segment is determined to start at a pedal onset (where the pedal state changes from off to on) and ﬁnish when the state returns to off. We can clip all the pedalled segments to form the pedal excerpts. The start and end times of the pedalled segments were also used to obtain no-pedal excerpts from the corresponding no-pedal-version of the audio."

2103.13219,"dataset, used dataset",321,2022-05-17,0,"In this paper, we focus on detecting the technique of the sustain pedal, which is the most frequently used one among the three standard piano pedals. All dampers are lifted off the strings when the sustain pedal is pressed. This mechanism helps to sustain the current sounding notes and allows strings associated to other notes to vibrate due to coupling via the bridge. A phenomenon known as sympathetic resonance [1] is thereby enhanced and embraced by pianists to create a “dreamy” sound effect. We can observe how the phenomenon reﬂects on the melspectrogram in Figure 1, where note F4 is played without (ﬁrst) and with (second) the sustain pedal in two bars respectively. Note that the symbol under the second bar of the music score in Figure 1 can be used to indicate the sustain-pedal techniques. Yet, even if pedal notations are provided, pedalling in the same piano passage can be executed in many different ways. Playing techniques are typically adjusted to the performer’s sense of tempo, dynamics, as well as the location where the performance takes place [2]. Given that detecting pedalling nuances from the audio signal alone is a rather challenging task [3], several measurement systems have been developed to capture the pedal movement. For instance, the Yamaha Disklavier piano can encode this movement into MIDI messages (0-127) along with note events. A dedicated system proposed in [4] enables synchronously recording the pedalling gestures and the piano sound. This can be deployed on common acoustic pianos, and it is used to provide the ground truth dataset introduced in Section III. Detection of pedalling techniques from audio recordings is necessary in the cases where installing sensors on the piano is"

By learning at the local scale (a voxel in our case) instead of the whole scene, LIDF can generalize to unseen objects because different objects may share similar local structures. 3) Voxel grids provide a natural partition of the 3D space. By deﬁning implicit function on ray-voxel pairs, we can signiﬁcantly reduce the inference time as the model only needs to consider occupied voxels intersected by the camera ray. Based on these motivations, we present a model to estimate the depth of a pixel by learning the relationship between the camera ray and its intersecting voxels given the color and local depth information. To further utilize the geometry of transparent object itself, we propose a depth reﬁnement model to update the prediction iteratively by combining the input RGB, input depth points and the predicted depth from LIDF. To train the whole pipeline, we create a large scale synthetic dataset, Omiverse Object dataset, using the NVIDIA Omniverse platform [2]. Our dataset provides over 60,000 images including both transparent and opaque objects in different scenes.

2104.00622,dataset,309,2022-05-17,0,"Depth estimation. Depth estimation can be classiﬁed into three categories based on the input. Several methods have been proposed to directly regress the depth map from the color image using convolutional neural networks [14, 44, 27, 8, 16, 17, 19]. Most of them are trained on large scale datasets generated from RGB-D cameras, thus they can only reproduce the raw depth scan. Our method, on the contrary, focuses on the depth estimation for transparent objects where depth sensor typically fails. Another line of related work explores the task of depth completion given RGB images and sparse sets of depth measurements [33, 9, 43, 53, 11, 38]. These works improve the depth estimation over color-only methods, but they still produce low quality results because of limited information provided by sparse depth. Our method falls into the third category which tries to complete depth maps given noisy RGB-D images. Barron and Malik [4] propose a joint optimization for intrinsic images. Firman et al. [15] predict unobserved voxels from a single depth image using the voxlet representation. Matsuo and Aoki [34] reconstruct depths by ray-tracing to estimated local tangents. Recent works [56, 46] estimate surface normals and occlusion boundaries only from color images using deep networks and solve a global optimization based on those predictions as well as observed depths. The optimization is very slow and produces bad results if the network predictions are not accurate. We address these limitations by learning a implicit function using color and local depth jointly. Experiment shows that our method can achieve better results and 20× speedup compared to [46]."

Via an ablation study we show that the jointly trained model obtains more effective latent feature representations by using the joint loss along with both the train- and test-time augmentations. We compare our proposed end-to-end method with the state-of-the-art on several social network datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed method, AugInf-GAT, can improve the performance of predicting social inﬂuence on a number of social networks, and in particular, on the smallest of the social network graphs."

Most calibration methods rely on hand-crafted features and require signiﬁcant amounts of extracted features or speciﬁc calibration targets. With the development of deep learning (DL) techniques, some attempts take advantage of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to regress the 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) extrinsic parameters. Nevertheless, the performance of these DL-based methods is reported to be worse than the non-DL methods. This paper proposed an online LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration algorithm that combines the DL and the geometry methods. We deﬁne a two-channel image named calibration ﬂow to illustrate the deviation from the initial projection to the ground truth. EPnP algorithm within the RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) scheme is applied to estimate the extrinsic parameters with 2D-3D correspondences constructed by the calibration ﬂow. Experiments on KITTI datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we propose a semantic initialization algorithm with the introduction of instance centroids (ICs). The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/LvXudong-HIT/CFNet."

The off-range of the test dataset T3 is a litter smaller than that in dataset T2. The metric MSEE for β-RegNet and RGGNet is smaller in T3 than in T2. Nevertheless, the MSEE is the same for CFNet in these two test datasets, which proves that CFNet is more robust than βRegNet and RGGNet with different off-range settings. In test dataset T4, the performance of β-RegNet degrades heavily, and RGGNet needs to re-train on an additional dataset by adding a small number of data from 2009 10 03 sequence to achieve a good calibration result 0.010 (83.22%). CFNet does not need any additional training dataset and re-train process. The calibration results 0.001 (98.08%) demonstrates that CFNet has good generalization capability. Thus, FNet outperforms all of the learning-based calibration algorithms, RegNet, CalibNet, RGGNet, and even the motion-based calibration method. We can also see that, compared to the motion-based algorithm [30], our proposed method is more generalized, without the requirements of hand-crafted features or the extra IMU sensor. Furthermore, the semantic initialization process does not require motion information which is vital to the hand-eye calibration."

2105.00129,code,334,2022-05-17,0,"Addressing these challenges requires a solid experimental methodology for evaluating and benchmarking workﬂow algorithms and systems. A fundamental component of this methodology is the availability of sets of representative workﬂow instances. One approach is to infer workﬂow structures from real-world execution logs. We have ourselves followed this approach in previous work [4], [5], resulting in a repository that provides ∼20 workﬂow instances for each of a handful of scientiﬁc applications. These instances have been used by researchers, often for driving simulation experiments designed to evaluate scheduling and resource management algorithms. Real workﬂow instances are by deﬁnition representative of real applications, but they cover only a limited number of scenarios. To overcome this limitation, in previous work we have developed tools for generating synthetic workﬂows by extrapolating the patterns seen in real workﬂow instances. The work in [4] presented a synthetic workﬂow generator for four workﬂow applications, which has been used extensively by researchers3. The method for generating the synthetic workﬂows was ad-hoc and based on expert knowledge and manual inspection of real workﬂow instances. Our more recent generator in [5] improves on the previous generator by using information derived from statistical analysis of execution logs. It was shown to generate more realistic workﬂows than the earlier generator, and in particular to preserve key workﬂow features when generating workﬂows at different scales [5]. The main drawback of these two generators is that implementing the workﬂow generation procedure is labor-intensive. Generators are manually crafted for each application, which not only requires signiﬁcant development effort (several hundreds of lines of code) but also, and more importantly, expert knowledge about the scientiﬁc application semantics that deﬁne workﬂow structures. As a result, this approach is not scalable if synthetic workﬂow instances are to be generated for a large number of scientiﬁc applications."

The Reynolds number is defined as Re = U∞c U∞ is the incoming freestream speed and ν is the kinematic viscosity. The convective and diffusion terms of the partial differential equations are time-integrated using second-order accurate Adams-Bashforth and Crank-Nicolson methods, respectively. We enforce a Dirichlet condition (streamwise velocity set to the freestream speed U∞) on all boundaries, except at the outlet where we use a convective boundary condition (to carry vortical structures outside the computational domain). Our code base, PetIBM, solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using a projection method, seen as an approximate block-LU decomposition of the fully discretized equations.6 To compute the flow around a moving object (e.g., a pitching-rolling wing), we use an immersed boundary technique. The fluid equations are solved over an extended domain that includes the interior of the immersed object. The boundary of the object is represented by a collection of Lagrangian markers that moves with a prescribed rigid kinematics and on which we enforce a no-slip condition. The presence of the body in the domain is taken into account by modifying the fluid equations in the vicinity of its boundary. This approach enables us to solve the equations on a simple fixed structured Cartesian grid. Different near-boundary treatments lead to different immersed boundary methods. The original study used a sharp-interface method with a ghost-cell methodology.7 PetIBM employs regularized delta functions to transfer data between the Lagrangian markers and the Eulerian grid points (on which the fluid equations are solved)."

Statistical robustness ensures estimation efﬁciency at the Gaussian and non-Gaussian probability distributions, including heavy-tailed distributions. The proposed RDMD is statistically robust because the outliers in the data set are ﬂagged via projection statistics and suppressed using a Schweppe-type Huber generalized maximum-likelihood estimator that minimizes a convex Huber cost function. The latter is solved using the iteratively reweighted least-squares algorithm that is known to exhibit a better convergence property and numerical stability than the Newton algorithms.

2105.09869,"data, dataset",192,2022-05-17,0,"It turns out that solving the sensitivity of DMD to deviations from the assumptions made about the data set is a challenging task [20] due to the vulnerability of the least-squares estimator to non-Gaussian noise and outliers, which is a great concern to practitioners. This fact motivated several independent investigations to assess the accuracy of the DMD in capturing the underlying system dynamics directly from the data set [21]–[24]. For instance, Dawson et al. [25] and Hemati et al. [26] address, respectively, the bias introduced by Gaussian noise and the bias resultant from asymmetrically processing snapshots. In Section IV of this paper, numerical experiments conﬁrm that the DMD variant proposed by Hemati et al. [26] has excellent performance in the presence of Gaussian noise and has good performance in the presence of non-Gaussian but symmetrically distributed noise. This is achieved thanks to a reformulation of the DMD using a total least-squares estimator [27]; however, this estimator is still vulnerable to outliers."
2105.09869,"data, dataset",224,2022-05-17,0,"The vulnerability of the least-squares estimator to outliers is not directly solvable without data preprocessing; therefore, Askham et al. [28] reformulate DMD as an optimization problem and make use of a least trimmed squares (LTS) estimator, speciﬁcally the trimmed M-estimator introduced by Rousseeuw [29]. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, [28] is the only formulation of DMD that makes use of a robust estimator. In particular, the LTS estimator has a high breakdown point [29]—that is, this estimator is very robust from a statistical standpoint; however, the formulation in [28] lacks a mechanism to identify outliers. Indeed, identifying outliers without access to a system model is challenging but necessary in DMD. The formulation in [28] circumvents this challenge by making a blanket assumption that the time-series data can be represented “by the outer product of a matrix of exponentials, representing Fourier-like time dynamics, and a matrix of coefﬁcients, representing spatial structures.” Consequently, nonexponential dynamics in the data set are, therefore, classiﬁed as outliers. This fact precludes the application of the method proposed in [28] to dynamical systems that present nonexponential dynamics."
2105.09869,"data, dataset",267,2022-05-17,0,"In the classic literature in robust statistics [16], [17], one deﬁnes robustness as insensitivity to deviations from the assumptions. In this sense, the least-squares estimator is not robust. Two cases of deviations from the assumptions are of particular concern. The ﬁrst case arises when the probability distribution of the observations is not Gaussian. The leastsquares estimator quickly loses its statistical efﬁciency (that is, accuracy) when the tails of the probability distribution of the observations become slightly thicker than the Gaussian distribution or when the probability distribution of the observations becomes slightly asymmetric. The second case arises when the probability distribution of the majority of the observations is Gaussian except for a few observations, which may take arbitrary values. In this respect, one deﬁnes an outlier as a data point that violates the underlying assumptions—in other words, it is a data point that is distant from the majority of the point cloud [18]. The least-squares estimator produces strongly biased results in the presence of a single outlier in the data set [19]. Both cases of deviations from the assumptions often occur in practice—for example, when the probability distribution of the observations is not known while being assumed to be Gaussian or when outliers arise because of instrumentation and communications errors or a poor experimental setup. This fact precludes the DMD from being applied to practical settings, especially for control purposes where pre-cleaning the data set is not an option."

2106.03907,"data, data available",245,2022-04-21,0,"One common assumption to cope with confounding bias is to assume no unobserved confounders exist [8], or more generally, the ignorable treatment assignment assumption [28], which states that the treatment assignment is independent of the potential outcomes caused by the treatment, given the background data available. Although a number of methods are proposed based on this assumption [7, 9, 36], it can be too restrictive, since it is often diﬃcult to determine how the confounder aﬀects treatment assignments and outcomes. A less restrictive assumption is that we have access to proxy variables, which contain relevant side information on the confounder. In the ﬂight tickets example, we can use the number of views of the ticket reservation page as a proxy variable, which reﬂects peoples’ desire for ﬂights. Note that if we can completely recover the confounder from proxy variables, the ignorable treatment assignment assumption can be satisﬁed. Motivated by this, Lee et al. [14] and Louizos et al. [17] aim to recover the distribution of confounders from proxy variables using modern machine learning techniques such as generative adversarial networks [5] or variational auto-encoders (VAE) [11].

2106.14178,"dataset, publicly available",228,2022-05-17,1,"Abstract. Location information is proven to beneﬁt the deep learning models on capturing the manifold structure of target objects, and accordingly boosts the accuracy of medical image segmentation. However, most existing methods encode the location information in an implicit way, e.g., the distance transform maps, which describe the relative distance from each pixel to the contour boundary, for the network to learn. These implicit approaches do not fully exploit the position information (i.e., absolute location) of targets. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function, namely residual moment (RM) loss, to explicitly embed the location information of segmentation targets during the training of deep learning networks. Particularly, motivated by image moments, the segmentation prediction map and ground-truth map are weighted by coordinate information. Then our RM loss encourages the networks to maintain the consistency between the two weighted maps, which promotes the segmentation networks to easily locate the targets and extract manifold-structure-related features. We validate the proposed RM loss by conducting extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets, i.e., 2D optic cup and disk segmentation and 3D left atrial segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our RM loss, which signiﬁcantly boosts the accuracy of segmentation networks."

First, the target-speaker-dependent TTS training causes a mismatch between training and conversion, because the speech of the target speaker is used as input to the reference encoder during training but that of the source is used during conversion. A speaker adversarial classiﬁer can alleviate this issue [5, 13] but requires careful hyperparameter tuning. Second, there are scenarios where SPT is not desired, such as emotion VC or accent conversion. In this work, we examine two prosody modeling methods for ASR+TTS-based VC. In addition to SPT, we propose a novel technique, which we refer to as target text prediction (TTP). We borrow the idea from [14] and train a text prediction (TP) module to generate the prosody embedding from the text derived from the source speech. Figure 1b illustrates this process. The TP module is ﬁrst pretrained with a GST-TTS on a multispeaker dataset, and further ﬁne-tuned in a target-speaker-dependent manner. As a result, TTP does not suffer from a mismatch between training and conversion unlike SPT. Our contributions in this work are as follows."

As in [4], thanks to the open-source community, we utilized G2P tools to convert both English and Mandarin text into phonemes, resulting in a better acoustic model and a larger improvement brought about by TTP.

To extract more useful information for boundary prediction, U-shape Edge Network modules are embedded in each decoder units. Besides, the additional down-sampling module alleviates the location inaccuracy. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the validity and reliability of the proposed method.

Linear reductions are used for all semantics [4]. For the ideal extension, the reduction requires the union of all admissible extensions of the input graph; such a set is computed by means of iterative calls to CIRCUMSCRIPTINO. The communication between PYGLAF and CIRCUMSCRIPTINO is handled in the simplest possible way, that is, via stream processing. This design choice is principally motivated by the fact that the communication is often minimal, limited to a single invocation of the circumscription solver."

1607.0085,python,150,2022-07-06,0,"5 CONCLUSIONS In this paper we show that it is possible to write a very good solver for direct numerical simulations of turbulent ﬂows directly in Python, with nothing more than standard modules like NumPy, SciPy and MPI for Python (mpi4py). We also show that it is possible to get a fully competitive solver, that runs with the speed of C on thousands of processors with billions of unknowns, but then it is necessary to move a few computationally heavy routines from NumPy’s ufuncs to Cython or Numba. The current paper discusses only the triply periodic domain, suitable for studying isotropic turbulence. However, the use of Python/Cython for studying turbulence is not limited to only this conﬁguration and work is currently in progress to develop efﬁcient Python/Cython solvers for ﬂows with one or two inhomogeneous directions."

Since the FFT is known to scale with problem size as N log2 N, and assuming further that FFT is the major cost, the ideal weak scaling computing to log2 N. The upper time should then scale proportional panel of Figure 2, shows the scaling of the scientiﬁc Python solver, both with slab and pencil decomposition, compared also with the C++ solver. The slab solver uses mesh sizes of N = (2, 16, 128, 1024), whereas the pencil solver uses mesh sizes of N = (4, 32, 256, 2048). The scientiﬁc Python solver is evidently 30-40 % slower, but scaling is good - indicating that the MPI communications are performing at the level of C++. The lower panel of Figure 2 shows the performance of the solver when certain routines, most notably the cross product and the for-loop in the routines fftn_mpi/ifftn_mpi, have been computed with Cython. The results show that the Python solver now operates very close to the speed of pure C++, and the scaling is equally good. Note that the largest simulations in Figure 2 are using a computational box of size 20483 - approximately 8 billion mesh nodes."

From then on, several different architectures have been proposed that have shown massive success using many different benchmark datasets including MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and many more. Of the DCNN architectures, AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), VGG (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014), NiN (Lin et al., 2013), the All Convolutional Network (Springenberg et al., 2014), GoogleNet (Szegedy et al., 2015), Inception-v4 (He et al., 2016a; Szegedy et al., 2016a), and Residual Networks(He et al., 2016b) can be considered the most popular architectures due to their improved performance on different benchmarks for object classiﬁcation. In 2012, Alex Krizhevesky et al. proposed an improved version of a CNN model compared to LeNet (LeCun et al., 1998), and won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2012.

The intension of most recently developed DCNNs is to use Inception and Residual networks to implement larger deep networks. As the model becomes larger and deeper, the computational parameters of the architecture are increased dramatically. As a result, training the model becomes increasingly complex and thus, more computationally expensive. It is very challenging to include a recurrent property within popular Inception architectures, but recurrence is essential for improving the overall training and testing accuracy with fewer computational parameters. Others are trying to implement bigger and deeper DCNN architectures like GoogleNet (Szegedy et al., 2015), or a residual network with 1001 layers (He et al., 2016a) that achieves high recognition accuracy on different benchmark datasets.

The recomputation time is normalized by the average execution time of individual iterations of the main loop in CG. The number of iterations on the top of each column is the number of iteration we lose because of the crash. the recomputation cost becomes smaller when we use a larger input problem size. When the input problem size is small (Classes S and W), the recompaution time is relatively large. We lose all of the iterations (15 iterations) when the crash happens.

However, we do not see big performance loss (no bigger than 8.2%) in our evaluation. The reason is as follows. Given a large matrix size n × n, the matrix multiplication based on the submatrix multiplication in the original code causes similar cache misses as the new algorithm, because both of the original code and the new algorithm fetch different submatrices for multiplication and save the results in either C f or Cs. Those submatrices multiplications, which dominates the computation time, have “streaming-like” memory access patterns — we need to fetch submatrices one by one for multiplication. Such memory access patterns cause similar cache misses in the original code and the new algorithm. Furthermore, the regular memory access patterns in matrix multiplication allows prefetching to take effect and further alleviate the effects of cache misses."

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for three algorithms, including an iterative solver, dense matrix multiplication, and Monte-Carlo simulation. Based on comprehensive performance evaluation on a variety of test environments, we demonstrate that our approach has very small runtime overhead (at most 8.2% and less than 3% in most cases), much smaller than that of traditional checkpoint, while having the same or less recomputation cost."

We use the conjugate algorithm from sparse linear algebra as an example to study the feasibility of this method. Second, we leverage the invariant conditions established by the algorithm-based fault tolerance method (ABFT) to detect data consistence and correctness. It has been shown that ABFT introduces ignorable runtime overhead by slightly embedding extra information (e.g., checksum) into data objects. Using the extra information, we can determine data consistence and correctness when the application crashes, and even correct inconsistent data.

Prediction of the signal strength and fading channel conditions enable adaptive data transmission which turn enhances the QoS for the end users/ devices with reducing the power consumption for data transmissions. UAV is data gathering robot from the difficult or impossible area for humans to reach. Hence, Atmospheric dynamics and environment influence the signal strength during traveling in space among UAV, IoT devices, and humankind. Therefore, Signal moving from the smart UAV is sensitive to the effects of attenuation, reflection, diffraction, scattering, and shadowing. Also, we analyze the ability ANN to predictively estimate the signal strength and channel propagation from the drone and physical medium parameters. Moreover, the results show that the distortion of the signal can be reduced and enhanced significantly. Keywords: Signal Strength prediction, ANN, UAV, QoS, Devices connectivity"

Such an interpreted implementation need not be fast, merely possible. Simpler semantics are generally better as they reduce the cognitive load on the user of the programming language. All code generated by the compiler should then operate as if following the dynamic semantics, but ideally much faster. In Julia, the local dynamic semantics of the base language are as follows:"

This work suggests that it is possible to not only compile a number of ML models written in Julia to TPUs, but also more general non-ML Julia code (as long as such code is also dominated by linear algebra operations).

Julia is semantically a very dynamic language. However, in standard conﬁguration, Julia’s ultimate backend compiler is LLVM (Lattner & Adve, 2004) which is a static compiler backend. The Julia compiler needs to bridge the semantic gap between the dynamic semantics of the language to the static semantics of the LLVM representation. To understand this process, we will look at four aspects of the Julia system: The dynamic semantics, the embedding of the static compiler intrinsics, interprocedural type inference and the extraction of static sub graphs. In addition we will look at the interaction of these features with macros and generated functions which will be relevant to the XLA compiler."

In order to be ofﬂoadable to XLA, type inference needs to be able to ﬁgure out every static operand to every HLO instruction as well as the shapes of every dynamic operand. In addition, it needs to be able to constant fold or otherwise eliminate all utility computations that are not expressed in terms of HLO operations. Julia’s type inference includes a number of heuristics that are supposed to prevent excessive time spent in inference when there would be little runtime beneﬁt. However, for ofﬂoading to XLA, these heuristics are mistuned. In addition, parts of Julia’s type inference are not designed to handle such a large number of constants as are required to generate a sufﬁciently high quality XLA embedding. For example, inference results are cached based on the precise, concrete signatures of the operands. In our case, the shapes of operands are part of the signature, thus forcing inference to re-infer every function for every new signature. This could be signiﬁcantly improved if instead of caching concrete signatures, type"

They have powered many of Google’s milestone machine learning achievements in recent years. Google has now made TPUs available for general use on their cloud platform and as of very recently has opened them up further to allow use by non-TensorFlow frontends. We describe a method and implementation for ofﬂoading suitable sections of Julia programs to TPUs via this new API and the Google XLA compiler. Our method is able to completely fuse the forward pass of a VGG19 model expressed as a Julia program into a single TPU executable to be ofﬂoaded to the device. Our method composes well with existing compiler-based automatic differentiation techniques on Julia code, and we are thus able to also automatically obtain the VGG19 backwards pass and similarly ofﬂoad it to the TPU. Targeting TPUs using our compiler, we are able to evaluate the VGG19 forward pass on a batch of 100 images in 0.23s which compares favorably to the 52.4s required for the original model on the CPU. Our implementation is less than 1000 lines of Julia, with no TPU speciﬁc changes made to the core Julia compiler or any other Julia packages."

We use sum as a simple stand in for the loss function. Fortuitously, but not entirely coincidentally, the type inference modiﬁcations we describe in section 6 also improve the precision of type inference to be able to infer through all of the VGG19 backwards pass. As for the forward pass, the total optimized and unoptimized instruction counts are shown in ﬁgure 1. The backwards pass generates signiﬁcantly more XLA instructions than the forward pass. One of the biggest contributors to the instruction bloat is Zygote’s mixed mode broadcast fusion, which computes both the forward pass and the backwards pass in one map kernel. Because XLA currently does not support multiple outputs from one map instruction, the function body gets duplicated across multiple map instructions, which XLA’s DCE then needs to clean up. In general, our compilation process stresses XLA’s handling of the map instruction, because of the prevalance of calls to julia’s map and broadcast functions in generic code. We are in the process of improving XLA’s handling of map to inline mapped computations providing XLA backends with a form of IR more similar to that generated by other frontends."
1810.09868,code,257,2022-07-06,0,"Having implemented type inference, we now have a performant way to implement the semantics described in the ﬁrst two sections. Whenever the interpreter performs a function call, it uses the dynamic type information to perform type inference to discover and infer the largest possible static sub-region of code reachable from this entry point (recall that determining call targets requires type information). We can then hand this sub-region to the compiler and have it generate an efﬁcient version of the entirety of the statically reachable sub-region 2. Whenever the compiler encounters a call for which type inference was unable to determine the call target, it emits a call back into the runtime system (making sure to obey the dynamic semantics at the boundary) to begin the process anew. As such, execution generally proceeds as a chain of relatively large static sub regions, chained together by the runtime system. It is only on the boundaries between these regions that the dynamic semantics are materialized (i.e. values moved to the heap, dynamic method selection performed etc.). The performance of this scheme depends heavily on the size of these static sub-regions, which is highly sensitive to both the quality of the type inference implementation and the semantics of the language. In Julia, these static subregions can easily encompass thousands of functions covering tens of thousands of source lines, without once re-entering the runtime system for method selection."

1902.04574,dataset,186,2022-07-06,0,"Table 2 shows the results for the auxiliary task of question–answer goodness classiﬁcation. The ﬁrst column is the name of the model. It is followed by three columns showing the type of embedding used, the size of the hidden layer, and the number of heads (see Section 3.2). The last column reports the accuracy. Since our dataset is balanced (we generate about 50% positive, and about 50% negative examples), accuracy is a suitable evaluation measure for this task. The top row of the table shows the performance for a majority class baseline. The following lines show the results for our full QANet-based model when using different kinds of embeddings. We can see that contextualized sentence-level embeddings are preferable to using simple word embeddings as in GloVe or token-level ELMo embeddings. Moreover, while token-level ELMo outperforms GloVe when the size of the network is small, there is no much difference when the number of parameters grows (dmodel = 128, #Heads = 8)."
1902.04574,dataset,254,2022-07-06,0,"We can see in Table 3 that the seq2seq model outperforms IR by a margin on all ﬁve evaluation measures, which is consistent with previous results in the literature. What is surprising, however, is the relatively poor performance for the Transformer, which trails behind the seq2seq model on all evaluation measures. We hypothesize that this is due to the Transformer having to learn more parameters as it operates with higher-dimensional word embeddings. Overall, the Transformer is arguably slightly better than the IR model, outperforming it on three of the ﬁve evaluation measures. The last row of Table 3 is not an individual model; it is our re-ranker applied to the top answers returned by the IR model. In particular, we use QANet with Sentence level ELMo (dmodel = 128, #Heads = 8). We took the top-5 answer candidates (the value of 5 was found using cross-validation on the training dataset) from the IR model, and we selected the best answer based on our re-ranker’s scores. We can see that re-ranking yields improvements for all evaluation measures: +1.18 on BLEU@2, +0.93 on ROUGE_L, +1.12 on Embedding Average, +0.67 on Greedy Matching, and +1.64 in Vector Extrema. These results show that we can get sizable performance gains when re-ranking the top-K predictions of a single model; below we will combine multiple models."
1902.04574,"dataset, data",193,2022-07-06,1,"Abstract: Recent advances in deep neural networks, language modeling and language generation have introduced new ideas to the ﬁeld of conversational agents. As a result, deep neural models such as sequence-to-sequence, memory networks, and the Transformer have become key ingredients of state-of-the-art dialog systems. While those models are able to generate meaningful responses even in unseen situations, they need a lot of training data to build a reliable model. Thus, most real-world systems have used traditional approaches based on information retrieval (IR) and even hand-crafted rules, due to their robustness and effectiveness, especially for narrow-focused conversations. Here, we present a method that adapts a deep neural architecture from the domain of machine reading comprehension to re-rank the suggested answers from different models using the question as a context. We train our model using negative sampling based on question–answer pairs from the Twitter Customer Support Dataset. The experimental results show that our re-ranking framework can improve the performance in terms of word overlap and semantics both for individual models as well as for model combinations."
1902.04574,"dataset, open-source data, data available",87,2022-07-06,1,"In early 2018, this situation changed as a new open dataset for Customer Support on Twitter [36] was made available on Kaggle. It contains 3M tweets and replies for twenty big companies such as Amazon, Apple, Uber, Delta, and Spotify, among others. As customer support topics from different organizations are generally unrelated to each other, we focus only on tweets related to Apple support, which represents the largest number of tweets in the corpus."
1902.04574,"dataset, publicly available, data",86,2022-07-06,0,"The data and the resources that could be used to train customer support conversational agents are generally very scarce, as companies keep conversations locked on their own proprietary support systems. This is due to customer privacy concerns and to companies not wanting to make public their know-how and the common issues about their products and services. An extensive 2015 survey on available dialog corpora by Serban et al. [35] found no good publicly available dataset for real-world customer support."

For query generation, SP2Bench [29] proposed a query design system focusing on generating queries with combination of different operations. But this query generation was not designed from a semantic perspective for cross domain. LUBM [30] and BSBM [31] generated benchmarks on university and ecommerce respectively, but neither benchmark was based on more than one domain. FedBench [32] provided a benchmark suite for federated queries on semantic data which can cover semantic multiple domain data use cases. However, query benchmarks were manually generated by authors. Our approach provides a way to automatically help people find the semantic relationship without acquiring knowledge explicitly. MedTQ provided a dynamic topic query generation approach over medical ontologies [33]. BmQGen [34, 35] supported query generation for a specific biomedical detecting task on postsurgical complications [36]. Zhu et al. investigated the usage of the PharmGKB knowledge base for searching and inferring repositioning breast cancer drugs [37]."

Then in second level running of HFCM, only cluster 2 (C2) and cluster 3 (C3) can be further clustered. According to silhouette width, we get the best number of cluster 2 for C2 and 4 for C3 respectively. As a result, after level 2 running, we get 9 different clusters.

To some extent, the speed of data growing in terms of multiple domains is much faster than that of the large amount of knowledge people can acquire and consume in their daily lives. In other words, since cross domain datasets are physically grouped instead of semantically clustered, it is extremely difficult for people without expertise to extract knowledge from various domains nowadays.

We preprocessed the existing AAN dataset [Radev et al., 2013; Radev et al., 2009; Dragomir R.

A technique that could add a reference citation at the appropriate place in a sentence will be beneﬁcial. In this perspective, context-aware citation recommendation has been researched upon for around two decades. Many researchers have utilized the text data called the context sentence, which surrounds the citation tag, and the metadata of the target paper to ﬁnd the appropriate cited research. However, the lack of wellorganized benchmarking datasets and no model that can attain high performance has made the research difﬁcult. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based model and well-organized dataset for contextaware paper citation recommendation. Our model comprises a document encoder and a context encoder, which uses Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) layer and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), which is a pretrained model of textual data. By modifying the related PeerRead dataset, we propose a new dataset called FullTextPeerRead containing context sentences to cited references and paper metadata. To the best of our knowledge, This dataset is the ﬁrst well-organized dataset for context-aware paper recommendation.

Furthermore, word similarity datasets are usually not split into train and test subsets, which may result in overﬁtting if models are optimized to solve only the word similarity tasks of speciﬁc datasets.

Motivated by this observation, the authors present the SimLex-999 dataset, which tries to capture similarity. Furthermore, Hill et al.

The evaluation tool used replaces OOV words with an average vector of all words in the vocabulary, which is a vector with no semantic distinctiveness. In Table 3 the correlation metrics are generally low, caused by the high ratio of word pairs with OOV words. For all datasets thai2vec yields the best results. This is caused by the lower ratio of OOV words. The best results were achieved for TWS-65 with an HM = 0.505.

The three datasets contain 1852 word pairs in total and have different characteristics in terms of difﬁculty, domain coverage, and notion of similarity (relatedness vs. similarity). These features help to gain a broader picture of the properties of an evaluated word embedding model. We include baseline evaluations with existing Thai embedding models, and identify the high ratio of out-of-vocabulary words as one of the biggest challenges. All datasets, evaluation results, and a tool for easy evaluation of new Thai embedding models are available to the NLP community online."
1904.04307,dataset,199,2022-07-06,0,"The peculiarities of Thai written language, such as missing word and sentence boundaries and ﬂexible word order, make it challenging for NLP. The alphabet includes 44 consonants and 15 basic vowels [11]. Compound vowels can be constructed in various ways by combining vowel characters and consonants, and be placed above, below, before or after the consonants. Further complications in Thai NLP include zero anaphora, the absence of upper/lower-case characters, high ambiguity of compound words, and serial verbs [12]. In contrast to English, Thai is a tonal language with ﬁve different tones, making it a very difﬁcult language for English native speakers to comprehend. For this project, the inherent n-gram structure of Thai language had the largest impact on dataset construction and evaluation results. For example, the word forest, which is a unigram in English, is translated to forest-wood in Thai; theater is hall-drama in Thai; or minority is race-group-few in Thai. This ngram characteristic, coupled with missing word boundaries, makes word segmentation a critical step in the preprocessing pipeline."
1904.04307,dataset,207,2022-07-06,0,"relatedness. Similarity refers to synonymy of words or similarity in a number of aspects, whereas relatedness refers to general association. For example “coffee” and “mug” have low similarity, but high relatedness. Some datasets like SimLex-999 provide similarity (synonymy) scores, while others like WordSim-353 provide relatedness scores. Word embedding models are generally better at capturing relatedness than similarity. Some new datasets like SemEval500 (from SemEval 2017) try to integrate both notions into their scoring via the annotator instructions. For rating the similarity values of word pairs, the typical approach is to ask a number of annotators (usually at least 5 per word pair) for a similarity judgment, and then aggregate the results. This also allows for computing annotator agreement to compare datasets, and statistics, which are important to have a human level baseline for automated methods. In our work, we select WordSim-353, SimLex-999 and SemEval-500 for translation to Thai and subsequent rerating. WordSim-353 is well established, but for English language automated methods already reach human level agreement scores. SimLex-999 and SemEval-500 are more recent and challenging datasets."
1904.04307,dataset,238,2022-07-06,0,"and TH-SimLex-999 in Table 4 are similar, overall both datasets include similar word categories. Deeper investigation yields various OOV word categories. Firstly, foreign language proper nouns, are often transliterated preﬁxed with their class, for example Mexico is country+Mexico. In addition, foreign words, when transliterated into Thai, can be spelled differently using different Thai characters while pronouncing exactly the same sound. Most OOV words from TH-WordSim-353 using thai2vec fall into this category. A second category of OOV words are words with long n-gram translations. For example, archive is translated as place+keep+document+important, or OPEC becomes group+country+export+oil. Deepcut is able to segment some of such OOV words into many shorter constituent words. The third category are words which contain a preﬁx. In Thai, the preﬁx การ=verb-preﬁx makes a verb into a noun, and ความ=adjective-preﬁx provides the same function for adjectives. With the preﬁx นัก=person-preﬁx an action or a noun becomes a profession. There is a large number of Thai OOV words in this category, which deepcut can sometimes segment into smaller components. The fourth category of OOV words are technical words, found mostly in the SemEval-500 dataset. Those words are transliterated into Thai with or without a preﬁx. For example, the word Joule is transliterated as is, also the word Hadoop."
1904.04307,dataset,266,2022-07-06,0,"There have been attempts to translate word similarity datasets from their English original to other languages. For Thai there exists little work, except for one project which translated the RG-65 dataset [11] from English to Thai (named TWS-65). For this small dataset, they used a large number of raters (40 Thai native speakers) to assign similarity scores. Osathanunkul et al. evaluate the gold standard dataset against a method based on the structure of WordNet [20]. Regarding other languages, CamachoCollados et al. [2] published the SemEval-500 dataset in ﬁve languages, and Chen and Ma [9] translated SimLex-999 to Chinese. Akhtar et al. [10] translated RG-65 and WordSim353 into six Indian languages. There have been similar efforts for various languages like Croatian [21], Japanese [22], or Russian [23]. Many researchers used manual rating of the word pairs, while others ( [8], [19], [22], [24]) apply crowdsourcing to translate or rate the datasets with the help of paid crowd workers via crowdsourcing platforms. For the translation of the terms itself, the most popular strategy is to employ two translators for the words, which use high-quality dictionaries to support the English language similarity scores can help to understand the meaning of polysemous words in the source language. In cases of disagreement between the two translators, often"
1904.04307,"dataset, data",126,2022-07-06,0,"For scoring the word pairs, we aimed to keep the scores consistent with the original English datasets. We therefore re-used the scoring instructions of the individual English datasets, and the same rating scales (the scales per dataset are described in the description of the English datasets). For the WordSim-353 dataset, 10 native speakers of Thai assigned the similarity scores, for both the SimLex-999 and SemEval-500 scoring was performed by 16 annotators. The annotators rated all word pairs of a dataset. Finally, the resulting scores are computed as the average of the annotator scores. The annotator scoring data for the three new datasets, including some statistical analysis of the scores is available on GitHub2"
1904.04307,"dataset, data",239,2022-07-06,0,"a third expert decided. The similarity between terms was rated by 16 (SimLex-999, SemEval-500), and 10 (WordSim353), resp., native speakers – using the original annotation instructions from the English-language datasets. The ﬁnal datasets include the mean annotator ratings. We also provide the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) as a humanlevel baseline, and other statistical data about the datasets. This results in three novel word similarity datasets for Thai language, with 1852 word pairs in total, and different characteristic (regarding task difﬁculty, domain, relatedness versus similarity) which are inherited from the Englishlanguage original datasets. We evaluate existing pre-trained embedding models with the new datasets in order to provide baseline task scores for Thai word embeddings. One ﬁnding of the evaluations is the large ratio of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words – depending on the embedding model. By default, the evaluation tool represents such words by the average vector of the whole vocabulary. We also implemented another strategy, namely piping OOV words into a Thai tokenization tool, and then representing the word as the sum of in-vocabulary parts (if any). The experiments show good Pearson/Spearman correlation scores for invocabulary words, so besides improving the quality of word representations themselves, the issue of OOV words is important for future work."
1904.04307,"dataset, data",293,2022-07-06,0,"For the translation from English into other languages, many researchers [2], [9], [10] use the strategy of involving two independent translators, and in case of disagreement on the translations, to have a third expert decide – we applied this approach, too, with translators being Thai academics who are ﬂuent in English. As in Camacho-Collados et al. [2], during translation, the annotators were presented the original similarity score of the word pair, in order to help selecting the correct translation for the intended meanings of the words. Translation agreement between the two initial translators per dataset was low, for example on the WordSim-353 dataset, only for 18.5% of pairs the translators produced the exact same translation of the two words. A number of factors lead to the low agreement. Firstly, polysemy in the source language. One example for this in Table 1 is the English word stock, which may refer to company shares, inventory, etc. in English, but the word stock only refer to inventory stock for Thais. In this case, the similarity score in the source language did not help the translators. Secondly, Thai language has speciﬁc constraints and ﬂexibility in word composition. Foreign words can be translated in multiple ways, for example, CD was made into disk+CD by one translator and into disk+record+data by another. In addition, some words have many translations with the exact same meaning, such as the English word king can be translated into a number of different Thai words with exactly the same meaning."

1904.06554,"dataset, benchmark",248,2022-07-06,0,"Tactile texture refers to the tangible feel of a surface and visual texture refers to see the shape or contents of the image. In the image processing, the texture can be defined as a function of spatial variation of the brightness intensity of the pixels. Texture is the main term used to define objects or concepts of a given image. Texture analysis plays an important role in computer vision cases such as object recognition, surface defect detection, pattern recognition, medical image analysis, etc. Since now many approaches have been proposed to describe texture images accurately. Texture analysis methods usually are classified into four categories: statistical methods, structural, model-based and transform- based methods. This paper discusses the various methods used for texture or analysis in details. New researches shows the power of combinational methods for texture analysis, which can't be in specific category. This paper provides a review on well known combinational methods in a specific section with details. This paper counts advantages and disadvantages of well-known texture image descriptors in the result part. Main focus in all of the survived methods is on discrimination performance, computational complexity and resistance to challenges such as noise, rotation, etc. A brief review is also made on the common classifiers used for texture image classification.

For example, relative scour depth increases with increase in  for model proposed by Sharafi et al. (2016) whereas an inverse relationship for these variables with scour depth can be found when the model of Azamathulla et al. (2009) is used. Thus, it can be obtained that the relationship is strongly to data availability and also the applied method. Finally, it is noticed that the coefficient of variables for laboratory and field data differ to some extend even though the models were developed in dimensionless form. Dealing with empirical equations, model simplicity, data availability and computational effort is also of great importance. Moreover, consistency of the relationship with physics of the problem should be taken under consideration."

The main problem, however, is that such systems require signiﬁcant expansion of existing datasets for proper machine learning (Roy and Grangier, 2019). The lack of data still remains the greatest obstacle to the development of a stable generation system which could be lexically rich and insensitive to rare words. E.g., the largest datasets supplied with proper annotation seldom exceed 100K samples in size. The authors of the aforementioned articles claim that any user generated content is valuable even though noisy to a certain extent. We propose a solution which overcomes the given problem, and it is based on the denoising procedure which has recently attracted growing attention. We argue that automatically matched and ranked datasets can be used for paraphrase generation task, especially in low-resource languages, by providing experimental results obtained on the Russian Opusparcus subcorpus and on the novel ParaPhraser Plus corpus."

2010.00763,benchmark,220,2022-07-06,0,"To simplify the process, we use only two classes of base actions: line and arc. As each base action has three arguments: moving type, moving length and moving angle, an action is depicted by a function: [action_name]([moving_type], [moving_length], [moving_angle]), as shown in Figure 2c. Speciﬁcally for the above arguments, there are ﬁve moving types, including normal, zigzag, triangle, circle, and square. For instance, normal means the line or arc is perfectly straight or curved, zigzag means the line or arc is of the zigzagged-style and triangle means the line or arc is formed by a set of triangles. Besides, both moving length and moving angle are normalized into the range of [0, 1], where 0 and 1 correspond to the minimal and maximal values, respectively. Depending on varying lengths of action programs, different combinations of these base actions form visually distinct shapes. Our benchmark contains different types of shapes, as discussed in Section 2.1, each of which requires a separate procedure in the LOGO language to generate, and we leave generation details in Appendix A."

To familiarize the human subjects with BONGARD-LOGO problems, we describe each problem type and provide detailed instructions on how to solve these problems. It normally takes 30-60 minutes for human subjects to fully digest the instructions. Depending on the total time that a human subject spends on digesting instructions and completing all tasks, we have split 12 human subjects into two evenly distributed groups: Human (Expert) who well understand and carefully follow the instructions, and Human (Amateur) who quickly skim the instructions or do not follow them at all."
2010.00763,benchmark,266,2022-07-06,0,"Abstract reasoning benchmarks In addition to popular machine perception benchmarks that focus on categorization and detection [1, 2], there have been previous efforts in creating new benchmarks for abstract reasoning, including compositional visual question answering [7], physical reasoning [42–44], mathematics problems [45], and general artiﬁcial intelligence [46]. Most relevant to our benchmark, the Raven-style Progressive Matrices (RPMs) [47], a well-known human IQ, have inspired researchers to design new abstract reasoning benchmarks [17, 48]. Our benchmark is complementary to RPMs: RPMs focus on relational concepts (such as progression, XOR, etc.) while BONGARD-LOGO problems focus on object concepts (such as stroke types, abstract attributes, etc.). In RPMs, the relational concepts come from a small set of ﬁve relations [17]. In our benchmark, the object concepts can vary arbitrarily with procedural generation. Recently, [49] has proposed V-RPM that extends RPMs to real images. As V-PROM is a real image version of RPMs, it differs from our benchmark in the similar ways described above. Therefore, in contrast to RPMs where automated pattern recognition models have achieved competitive performances [50, 17], our BONGARD-LOGO benchmark has posed a greater challenge to current models due to its fundamental shift towards more human-like (i.e., context-based, analogy-making, few-shot with inﬁnite vocabulary) visual cognition."
2010.00763,"data, benchmark",246,2022-07-06,0,"Humans have an inherent ability to learn novel concepts from only a few samples and generalize these concepts to different situations. Even though today’s machine learning models excel with a plethora of training data on standard recognition tasks, a considerable gap exists between machine-level pattern recognition and human-level concept learning. To narrow this gap, the Bongard problems (BPs) were introduced as an inspirational challenge for visual cognition in intelligent systems. Despite new advances in representation learning and learning to learn, BPs remain a daunting challenge for modern AI. Inspired by the original one hundred BPs, we propose a new benchmark BONGARD-LOGO for human-level concept learning and reasoning. We develop a program-guided generation technique to produce a large set of human-interpretable visual cognition problems in actionoriented LOGO language. Our benchmark captures three core properties of human cognition: 1) context-dependent perception, in which the same object may have disparate interpretations given different contexts; 2) analogy-making perception, in which some meaningful concepts are traded off for other meaningful concepts; and 3) perception with a few samples but inﬁnite vocabulary. In experiments, we show that the state-of-the-art deep learning methods perform substantially worse than human subjects, implying that they fail to capture core human cognition properties.

To evaluate the capability of the CNN backbone on our visual stimuli, regardless of the concept learning and reasoning aspects, we train a standard supervised recognition task with a training set of the visual inputs sampled from our benchmark. In particular, we train two separate binary attribute classiﬁers for convex and have_two_parts, respectively, using the same ResNet-15 backbone as in the paper. With each dataset of randomly sampled 14K positive and 14K negative samples, the model achieved the near-perfect train/test accuracies 98.7%/97.0% on convex and 98.0%/97.1% on have_two_parts.

To enable the scalable generation of Bongard-style problems, we develop a program-guided shape generation technique to produce human-interpretable visual pattern recognition problems in action-oriented LOGO language [16], where each visual pattern is generated by executing a sequence of program instructions. These problems are designed to capture the key properties of human cognition exhibited in original BPs, including 1) context-dependent perception, in which the same object may have fundamentally different interpretations given different contexts; 2) analogy-making perception, in which some meaningful concepts are traded off for other meaningful concepts; and 3) perception with a few samples but inﬁnite vocabulary.

An overview of our framework is shown in Figure 2. In the data collection stage, we take advantage of the classiﬁer head in a pre-trained object detector, which has high conﬁdence when the object is viewed unoccluded in a common pose. The conﬁdence values of the pre-trained detector serve as a cue to help us select good views of objects in the agent’s environment. Although the conﬁdence of a detector is not always well-calibrated with its accuracy, we are able to maintain high precision by setting a strict conﬁdence threshold (see supp. for more details). In the pseudo-label generation stage, we propagate the high-conﬁdence detections from “easy” views to “hard” views. We then ﬁne-tune the 2D object detector using generated pseudo-labels. We demonstrate large improvements in both indoor and outdoor benchmarks. Additionally, we train a 3D detector from scratch using the pseudo-labels. Experimental results are discussed in Section 4."

We also ablate the effectiveness of our reﬁnement stage with CRF, reporting the performance both with and without CRF reﬁnement. We perform this experiment on CARLA training set to evaluate the resulting pseudo-label quality. The results are shown in Table 8. We observe that PointNet improves marginally compared to the SVM alone, while being about 280× slower. Adding CRF reﬁnement stage signiﬁcantly improves SVM, while only marginally improving PointNet. Therefore, we show that our two-stage 3D segmentation method is simple, fast, and effective. It is important to note that training a single PointNet on many P ’s from many episodes might yield better performance for such a deep model, but that requires many more episodes of data collection. In contrast, our method operates on each episode separately and generates high-quality pseudo-labels even in the low-data regime."

This poses a grand challenge to existing blind image quality assessment (BIQA) models, which are weak at adapting to subpopulation shift. Recent work suggests training BIQA methods on the combination of all available human-rated IQA datasets. However, this type of approach is not scalable to a large number of datasets and is cumbersome to incorporate a newly created dataset as well. In this paper, we formulate continual learning for BIQA, where a model learns continually from a stream of IQA datasets, building on what was learned from previously seen data. We ﬁrst identify ﬁve desiderata in the continual setting with three criteria to quantify the prediction accuracy, plasticity, and stability, respectively. We then propose a simple yet effective continual learning method for BIQA. Speciﬁcally, based on a shared backbone network, we add a prediction head for a new dataset and enforce a regularizer to allow all prediction heads to evolve with new data while being resistant to catastrophic forgetting of old data. We compute the overall quality score by a weighted summation of predictions from all heads. Extensive experiments demonstrate the promise of the proposed continual learning method in comparison to standard training techniques for BIQA, with and without experience replay.

These metrics allow us to quantify the similarities in structure of the blood pressure waveforms. This is implemented for the entire test dataset (150 minutes, 900 samples at 10 sec/sample) and a random sample of the validation dataset of equal size."

Therefore from a quantitative perspective, we compute DTW, RMSE error, and PCC of the real vs. generated continuous ABP signals. The time series similarity results on the validation and test datasets for both the federated and un-federated frameworks are displayed in Table 1 below. It can be seen that, as expected, the federated results are degraded slightly compared to the non-federated results. In both cases, the models perform seemly equal on the validation dataset as they do on the test dataset."

This not only puts a massive strain on the lives of those affected but also on the public healthcare systems. To understand the dynamics of the healthy and unhealthy heart doctors commonly use electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood pressure (BP) readings. These methods are often quite invasive, in particular when continuous arterial blood pressure (ABP) readings are taken and not to mention very costly. Using machine learning methods we seek to develop a framework that is capable of inferring ABP from a single optical photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor alone. We train our framework across distributed models and data sources to mimic a large-scale distributed collaborative learning experiment that could be implemented across low-cost wearables. Our time series-to-time series generative adversarial network (T2TGAN) is capable of high-quality continuous ABP generation from a PPG signal with a mean error of 2.54mmHg and a standard deviation of 23.7mmHg when estimating mean arterial pressure on a previously unseen, noisy, independent dataset. To our knowledge, this framework is the ﬁrst example of a GAN capable of continuous ABP generation from an input PPG signal that also uses a federated learning methodology."
2102.12245,"dataset, data",311,2022-07-06,0,"To successfully evaluate our model we examine the mean arterial pressure (MAP) of generated samples. Using a completely independent test dataset from the training dataset grants us the freedom to implement a leave-one-out strategy and see how well our model generalises to other ABP-PPG datasets. We take the PPG measurements from the test dataset and pass them through our trained global deterministic function; P2A. This function converts our PPG signal to a corresponding ABP signal and we then calculate the MAP from the generated signal and compare it with the true MAP measurements from the real ABP signal. MAP is considered a better indicator of perfusion to vital organs than systolic blood pressure (SBP) [22]. It is important to note that we can retrieve the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from the P2A signal which we use to calculate the MAP (2) rather than simply returning the mean of the continuous signal segment. We also present the Bland-Altman (BA) plots of the MAP error [23] that allow us to determine to what degree the generated ABP is a good substitute for the real ABP. The Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard requires BP measuring methods to have a mean error (µ) and standard deviation (σ) of less than 5mmHg and 8mmHg respectively [24]. Following this, we then select the entire 150-minute period of the test-data and perform calibration on this data for the ﬁrst one-minute period only. This calibration is designed to remove user bias and provide more accurate results while mimicking a continuous BP measurement test that can be performed clinically. Bland-Altman plots are provided for the calibrated and uncalibrated measurements."

2103.04329,benchmark,207,2022-07-06,0,"Abstract— This letter presents a novel framework termed DistSTN for the task of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR). In contrast to the conventional SAR ATR algorithms, DistSTN considers a more challenging practical scenario for non-cooperative targets whose aspect angles for training are incomplete and limited in a partial range while those of testing samples are unlimited. To address this issue, instead of learning the pose invariant features, DistSTN newly involves an elaborated feature disentangling model to separate the learned pose factors of a SAR target from the identity ones so that they can independently control the representation process of the target image. To disentangle the explainable pose factors, we develop a pose discrepancy spatial transformer module in DistSTN to characterize the intrinsic transformation between the factors of two different targets with an explicit geometric model. Furthermore, DistSTN develops an amortized inference scheme that enables efﬁcient feature extraction and recognition using an encoder-decoder mechanism. Experimental results with the moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition (MSTAR) benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Compared with the other ATR algorithms, DistSTN can achieve higher recognition accuracy."

We also exploit data augmentation trick of generating some pseudo targets to form a full aspect angle training set. It will be used to train A-ConvNet, yielding another variant termed A-ConvNet*.

This paper explores a novel method to realize this goal in the context of dynamic difﬁculty adjustment (DDA). Here the aim is to constantly adapt the content of a game to the skill level of the player, keeping them engaged by avoiding states that are either too difﬁcult or too easy. Current systems for DDA rely on expensive data mining, or on handcrafted rules designed for particular domains, and usually adapts to keep players in the ﬂow, leaving no room for the designer to present content that is purposefully easy or difﬁcult. This paper presents Fast Bayesian Content Adaption (FBCA), a system for DDA that is agnostic to the domain and that can target particular difﬁculties. We deploy this framework in two different domains: the puzzle game Sudoku, and a simple Roguelike game. By modifying the acquisition function’s optimization, we are reliably able to present a content with a bespoke difﬁculty for players with different skill levels in less than ﬁve iterations for Sudoku and ﬁfteen iterations for the simple Roguelike. Our method signiﬁcantly outperforms simpler DDA heuristics with the added beneﬁt of maintaining a model of the user.

We consider a typical collaborative learning setting of the genomics supply chain, where data may come from hospitals, collaborative projects, or research institutes to a central cloud without awareness of bias against a sensitive group. In this context, we develop a methodology to leak potential bias information of the collective data without hampering the genuine performance using ML backdooring catered for genomic applications. Using a real-world cancer dataset, we analyze the dataset with the bias that already existed towards white individuals and also introduced biases in datasets artificially, and our experimental result show that TRAPDOOR can detect the presence of dataset bias with 100% accuracy, and furthermore can also extract the extent of bias by recovering the percentage with a small error."
2108.10132,"dataset, data",179,2022-07-06,0,"7 CONCLUDING REMARKS In this work, we study bias detection from the perspective of a genomics dataset, since bias in genomics datasets may give rise to unfair predictions and severe societal implications. Dataset bias in collaborative genomics may stay hidden as the data consolidated at the cloud is from several sources, who may themselves be unaware of the bias. To facilitate detection of this dynamic bias, we re-purpose the seemingly malicious machine learning trojans. We develop a methodology to first enable backdooring of small models (logistic regression) trained on genomic datasets and then further advance it to create a mechanism to detect bias automatically using double backdooring. We create several sub-datasets with different sample percentages to evaluate our methodology for bias detection. Finally, we investigate the possibility of leaking the extent of bias for gender and race attributes in a real world genomics dataset from iDash20 competition, and detect that the original dataset given at the competition was in fact biased with regards to race."

We hereby present a work which intends to investigate and analyse the use of Deep Learning (DL) techniques to extract information from such images and allow to classify them, trying to keep our methodology as general as possible and possibly also usable in a real world scenario without much effort, in the future. To move in this direction, we trained several β-Variational Autoencoder (β-VAE) models on the CheXpert dataset, one of the largest publicly available collection of labeled CXR images; from these models, latent features have been extracted and used to train other Machine Learning models, able to classify the original images from the features extracted by the β-VAE. Lastly, tree-based models have been combined together in ensemblings to improve the results without the necessity of further training or models engineering. Expecting some drop in pure performance with the respect to state of the art classiﬁcation speciﬁc models, we obtained encouraging results, which show the viability of our approach and the usability of the high level features extracted by the autoencoders for classiﬁcation tasks."

To do so, we passed the validation set to each of VAE to create datasets made of embeddings, to be fed to the ML models. In order to tune the many hyperparameters of these models, we used a grid search approach on several of them. In particular, for tree based architectures we optimised the maximum depth of the trees, which balances accuracy and overﬁtting tendencies; the minimum number of samples to allow the split of an internal tree node; the minimum number of samples required for a node to become a leaf; the number of estimators in the ensembles. Table II show the results of parameters tuning for treebased methods; for KNN we tuned the number of neighbours, achieving best performances with k = 10 . To train the ML models, the dataset built from embeddings extracted from the validation set have been used; the same extraction process has been applied to the test dataset.To build and train the ML models, SciKit Learn [35] library has been used."

Two different PNG formats are provided, high and normal quality, with the former being 16-bit while the latter only 8-bit. A 14 class label accompanies each image, identifying what is in the image according to the radiology report. The main peculiarity of CheXpert is the automatic labeling method used, able to interpret the radiology report and extract the relevant information to assign the correct classes. Positive, negative and uncertain are the possible values, according to the conﬁdence level of the labeler, which are encoded in a vector of 14 elements, respectively, 1, 0, u. The main type of images available is frontal images, with the possibility, usually where the report was uncertain and therefore an uncertain value for the label is more likely, to ﬁnd also lateral ones.

There are some notable observations: Firstly, the performance of the pipeline methods is far from satisfactory. Although both adopting BERT as the backbone, the uniﬁed methods (e.g., TASO-BERT Linear) perform much better than the pipeline ones (e.g., HGCN-BERT + BERT-Linear). This veriﬁes our assumption that the pipeline solutions tend to accumulate errors from the sub-task models and ﬁnally affect the performance of the ﬁnal quad prediction. Secondly, among the uniﬁed methods, GAS outperforms two variants of TASO by a large margin, showing the effectiveness of the sequenceto-sequence modeling for the ASQP task. Besides, to solve the task in a uniﬁed manner, TASO expands the dataset to |Vc| × |Vp| times the original size, leading to large computation costs and training time. Thirdly, we can see that our proposed method, PARAPHRASE modeling achieves the best performance on all metrics across two datasets. Our method tackles the ASQP problem in an end-to-end manner, alleviating the possible error propagation in the pipeline solutions. Moreover, compared with the GAS method using the same pre-trained model, our PARAPHRASE also achieves superior results, suggesting that constructing target sequence in the natural language form is a better way for utilizing the knowledge from the pre-trained generative model, thus leading to better performance."

In this work, we introduce the Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction (ASQP) task, aiming to jointly detect all sentiment elements in quads for a given opinionated sentence, which can reveal a more comprehensive and complete aspect-level sentiment structure. We further propose a novel PARAPHRASE modeling paradigm to cast the ASQP task to a paraphrase generation process. On one hand, the generation formulation allows solving ASQP in an end-to-end manner, alleviating the potential error propagation in the pipeline solution. On the other hand, the semantics of the sentiment elements can be fully exploited by learning to generate them in the natural language form.

As these models are quite recent in the Computer Vision field, there is a need to study it’s transfer learning capabilities and compare it with CNNs so that we can understand which architecture is better when applied to real world problems with small data. In this work, we follow a simple yet re- strictive method for fine-tuning both CNN and Transformer models pretrained on ImageNet1K on CIFAR-10 and com- pare them with each other. We only unfreeze the last trans- former/encoder or last convolutional block of a model and freeze all the layers before it while adding a simple MLP at the end for classification.

We try to find out if the models still perform well with a simple bilinear interpolation to the low resolution images.

But NFNetF6 has 12 Million train- able parameters which is significantly larger than the 7 Mil- lion trainable parameters of the DenseNet201. NFNetF6 also has a total number of parameters including trainable and non-trainable parameters, equal to approximately 450 Million[3] which is much larger than DenseNet201 with 18 Million total parameters.

As for  the EfficientNetV2L, only accuracy of 90.13% is achieved with a number of parameters similar to DenseNet201.

This study investigates the efﬁcient abdominal organ segmentation topic and compares several lightweight network-based and knowledge distillation methods on the WORD dataset. Firstly, we compare three lightweight segmentation networks’ performance in abdominal organ segmentation, ESPNet [34], DMFNet [4] and LCOVNet [55]. ESPNet [34] proposed an efﬁcient spatial pyramid block for high-speed brain tumour segmentation. DMFNet [4] combined point-wise [54], groupwise [9] and atrous [6] convolutions to reduce the computational cost and boost brain tumour segmentation performance.

The recent multimodal fusion schemes customize LSTMs to discover intramodal dynamics and design sophisticated attention mechanisms to discover the inter-modal dynamics from multimodal sequences. Although powerful, these schemes completely rely on attention mechanisms which is problematic due to two major drawbacks 1) deceptive attention masks, and 2) training dynamics. Nevertheless, strenuous efforts are required to optimize hyperparameters of these consolidate architectures, in particular their custom-designed LSTMs constrained by attention schemes. In this research, we ﬁrst propose a common network to discover both intra-modal and inter-modal dynamics by utilizing basic LSTMs and tensor based convolution networks. We then propose unique networks to encapsulate temporal-granularity among the modalities which is essential while extracting information within asynchronous sequences. We then integrate these two kinds of information via a fusion layer and call our novel multimodal fusion scheme as Deep-HOSeq (Deep network with higher order Common and Unique Sequence information).

Previous experiments on early Slavic dependency parsing are discussed, particularly with regard to their ability to tackle different orthographic, regional and stylistic features. A generic pre-modern Slavic parser and two specialized parsers –one for East Slavic and one for South Slavic– are trained using jPTDP [8], a neural network model for joint part-of-speech (POS) tagging and dependency parsing which had shown promising results on a number of Universal Dependency (UD) treebanks, including Old Church Slavonic (OCS). With these experiments, a new state of the art is obtained for both OCS (83.79% unlabelled attachment score (UAS) and 78.43% labelled attachement score (LAS)) and Old East Slavic (OES) (85.7% UAS and 80.16% LAS)."

Researchers have tackled the problem with various methods, from exploiting conventional texture feature extraction such as LBP, BSIF, and LPQ to using deep neural networks with different architectures. Despite the results each of these techniques has achieved for a certain attack scenario or dataset, most of them still failed to generalized the problem for unseen conditions, as the efficiency of each is limited to certain type of presentation attacks and instruments (PAI). In this paper, instead of completely extracting hand-crafted texture features or relying only on deep neural networks, we address the problem via fusing both wide and deep features in a unified neural architecture. The main idea is to take advantage of the strength of both methods to derive well-generalized solution for the problem.

However, as NBIoT systems were initially conceived for TNs, their basic design principles and operation might require some key modiﬁcations when incorporating the satellite component. These changes in NB-IoT systems, therefore, need to be carefully implemented in order to guarantee a seamless integration of both TN and non-terrestrial network (NTN) for a global coverage. This paper addresses this adaptation for the random access (RA) step in NBIoT systems, which is in fact the most challenging aspect in the NTN context, for it deals with multi-user time-frequency synchronization and timing advance for data scheduling. In particular, we propose an RA technique which is robust to typical satellite channel impairments, including long delays, signiﬁcant Doppler effects, and wide beams, without requiring any modiﬁcation to the current NB-IoT RA waveform.

The network employs a bipartite structure that enables longrange interactions across the image, while maintaining computation of linear efﬁciency, that can readily scale to high-resolution synthesis. It iteratively propagates information from a set of latent variables to the evolving visual features and vice versa, to support the reﬁnement of each in light of the other, and encourage the emergence of compositional representations for objects and scenes. In contrast to the classic transformer architecture, it utilizes multiplicative integration that allows ﬂexible region-based modulation, and can thus be seen as a multi-latent generalization of the successful StyleGAN network. We demonstrate the model’s strength and robustness through a careful evaluation over a range of datasets, from simulated multi-object environments to rich real-world indoor and outdoor scenes, showing it attains stateof-the-art results in terms of image quality and diversity, while enjoying fast learning and better data-efﬁciency.

By learning at the local scale (a voxel in our case) instead of the whole scene, LIDF can generalize to unseen objects because different objects may share similar local structures. 3) Voxel grids provide a natural partition of the 3D space. By deﬁning implicit function on ray-voxel pairs, we can signiﬁcantly reduce the inference time as the model only needs to consider occupied voxels intersected by the camera ray. Based on these motivations, we present a model to estimate the depth of a pixel by learning the relationship between the camera ray and its intersecting voxels given the color and local depth information. To further utilize the geometry of transparent object itself, we propose a depth reﬁnement model to update the prediction iteratively by combining the input RGB, input depth points and the predicted depth from LIDF. To train the whole pipeline, we create a large scale synthetic dataset, Omiverse Object dataset, using the NVIDIA Omniverse platform [2]. Our dataset provides over 60,000 images including both transparent and opaque objects in different scenes. The dataset is generated with diverse object models and poses, lighting conditions, camera viewpoints and background textures to close the sim-to-real gap.

This latent representation is in the form of 3D keypoints that are learned in an unsupervised way. The difference between the 3D keypoints of the source and the target objects then informs the shape deformation algorithm that deforms the source object into the target object. The whole model is learned end-to-end and simultaneously discovers 3D keypoints while learning to use them for deforming object shapes. Our approach produces intuitive and semantically consistent control of shape deformations. Moreover, our discovered 3D keypoints are consistent across object category instances despite large shape variations.

Recently, the issue of bias and discrimination in ML-based decision-making systems is receiving a lot of attention [29] as there are many recorded incidents of discrimination (e.g., recidivism prediction [21], grades prediction [4, 15]) caused by such systems against individuals or groups or people on the basis of protected attributes like gender, race etc. Bias in education is not a new problem, rather there is already a long literature on diﬀerent sources of bias in education [25] or students’ data analysis [3] as well as studies on racial bias [32] and gender bias [23].

Hence, if we could divide the original data set into subsets such that each of them satisﬁes the balance threshold t then grouping these subsets to generate the ﬁnal clustering would still preserve the fairness constraint. Each fair subset is deﬁned as a fairlet. We follow the deﬁnition of fairlet decomposition by [6]."
2104.12116,"dataset, data",239,2022-07-08,0,"ABSTRACT Traditionally, clustering algorithms focus on partitioning the data into groups of similar instances. The similarity objective, however, is not suﬃcient in applications where a fairrepresentation of the groups in terms of protected attributes like gender or race, is required for each cluster. Moreover, in many applications, to make the clusters useful for the end-user, a balanced cardinality among the clusters is required. Our motivation comes from the education domain where studies indicate that students might learn better in diverse student groups and of course groups of similar cardinality are more practical e.g., for group assignments. To this end, we introduce the fair-capacitated clustering problem that partitions the data into clusters of similar instances while ensuring cluster fairness and balancing cluster cardinalities. We propose a two-step solution to the problem: i) we rely on fairlets to generate minimal sets that satisfy the fair constraint and ii) we propose two approaches, namely hierarchical clustering and partitioning-based clustering, to obtain the fair-capacitated clustering. The hierarchical approach embeds the additional cardinality requirements during the merging step while the partitioning-based one alters the assignment step using a knapsack problem formulation to satisfy the additional requirements. Our experiments on four educational datasets show that our approaches deliver well-balanced clusters in terms of both fairness and cardinality while maintaining a good clustering quality."

We apply batch normalization [30] and we use rectiﬁed linear unit (ReLU) nonlinearities for each layer. We denote wl+1 the weights between node i of layer l and node j of layer l + 1. Weights are initialized from a normal distribution wl+1 ∼ N (0, 2/(nl + nl+1)) [31]. Each node also has a bias bl i, initialized at 0. The size of the output layer equals the number of categories (n4 = 1000 in this ﬁrst experiment, 10 in Section 6), which are converted to probabilities to compute the cross-entropy loss. The reported accuracy is the ratio of correct, most probable, labels. We train on mini-batches of 1000 images, and minimize through stochastic gradient descent with learning rate α = 0.1.

2105.00477,dataset,264,2022-07-08,0,"Traditional approaches for event extraction involve extracting event triggers at a sentence level. We adopt a no-trigger approach to label the documents with their corresponding events but instead of adopting a distant supervision method like (Zheng et al., 2019), we adopt a supervised approach with the aid of pre-trained language models in this task. Our dataset comprises of news articles, and most often, it has been observed that the central theme of such documents are divulged in the title of the document itself. Moreover, we ﬁnd that only 6% of the total corpus contains documents with multievent instances. Hence, we formulate this task as a multi-class sentence classiﬁcation task where each document corresponds to one event category. We consider the event labels of the ﬁrst event trigger instance in each document as the document’s manually assigned event label. We ﬁne-tune a pretrained multilingual BERT (mBERT) encoder with a linear classiﬁcation head on top to classify each document title instance to an event category. Since the titles of the documents are not explicitly deﬁned, we take the ﬁrst two sentences as the title of the news article and use it as our training and testing instances. We use the the pooled output of the encoder as input to the linear classiﬁcation head in the model. We ﬁnd this approach to be highly effective with a very high percentage of documents being assigned their correct event labels as shown in Table 2."
2105.00477,dataset,297,2022-07-08,0,"Event Argument extraction refers to the task of extracting structured information from unstructured text for a particular event of interest. The existing works exhibit poor capabilities to extract causal event arguments like Reason and After Effects. Furthermore, most of the existing works model this task at a sentence level, restricting the context to a local scope. While it may be effective for short spans of text, for longer bodies of text such as news articles, it has often been observed that the arguments for an event do not necessarily occur in the same sentence as that containing an event trigger. To tackle the issue of argument scattering across sentences, the use of global context becomes imperative in this task. In our work, we propose an external knowledge aided approach to infuse document level event information to aid the extraction of complex event arguments. We develop a causal network for our event-annotated dataset by extracting relevant event causal structures from ConceptNet and phrases from Wikipedia. We use the extracted event causal features in a bi-directional transformer encoder to effectively capture long-range inter-sentence dependencies.

2105.05385,dataset,282,2022-07-08,1,"Abstract A commonly-cited reason for the poor performance of automatic chord estimation (ACE) systems within music information retrieval (MIR) is that non-chord tones (i.e., notes outside the supporting harmony) contribute to error during the labeling process (e.g., Chen & Su, 2018; Masada & Bunescu, 2017). Despite the prevalence of machine-learning approaches in MIR, there are cases where alternative approaches provide a simpler alternative while allowing for insights into musicological practices.  In this project, we present a statistical model for predicting chord tones based on music theory rules. Our model is currently focused on predicting chord tones in classical music, since composition in this style is highly constrained, theoretically making the placement of chord tones highly predictable. Indeed, music theorists have labeling systems for every variety of non-chord tone, primarily classified by the note’s metric position and intervals of approach and departure. Using metric position, duration, and melodic intervals as predictors, we build a statistical model for predicting chord tones using the TAVERN dataset (Devaney et al. 2015). While our probabilistic approach is similar to other efforts in the domain of automatic harmonic analysis (e.g., Temperley 1997; Temperley & Sleator 1999), our focus is on melodic reduction rather than predicting harmony. However, we hope to pursue applications for ACE in the future. Finally, we implement our melody-reduction model using an existing symbolic visualization tool, to assist with melody reduction and non-chord for computational tone musicology researchers and music theorists."

The purpose of this paper is to improve the efficiency of the ensemble method in the sampling of training data sets, especially in the minority class, and to determine better basic classifiers for combining classifiers than existing methods.

Thus, the private information will be leaked if we directly access data in SD to train a target-domain classiﬁer (required by FDA methods). In this paper, to thoroughly prevent the privacy leakage in SD, we consider a very challenging problem setting, where the classiﬁer for the TD has to be trained using few labeled target data and a well-trained SD classiﬁer, named few-shot hypothesis adaptation (FHA). In FHA, we cannot access data in SD, as a result, the private information in SD will be protected well.

In the GIA scenario, the adversary is not able to modify the existing link structure or node attributes of the input graph, instead the attack is performed by injecting adversarial nodes into it. We present an analysis on the topological vulnerability of GNNs under GIA setting, based on which we propose the Topological Defective Graph Injection Attack (TDGIA) for effective injection attacks. TDGIA first introduces the topological defective edge selection strategy to choose the original nodes for connecting with the injected ones. It then designs the smooth feature optimization objective to generate the features for the injected nodes. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets show that TDGIA can consistently and significantly outperform various attack baselines in attacking dozens of defense GNN models.

Recently, one-stage approaches have become a new trend for this task due to their high efﬁciency. However, these approaches focus on detecting possible interaction points or ﬁltering human-object pairs, ignoring the variability in the location and size of different objects at spatial scales. To address this problem, we propose a transformer-based method, QAHOI (Query-Based Anchors for Human-Object Interaction detection), which leverages a multi-scale architecture to extract features from different spatial scales and uses query-based anchors to predict all the elements of an HOI instance. We further investigate that a powerful backbone signiﬁcantly increases accuracy for QAHOI, and QAHOI with a transformer-based backbone outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods by large margins on the HICO-DET benchmark.

2201.09913,"case study data, dataset, benchmark",196,2022-07-08,0,"Abstract—In acoustic signal processing, the target signals usually carry semantic information, which is encoded in a hierarchal structure of short and long-term contexts. However, the background noise distorts these structures in a nonuniform way. The existing deep acoustic signal enhancement (ASE) architectures ignore this kind of local and global effect. To address this problem, we propose to integrate a novel temporal attentive-pooling (TAP) mechanism into a conventional convolutional recurrent neural network, termed as TAP-CRNN. The proposed approach considers both global and local attention for ASE tasks. Specifically, we first utilize a convolutional layer to extract local information of the acoustic signals and then a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture is used to characterize temporal contextual information. Second, we exploit a novel attention mechanism to contextually process salient regions of the noisy signals. The proposed ASE system is evaluated using a benchmark infant cry dataset and compared with several well-known methods. It is shown that the TAPCRNN can more effectively reduce noise components from infant cry signals in unseen background noises at challenging signal-to-noise levels."

In that case, we do not need to train a problem-speciﬁc neural synthesizer. Hence, in this article, we discuss important aspects of neural generation of TF representations particularly for sound synthesis. We focus on the short-time Fourier transform (STFT, e.g., Allen, 1977; Wexler & Raz, 1990), the best understood and widely used TF representation in the ﬁeld of audio processing. First, we revisit some properties of the continuous STFT (Portnoff, 1976; Auger et al., 2012; Gr¨ochenig, 2001) and the progress in phaseless reconstruction of audio signals from STFT coefﬁcients (Pr˚uˇsa et al., 2017). Then, we discuss these properties in the context of the discrete STFT in order to compile guidelines for the choice of STFT parameters ensuring the reliability of sound synthesis and to provide tools monitoring the training progress of the generative models. For the latter, we introduce a novel, experimental measure for the consistency of the STFT. Eventually, we demonstrate the applicability of our guidelines by introducing TiFGAN, a network which generates audio using a TF representation. We provide perceptual and numerical evaluations of TiFGAN demonstrating improved audio quality compared to a state-of-the-art GAN for audio synthesis1.

This has made the storage and retrieval of large volumes of health-care data, especially, highresolution medical images, particularly challenging. Effective image compression for medical images thus plays a vital role in todays healthcare information system, particularly in teleradiology. In this work, an X-ray image compression method based on a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN-Conv) is presented. The proposed architecture can provide variable compression rates during deployment while it requires each network to be trained only once for a speciﬁc dimension of X-ray images. The model uses a multi-level pooling scheme that learns contextualized features for effective compression. We perform our image compression experiments on the National Institute of Health (NIH) ChestX-ray8 dataset and compare the performance of the proposed architecture with a state-of-theart RNN based technique and JPEG 2000. The experimental results depict improved compression performance achieved by the proposed method in terms of Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) metrics.

2003.00063,"publicly available, dataset",224,2022-07-08,1,"Abstract: Human beings have developed fantastic abilities to integrate information from various sensory sources exploring their inherent complementarity. Perceptual capabilities are therefore heightened, enabling, for instance, the well-known ""cocktail party"" and McGurk effects, i.e., speech disambiguation from a panoply of sound signals. This fusion ability is also key in reﬁning the perception of sound source location, as in distinguishing whose voice is being heard in a group conversation. Furthermore, neuroscience has successfully identiﬁed the superior colliculus region in the brain as the one responsible for this modality fusion, with a handful of biological models having been proposed to approach its underlying neurophysiological process. Deriving inspiration from one of these models, this paper presents a methodology for effectively fusing correlated auditory and visual information for active speaker detection. Such an ability can have a wide range of applications, from teleconferencing systems to social robotics. The detection approach initially routes auditory and visual information through two specialized neural network structures. The resulting embeddings are fused via a novel layer based on the superior colliculus, whose topological structure emulates spatial neuron cross-mapping of unimodal perceptual ﬁelds. The validation process employed two publicly available datasets, with achieved results conﬁrming and greatly surpassing initial expectations."

It is important to note that we do not claim that clustering contextualized representations is the optimal approach for POSI as representations with short context (Lin et al. 2015), (He, Neubig, and Berg-Kirkpatrick 2018) and word-based POSI (Yatbaz, Sert, and Yuret 2012) have shown best results. Our approach explores the potential of contextualized representations for unsupervised induction of syntax and acts as an unsupervised probe for interpreting these representations. Nevertheless, we report competitive many-to-one (M1) accuracies for POSI on the 45-tag Penn Treebank WSJ dataset as compared to specialized state-of-the-art approaches in the literature (He, Neubig, and Berg-Kirkpatrick 2018) and improve upon the state of the art on the 12 tag universal treebank dataset across multiple languages (Stratos, Collins, and Hsu 2016; Stratos 2019).

We observe impressive crosslingual POSI performance, showcasing the representational power of mBERT, especially when the languages are related.

The model allows eﬃcient inference over the constraints for future actions in the context of a rich space of perceptual concepts such as object class, shape, color, relative position, mutual actions, etc. as well as factual concepts (does an object belong to an agent such as a human) that grow over time. Crucially, the approach attempts to balance the computational cost of incremental inference versus the space complexity of knowledge persistence. Our model maintains a learned representation as a belief over factual relations from past language. The model accrues visual observations but delays estimation of grounding of perceptual concepts. Online, the model estimates the necessary past visual context required for interpreting the instruction. The context guides the construction of a constrained grounding model that performs focused time-series inference over past visual observations. This approach incurs an additional inference cost online but reduces the need for exhaustively estimating all perceptual groundings from past observations. Factors in the model are trained in a data-driven manner using an aligned vision-language corpus. We demonstrate the approach on a Baxter Research Robot following and executing complex natural language instructions in a manipulation domain using a standardized object data set."

1902.08029,package,344,2022-07-08,0,"For each network, we consider three partitions: (I) The partition obtained on the mesh itself (Algorithm 1); we refer to these partitions as P(G), (II) the partition induced from the partition on the graph representation of the DFN P(F) (Algorithm 2), and (III) the reﬁned partition (Algorithm 3) P(F/G). In our experimental results, we use the graph partitioning package KaHIP (Sanders and Schulz, 2013) which among other methods implements the Global Path algorithm for matching, and ﬂow-based methods for partition reﬁnement. The quality of the partitions is judged by the cut (number of edges that link between partitions) and the imbalance (the difference in sizes of the partitions). Our choice in using KaHIP as baseline graph partitioning solver stems from the fact that KaHIP has been experimentally shown to produce high-quality partitions for graphs that exhibit a power-law degree distribution, which is a property of the DFN graphs in this work (Hyman et al., 2019b,a). For the DFN partitioning, we use the kaffpaE solver with the strong social pre-conﬁguration and use the fast pre-conﬁguration for the mesh partitioning. We choose the kaffpaE solver together with the strong-social pre-conﬁguration mainly due to the fact the DFN graphs have a power-law degree distribution, similar to a social network that these methods are designed for. We also compare the impact of the partitions on computational performance by solving porous media ﬂow equations, which are Laplace’s equation under steady-state conditions, and solve for the distribution of pressure within the network. Here, we compare the number of FLOPS, the wallclock run time, and number of iterations to obtain the solution using a bi-conjugate gradient scheme with a block Jacobi preconditioner using the PETSC (Balay et al., 2017) toolkit."

Especially, deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based algorithms have been widely applied in image classification [27], segmentation [28], and denoising [29, 30]. Recently, based on residual learning and batch normalization in Res U-Net, the content aware image restoration (CARE) method demonstrated good performance in denoising and resolution improvement of low photon-budget microscopy images [30]. Besides, in acoustics area, researchers proposed CNNbased methods and denoising autoencoder (DAE) architectures for noise reduction [31, 32]. The DAE method successfully filtered out background noise and improve the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ). Inspired by the success of CNN and DAE methods, in this work, we proposed a Fully Convolutional Deep Denoising Autoencoder (DDAE) method to reduce the noise in low photon-budget multiphoton microscopic images, especially for three-photon fluorescence and third-harmonic generation images. Without residual learning or batch normalization structures, the DDAE model has less limitation on its hardware implementation in the future. After training with 28 sets of microscopy data, we found the compact DDAE model already outperforms Gaussian filter, median filter, and benchmark BM3D algorithm on signal-to-noise ratio and structure similarity. Moreover, DDAE well preserves stochastic resonance enhanced features so that regions of nuclei or cells can be delineated more correctly, which is important for further segmentation works."

We will also try to train the neural network with cleaner images excited by higher laser power and detected at lower gain. A good denoising method can speed up the applications, such as high-throughput image segmentation, fast 3D morphodynamic analysis, and long-term cell tracking. We expect this denoising method can be organically integrated into those process of imaging analysis, help improve the processing efficiency of many highthroughput microscopies, and finally achieve on-line denoising on the hardware."

After learning the node embeddings based on the training graph, we predict the missing links by generating a ranked list of potential links.

1912.08808,data,257,2022-07-08,0,"Abstract—Graph embedding has become a key component of many data mining and analysis systems. Current graph embedding approaches either sample a large number of node pairs from a graph to learn node embeddings via stochastic optimization or factorize a high-order node proximity/adjacency matrix via computationally intensive matrix factorization techniques. These approaches typically require signiﬁcant resources for the learning process and rely on multiple parameters, which limits their applicability in practice. Moreover, most of the existing graph embedding techniques operate effectively in one speciﬁc metric space only (e.g., the one produced with cosine similarity), do not preserve higher-order structural features of the input graph and cannot automatically determine a meaningful number of dimensions for the embedding space. Typically, the produced embeddings are not easily interpretable, which complicates further analyses and limits their applicability. To address these issues, we propose DAOR, a highly efﬁcient and parameter-free graph embedding technique producing metric space-robust, compact and interpretable embeddings without any manual tuning. Compared to a dozen state-of-the-art graph embedding algorithms, DAOR yields competitive results on both node classiﬁcation (which beneﬁts form high-order proximity) and link prediction (which relies on low-order proximity mostly). Unlike existing techniques, however, DAOR does not require any parameter tuning and improves the embeddings generation speed by several orders of magnitude. Our approach has hence the ambition to greatly simplify and speed up data analysis tasks involving graph representation learning."

By treating pairs of task-speciﬁc data sets and target models as (feature, label) samples, we can reduce many meta-learning algorithms to instances of supervised learning. This view not only uniﬁes meta-learning into an intuitive and practical framework but also allows us to transfer insights from supervised learning directly to improve meta-learning. For example, we obtain a better understanding of generalization properties, and we can readily transfer well-understood techniques, such as model ensemble, pre-training, joint training, data augmentation, and even nearest neighbor based methods.

Such a corpus should therefore be perfect for learning ASD as it covers all previously mentioned requirements for a suitable audiovisual dataset and presents no major drawbacks. To support this, the team behind AVA-ActiveSpeaker used it to train and test both static and recurrent prediction models, applying modality fusion and consistently achieving great performances. Unfortunately however, this dataset encompasses an extremely high amount of low quality videos in terms of image resolution, audio intelligibility and noise. The creators of the dataset even went so far as to include several voice-over videos and dubbed versions of movies not in their original language. This naturally means a copious amount of audio clips are out of sync with their supposedly respective facial image sequences. Additionally, the lengths of these clips frequently do not pair with the lengths of those facial sequences—due to phrases varying in duration for different languages. Taking this into account each of the 160 videos was manually inspected for quality assessment, as though they may be appropriate for a challenge in the same conditions, it would be senseless to use such great amounts of noisy incorrect data to train a model and expect it to perform successfully with correct data and in the real world.

2011.00485,"dataset, data",194,2022-07-08,0,"The classiﬁcation of DNA sequences is a key research area in bioinformatics as it enables researchers to conduct genomic analysis and detect possible diseases. In this paper, three state-of-the-art algorithms, namely Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Neural Networks, and N-gram Probabilistic Models, are used for the task of DNA classiﬁcation. Furthermore, we introduce a novel feature extraction method based on the Levenshtein distance and randomly generated DNA sub-sequences to compute information-rich features from the DNA sequences. We also use an existing feature extraction method based on 3-grams to represent amino acids and combine both feature extraction methods with a multitude of machine learning algorithms. Four diﬀerent data sets, each concerning viral diseases such as Covid-19, AIDS, Inﬂuenza, and Hepatitis C, are used for evaluating the diﬀerent approaches. The results of the experiments show that all methods obtain high accuracies on the diﬀerent DNA datasets. Furthermore, the domain-speciﬁc 3-gram feature extraction method leads in general to the best results in the experiments, while the newly proposed technique outperforms all other methods on the smallest Covid-19 dataset."

Inﬂuenza viruses and coronaviruses may cause similar symptoms to patients. However, diﬀerent measures might need to be taken in order to support patients in their recoveries, depending on the type of virus they are infected with. Therefore it is crucial to know which kind of infection a patient has before a decision about the treatment is made.

2011.05428,data,206,2022-07-08,0,"Medical imaging data suffers from the limited availability of annotation because annotating 3D medical data is a time-consuming and expensive task. Moreover, even if the annotation is available, supervised learning-based approaches suffer highly imbalanced data. Most of the scans during the screening are from normal subjects, but there are also large variations in abnormal cases. To address these issues, recently, unsupervised deep anomaly detection methods that train the model on large-sized normal scans and detect abnormal scans by calculating reconstruction error have been reported. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning technique for anomaly detection. Our architecture largely consists of two parts: 1) Reconstruction and 2) predicting geometric transformations. By training the network to predict geometric transformations, the model could learn better image features and distribution of normal scans. In the test time, the geometric transformation predictor can assign the anomaly score by calculating the error between geometric transformation and prediction. Moreover, we further use self-supervised learning with context restoration for pretraining our model. By comparative experiments on clinical brain CT scans, the effectiveness of the proposed method has been veriﬁed."

First, we ﬁne-tune T5 and dBART models on O4B and test on the S2ORCB dataset, a large collection of over 119k summary/article pairs. S2ORCB is described in detail in Appendix A.3. Here, we consider 1024 source text tokens since that resulted in better benchmark scores. Given the datasets, a sizeable difference is observed in the training times as well. Results in Table 3a show that the models ﬁne-tuned on O4B (T5-O4B and dBART-O4B) achieve comparable performance to corresponding models ﬁne-tuned on the S2ORCB dataset. Second, we reverse the setup and ﬁne-tune models on the training portions of S2ORCB and then test on O4B. Table 3b indicates a similar gap in performance between the transfer models versus the ones trained on the target dataset (O4B in this case). The gaps hint at the challenges in the summarization task on the O4B dataset that cannot be solved by simply training on a larger dataset. In spite of the huge disparity in dataset sizes, similar model performances indicate that O4B can be effectively utilized for summarization systems."

2011.14271,data,251,2022-07-08,0,"load uncertainty can be fully captured by micro-PMUs, which can record highresolution data; however, in practice, micro-PMUs are installed at limited locations in distribution networks due to budgetary constraints. In contrast, smart meters are widely deployed but can only measure relatively low-resolution energy consumption, which cannot sufﬁciently reﬂect the actual instantaneous load volatility within each sampling interval. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach for enriching load data for service transformers that only have low-resolution smart meters. The key to our approach is to statistically recover the high-resolution load data, which is masked by the low-resolution data, using trained probabilistic models of service transformers that have both highand low-resolution data sources, i.e, micro-PMUs and smart meters. The overall framework consists of two steps: ﬁrst, for the transformers with micro-PMUs, a Gaussian Process is leveraged to capture the relationship between the maximum/minimum load and average load within each low-resolution sampling interval of smart meters; a Markov chain model is employed to characterize the transition probability of known high-resolution load. Next, the trained models are used as teachers for the transformers with only smart meters to decompose known low-resolution load data into targeted high-resolution load data. The enriched data can recover instantaneous load uncertainty and signiﬁcantly enhance distribution system observability and situational awareness. We have veriﬁed the proposed approach using real high- and lowresolution load data."

For example, it can reﬂect the kind of activities people do there, or the type of crowds that frequently visit the region (e.g., tourist hot spot, student neighborhood, business center). We propose a method to automatically create underground neighborhood maps of cities by analyzing how people dress. Using publicly available images from across a city, our method ﬁnds neighborhoods with a similar fashion sense and segments the map without supervision. For 37 cities worldwide, we show promising results in creating good underground maps, as evaluated using experiments with human judges and underground map benchmarks derived from non-image data. Our approach further allows detecting distinct neighborhoods (what is the most unique region of LA?) and answering analogy questions between cities (what is the “Downtown LA” of Bogota?).
