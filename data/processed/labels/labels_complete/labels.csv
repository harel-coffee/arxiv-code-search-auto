For these experiments, the proposed compression method was deployed on each dimension and the performance metrics are averaged over all the dimensions. In this regard, Dataset 2 ( comprising of three medical images and the color version of lena.jpg image) was used to benchmark ZT-based algorithm with those of DCT and FWHT. It can be observed in Figs. 11a and 12a that ZT-based transform have competitive performance on Scan1 data for block sizes 4 128, performance of ZT-based 8, 32 algorithm plummeted in comparison with DCT and FWHT-based approaches. Experimentation with Scan2 image shows that ZT consistently compresses the MRI data better and faster than its counterpart for most of the block sizes considered as shown in Figs. 11b and 12b. With block size of 128 128, the performance of FWHT improves and became comparable with ZT. Better performance in compression and speed of implementation is again observed on the average for ZT-based method using the Scan3 image, and the performance is more pronounced when the block size is 128 128 as shown in Figs. 11c and 12c. Again the proposed algorithm using color version of Lena image was compared with those of DCT and FWHT. It was observed that for most of the block sizes, ZT consistently compresses better and faster than its counterparts as shown in Figs. 11d and 12d.

IV v2 (developed by Jacob Hoyos, Matthew Dale, and Noah Carter) goes a step further by not only displaying the GUI but also acting as a server and relaying the SPaT data to a single speciﬁed client machine over a local network. In IV v2, said client then displays the GUI based on the received SPaT data. The intended use of these applications was to serve as a learning experience and a prototype for the application described in section 3 of this report, IV v3.

There have been quite a few researches attempting to generate data processing results by directly linking records in the tables to the semantic meaning of the natural language input, such as [6] and [7]. However, these attempts are not scalable to big tables and are not reusable when the database schema is changed. More recent approaches use only the natural language input and the database schema and metadata to generate the queries. We review the most recent approaches in our research. Furthermore, the release of large annotated datasets containing questions and the corresponding database queries has additionally enhanced the ability to use deep learning or supervised techniques to tackle this problem. This has enabled the problem to evolve into a more complex task where the approaches should be domain independent and involving multiple tables with complex queries."

Each tool was employed in two ways: (i) the turn method, which annotates a single turn, irrespective of the conversation history, and (ii) the history method, which annotates each turn given the conversation history up to that turn. For the CAsT dataset, only user utterances were given to the EL tool, while for other datasets both system and user utterances were considered as conversation history. This is due to relatively long system utterances in the CAsT dataset, which makes infeasible for the EL tools to annotate the whole conversation history.

Figure 6 displays an example from the test set, which shows the gold standard images and the DL reconstructions for data undersampled with R = 4. Generally the visual quality of all the images (both gold standard and reconstructed ones) reduces with increased JPEG compression level (left-to-right in Figure 6); this is expected from compressed data. However, the NRMSE metric shows an unexpected effect: it improves with the compression, i.e. the reconstruction error reduces although the image visual quality degrades. The reason for this phenomenon is that in retrospective experiments the reconstruction quality is measured w.r.t. to a ""gold standard"" image that is also processed (see the pipeline in Figure 1c); the error metric is therefore blind to data processing. Strikingly, the NRMSE could show a misleading improvement even when the human eye cannot see any difference, as demonstrated in the left two columns of Figure 6: although the reconstructions from NC and QF = 75 are visually similar, the NRMSE of the latter is lower by 30%.

1807.04488,code,185,2022-04-21,0,"Abstract—During software maintenance, developers usually deal with a signiﬁcant number of software change requests. As a part of this, they often formulate an initial query from the request texts, and then attempt to map the concepts discussed in the request to relevant source code locations in the software system (a.k.a., concept location). Unfortunately, studies suggest that they often perform poorly in choosing the right search terms for a change task. In this paper, we propose a novel technique –ACER– that takes an initial query, identiﬁes appropriate search terms from the source code using a novel term weight –CodeRank, and then suggests effective reformulation to the initial query by exploiting the source document structures, query quality analysis and machine learning. Experiments with 1,675 baseline queries from eight subject systems report that our technique can improve 71% of the baseline queries which is highly promising. Comparison with ﬁve closely related existing techniques in query reformulation not only validates our empirical ﬁndings but also demonstrates the superiority of our technique."

They improve about 55% and about 53% of the baseline queries respectively. Such ratios are also pretty close to the originally reported performances by Haiduc et al. on a different dataset, which possibly validates the correctness of our implementation. While 55% query improvement is the maximum performance provided by any of the existing approaches, our technique–ACER–improves about 70% of the baseline queries (i.e., 1% difference between Table V and Table IX due to rounding error) which is signiﬁcantly higher, i.e., paired t-test, p-value=6.663e-06<0.05, Cohen’s D=2.43>1.00 (large). Refoqus adopts a similar methodology like ours. Unfortunately, the approach is limited due to possibly the low performance of its candidate reformulations. One might argue about the data resampling step (i.e., Step 9, Fig. 2) of ACER for the high performance. However, we also apply data resampling to Refoqus using the same settings as ours for further investigation. We see that Refoqussampled has a similar improvement ratio like ours, but it still worsens a signiﬁcant amount of queries, 29%, compared to our 3.40%. Thus, our technique still performs better than Refoqus in the equal settings. Our quantile measures and mean ranks are more promising than those from the baseline or competing methods as reported in Table IX.

Privacy-Preservation in Centralised Federated Learning Framework As an ML model can be cooperatively trained while retaining training data and computation on-device, FL naturally oﬀers privacy-guarantee advantages compared to the traditional ML approaches. Unfortunately, although personal data is not directly sent to a coordination server in its original form, the local ML model parameters still contain sensitive information because some features of the training data samples are inherently encoded into such models [5, 81, 4, 96, 86]. For example, authors in [5] have shown that during the training process, correlations implied in the training data are concealed inside the trained models, and personal information can be subsequently extracted. Melis et al. have also pointed out that modern deep-learning models conceal internal representations of all kinds of features, and some of them are not related to the task being learned. Such unintended features can be exploited to infer some information about the training data samples. FL systems, consequently,"

Training over non-IID data has been shown to be much less accurate as well as slower convergence than IID data in federated settings [128]. Konečn`y with his colleagues at Google went further on improving the eﬃciency of the FSVRG algorithms in distributed settings by minimising the information in parameter update to be sent to an orchestration server [71]. Two types of updates are considered called structured updates and sketched updates in which the number of variables used in an ML model is minimised as many as possible, along with the compression of the information in the full model updates. Another ambitious federated optimisation approach is that local nodes are independently trained diﬀerent ML models as a task in a multi-learning objective simultaneously [113]. Generally, local nodes generate data under diﬀerent distributions which naturally ﬁt separate learning models; however, these models are structurally similar resulting in the ability to model the similarity using a multi-tasking learning (MTL) framework. Therefore, this approach improves performance when dealing with non-IID data as well as guarantees the learning convergence [113]."

Unfortunately, due to the black-box operation model and the limitation of the transparency in ML, including FL, training process, results (e.g., a global ML model in FL) are generally generated without any proper explanation [119]. Thus, it is infeasible to predict whether outcomes of an ML model might aﬀect the legal status or legal rights of the Data Subject, or negatively impact on its circumstances, behaviour or choices. Consequently, any FL system fails to comply with the GDPR requirements of the data subject’s right in control of automated decision making. Fortunately, this requirement can be neglected if a Data Controller explicitly mentions the lack of automated decision making and proﬁling right when asking for Data Subject’s consent to process personal data."

Although a number of methods are proposed based on this assumption [7, 9, 36], it can be too restrictive, since it is often diﬃcult to determine how the confounder aﬀects treatment assignments and outcomes. A less restrictive assumption is that we have access to proxy variables, which contain relevant side information on the confounder. In the ﬂight tickets example, we can use the number of views of the ticket reservation page as a proxy variable, which reﬂects peoples’ desire for ﬂights. Note that if we can completely recover the confounder from proxy variables, the ignorable treatment assignment assumption can be satisﬁed. Motivated by this, Lee et al. [14] and Louizos et al. [17] aim to recover the distribution of confounders from proxy variables using modern machine learning techniques such as generative adversarial networks [5] or variational auto-encoders (VAE) [11].
