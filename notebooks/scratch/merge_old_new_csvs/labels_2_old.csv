Figure 6 displays an example from the test set, which shows the gold standard images and the DL reconstructions for data undersampled with R = 4. Generally the visual quality of all the images (both gold standard and reconstructed ones) reduces with increased JPEG compression level (left-to-right in Figure 6); this is expected from compressed data. However, the NRMSE metric shows an unexpected effect: it improves with the compression, i.e. the reconstruction error reduces although the image visual quality degrades. The reason for this phenomenon is that in retrospective experiments the reconstruction quality is measured w.r.t. to a ""gold standard"" image that is also processed (see the pipeline in Figure 1c); the error metric is therefore blind to data processing. Strikingly, the NRMSE could show a misleading improvement even when the human eye cannot see any difference, as demonstrated in the left two columns of Figure 6: although the reconstructions from NC and QF = 75 are visually similar, the NRMSE of the latter is lower by 30%.

In this regard, Dataset 2 ( comprising of three medical images and the color version of lena.jpg image) was used to benchmark ZT-based algorithm with those of DCT and FWHT. It can be observed in Figs. 11a and 12a that ZT-based transform have competitive performance on Scan1 data for block sizes 4 128, performance of ZT-based 8, 32 algorithm plummeted in comparison with DCT and FWHT-based approaches.

Also, the higher test accuracy is due to greater generalization owing to L2 regularizer used in our model.

2203.02776,data repos,04/21/22,0,"Now, the predicates and the operators use words that depend on the domain in which we want to teach people far-sightedness. Generally, the structure for the translation obtained with the extended version of AI-powered boosting is as follows: For the translation of predicates, if there is at least one non-negated predicate in a step (other than T RU E), the translation always begins with the template “ACT pred (OBJ, REW)”, where ACT is substituted with a domain-speciﬁc action word, and pred (OBJ, REW) is substituted with a domain-speciﬁc translation of predicate pred that contains OBJ as the object word represented by nodes in the Mouselab-MDP, and REW as the reward word represented by numbers hidden underneath the nodes. For instance, the action word could be “Look up”, the object word could be “hotels, the reward word could be “the prices” and the predicate could capture the property of being positioned in the last level from the start node of the Mouselab-MDP. The translation would then read “’look up the prices of the most distant hotels. If there are any negated predicates in a step, they are translated afterwards. The translations of those predicates themselves are listed in bulletpoints following the template “Do not ACT:”.Special predicates include the always T RU E predicate, which is translated to “Stop planning right away or ACT some random OBJ and then stop planning.” (because the available planning operations always include both clicking the nodes and terminating), and always F ALSE predicate, which is translated using the template “Do not ACT anything.” (because the always F ALSE predicate appears in the description only on its own – for the “no-action” strategy). For the translation of the temporal operators, when a step includes an UNTIL operator with condition cond( OBJ, REW), the translation template becomes “Repeat this step until cond( OBJ, REW)”. If there is an UNLESS operator with condition cond( OBJ, REW) in a step, the translation of the step starts with the text “Unless cond( OBJ, REW), in which case stop at the previous step, ”. If the there is a HOLD operator in a step, the translation of the step is added the following text “Repeat this step as long as possible.”. Finally, if there is a LOOP operator with expression EXPR in a step (which can only occur in the last step), the algorithm matches the number of the step in which expression EXPR appeared the latest, say NUM, and adds the template “GOTO step NUM ” to the translation. The exact translation for the predicates in our DSL and the rules governing how the steps are translated can be found in our project’s repository in the translation.py ﬁle."

The estimation error of the policy value comes from multiple sources including: (1) the approximation error due to lack of model capacity (2) generalization error due to the limited dataset size (3) the oﬀ-policyness, or the divergence between the oﬄine data distribution and the target policy distribution, which aﬀects the eﬀective size of the dataset (4) optimization error, aﬀected by the optimization algorithm, and (5) the bias of ignoring the stochasticity of the dynamics. As demonstrated in Section 5.1, the beneﬁts of IV methods depend on multiple conditions. Compared to the large near-policy dataset on BSuite, the pure oﬄine dataset, including the continuous control tasks has higher modeling challenges, less data, and a larger divergence between the behavior and target distributions.

First, unlike these works, we do not require a labeled dataset to train our system to synthesize adversarial samples at inference time. Second, the methods in [18] and [19] are only implemented for targeted and non-targeted attacks. Our approach, on the other hand, is unifying in that it offers full control over the desired output PMF of the trained classiﬁer (while maintaining similarity to speciﬁc input features), making it applicable to a wide range of scenarios, including targeted/non-targetted attacks, conﬁdence reduction attacks, and synthesis of decision boundary examples."

This is because the unsupervised training takes more time to converge, and it only needs benign data (which rarely reaches 100 000 samples anyway) in its train set. The procedure followed to reach at the same time these numbers of samples and the desired class proportions is to use upsampling (duplicating the original samples) when more samples than available are needed, and downsampling (keeping only a subset of the original samples) otherwise. Either way, it takes place after splitting the data between the train and test sets, so no data leak is created. After setting the proportions of each class and the desired number of samples per device, we obtain a dataset where the number of samples and the proportions of classes are the same for all devices. After this balancing process, the train set of client 𝑘 is and its threshold selection set (in the unsu. The number of training . |"

On more realistic examples from BSuite and DM Control, we have investigated scenarios where the evaluation policy is close to the behavioral one and where it is far from it. When doing OPE for a policy near to the one having generated data, we ﬁnd that the confounding eﬀect could be very pronounced and that techniques like DBRM are performing poorly. We also ﬁnd that the best IV method - AGMM - displays performance on par with FQE and is only outperformed by distributional FQE. However, when evaluating a policy far from the one(s) having generated the observations, the combination of distribution shift and model mismatch has a non-negligible impact on performance. While we observe that AGMM also performed on par with FQE and DFQE, DBRM surprisingly also performs very well, and in general appears more stable (suﬀers from fewer outliers with poor performance) than FQE and DFQE."

For this, we sample 100k observational samples per graph, and 10k samples per intervention. We observed that this is sufﬁcient to model most conditional probabilities up to a negligible error. The results are shown in Table 11. We ﬁnd that, in line with the theoretical guarantees, ENCO can reliably recover most graphs, only making 0.3 mistakes on average on the full graph. Of the baselines, only DCDI is able to recover the collider graph without errors since its edges can be independently orientated. For all other graphs, DCDI converges to acyclic graphs, but incorrectly orients some edges and predicts false positive edges, while being 8 times slower than ENCO on the same hardware. All other baselines show improved SHD scores than in Table 1 as well, but are not able to match ENCO’s performance. This shows that, even in the data limit, ENCO achieves notably better results than concurrent methods."

MultiChannel Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (MCLCNN) which uses squeeze convolution, the depth-wise convolution, and the point-wise convolution is proposed in [31] for MI classiﬁcation. Two end-to-end deep learning models based on CNN are proposed in [32]. These models are called two stage hierarchical model. Furthermore, generative adversarial networks (GANs) is used for data augmentation and to reduce the class imbalance. In [33], authors proposed a neural network model for precise classiﬁcation of heartbeats by following the AAMI inter-patient standards. This model works in two steps. In the ﬁrst step the signals are preprocessed and then features are extracted from the signals. In the second step, the classiﬁcation is performed by a two-layer classiﬁer in which each layer consists of two independent fully-connected neural networks. The experiments show that the proposed model precisely detects arrhythmia conditions. In [34], authors proposed a complex deep learning model consists of CNN and LSTM. This model classiﬁes six types of ECG signals by processing ten seconds ECG slices of MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset. Experimental results proved that the proposed model could be used by cardiologists to detect arrhythmia. In [35], authors presented CNN based model for proper diagnoses of congestive heart failure using ECG. The testing and training of the proposed model was carried out on publicly available ECG datasets. Performance of the proposed model shows the authenticity of model for congestive heart failure detection."

An algorithm like Dijkstra’s can answer such a query in near-linear time in the size of the graph. If we allow for precomputations, we can break this bound, for instance by simply storing the answers to all possible queries in a look-up table. However, a fast query time should preferably not come at the cost of a large space requirement. A distance oracle is a compact data structure that can answer a shortest path distance query in constant or close to constant time."

Figure 2b exempliﬁes the distribution of the target CT samples before adaptation. As we can see from Table 1, the source-trained model is able to achieve some level of class separation without any adaptation, which is conﬁrmed in Figure 2b. Even so, we observe non-trivial overlap between the latent embeddings of two of the classes. In Figure 2c we observe that this overlap is reduced after adaptation. We also observe that the latent embedding of the target CT samples is shifted towards the prototypical distribution. For completeness, we repeat the same analysis for the organ segmentation dataset. We observe a similar behavior in the shift of the target embeddings based on the learned prototypical distribution, however compared to the heart segmentation dataset this shift is visually less pronounced."

2201.00732,"data, dataset",,,"We have implemented a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) inspired by the computer vision community to analyze data of turbulent ﬂows under rotation with the goal to infer the rotation frequency of the reference frame from the resulting ﬂow velocity ﬁeld. To put our self in a realistic scenario we assumed to have just a limited knowledge of the ﬂow, and in particular we imagined to have access only to a bidimensional cut of the full 3d domain and to have the velocity only at a ﬁxed time during the evolution. As argued, these two assumptions make the problem diﬃcult enough that no other tools of analysis are known to be able to achieve such goal under the same conditions, and allowed us to show how Machine Learning can push forward our data analysis capability. Indeed, results showed that even a simple DCNN properly trained has been able to solve such problem with unprecedented accuracy. For comparison, the only other possible way to repeat the same inference without using temporal information, was to use a standard Bayesian inference based on diﬀerent observables. For us, the natural choice from the type of problem and the available data, was to measure moments of the velocity ﬁeld and of the velocity gradients. As discussed all results have highlighted the potential of DCNN, that were able to outperform any other inference attempt. As brieﬂy discussed in the introduction, an unsupervised classiﬁcation of the same dataset has been attempted using a GMM classiﬁcation algorithm, however no relation between the classes identiﬁed and the rotation value has been found. Indeed GMM, as more in general k-means algorithms [56], are mainly sensitive to the number of vortexes inside each plane and to their spatial location, hence, to observables that are not closely connected to the rotation value but can only be used to distinguish the dynamics above and below the transition threshold from direct to inverse cascade. For this reason a detailed analysis using this tool has been omitted in the paper. From this study we want to bring two main messages. The ﬁrst is, from a physics point of view, that Machine Learning provides tools that can be highly beneﬁcial in problems of data analysis of complex systems, the work presented in [24] is another example. Second, on the other hand, is to show how physical systems can be ideal testing grounds for new ML algorithms,"

That occurs because they measure the difference between two images (the gold standard and reconstructed image) that are based on the same processed data. Ideally, the error metrics should measure the difference between the reconstructed image and the original unprocessed one, but because the latter is unavailable (since it was not stored in the database), the metrics become blind to the data processing. As a result, they cannot reﬂect the true reconstruction quality, and they might produce misleading results."

In the ﬁrst difference, EX [ X2) is the X2)], we know that p(X3| X1, X2) + log p(X3| optimal estimator, since the ground truth data is generated via this conditional. Thus, independent of what function the network has learned for p(X3| X1, X2), the difference above can be only greater X1, X2), there are value combinations that have never been or equals to zero. Note that for p(X3| = X2, such that in practice we can’t guarantee a speciﬁc distribution to be learned observed, i.e. X1 (cid:54) for such conditionals. Still, this does not constitute a problem for ﬁnding the graph as shown above. The second difference, EX [ X1) + log p(X3)], can be similarly reasoned. Since X1 is X1) cannot lead to a better estimator than p(X3), independent of X3 under interventions on X2, p(X3| X1) was trained on observational even when trained on the interventional data. However, since p(X3| data, where there exist a strong correlation between X1 and X3, this estimator must be strictly worse than p(X3). Hence, this difference will be strictly positive. To summarize, under interventions on X2, the edge X1 → X3 will be trained towards decreasing its probability. Further, under interventions on X1, the effect of X1 on X3 can be fully expressed by X3 goes conditioning on X2, making this gradient going to zero when the edge probability X2 → towards one. For the edge X2 → X3 itself, the same reasoning as here can be followed such that X3 is included in the graph or not, conditioning X3 on X2 independent of whether the edge X1 → can only lead to an improvement in its estimator. Therefore, ENCO is able to ﬁnd the correct graph despite it not being faithful."

The development of 5G has led to large innovations in these respects. It becomes even more challenging when going to higher frequencies. The main reason for moving to higher frequency bands is to greatly expand the available spectrum. In the sub-THz to THz region, hardware constraints such as the speed of data converters and computational complexity will cause challenges to make eﬃcient use of wide bandwidths.

By forcing any coarse-graining mapping from Rp to Rq (q ≤ p) as an information conversion invertible process and an information dropping out process, the NIS framework can squeeze the information of micro-states to form macro-states and make prediction on future micro-states according to the macrostates. Finally, an eﬀective coarse-graining strategy and macro-state dynamics with emergent causality can be learned. This minimal framework can not only allow us to control information conversion and discarding in a precise way, but also enable us to mathematically analyze the whole framework in a tractable way. We prove a series of mathematical theorems to reveal the properties of the NIS, and we analytically derive an expression of eﬀective information for causal emergence without the explicit macro-dynamics. At last, we show how NIS can learn the eﬀective coarse-graining strategy and macro-state dynamics numerically on a set of examples."

2203.0248,data,,,"On one side, works that predict high-level behavioral representations such as social cues or signals often need to compare single or multiple discrete predictions to a single observed ground truth (one-to-one). For univariate classiﬁcation, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) is a common choice, as it very well describes the overall performance of the model. The classic accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are valid alternatives for both single and multi-class classiﬁcation. On the other side, low-level behavioral representations are often continuous and therefore conceived as regression tasks. For those, the L1 and L2 distances have traditionally been the golden standard. Variants of L2-based metrics have been used depending on the ﬁeld of application. For example, in human motion forecasting with joints, the Mean-Per-Joint-Position Error (MPJPE), the Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK), or the cosine similarity are very frequent options. In this context, Adeli et al. (2021) raised the common problem of missing data (e.g., occluded or out-of-view joints). To address this, they proposed metrics that evaluated the models performance under several visibility scenarios: the Visibility-Ignored Metric (VIM), the Visibility-Aware Metric (VAM) and the Visibility Score Metric (VSM). Diﬀerently, in behavior forecasting with raw image or audio, quality metrics like the Mean-Squared Error (MSE), the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) (Wang et al., 2004), or the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) are better suited. Indeed, this task shares many similarities with video prediction, so any metric from that ﬁeld can be leveraged for ours (Oprea et al., 2020)."

2203.0945,data,,,"2 Related Work Many approaches have been proposed to deal with CF in CL. Using regularization (Kirkpatrick et al. 2017) and knowledge distillation (Li and Hoiem 2016) to minimize the change to previous models are two popular approaches (Jung et al. 2016; Camoriano et al. 2017; Fernando et al. 2017; Rannen Ep Triki et al. 2017; Seff et al. 2017; Zenke, Poole, and Ganguli 2017; Kemker and Kanan 2018; Ritter, Botev, and Barber 2018; Schwarz et al. 2018; Xu and Zhu 2018; Castro et al. 2018; Dhar et al. 2019; Hu et al. 2019; Lee et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2020a). Memorizing some old examples and using them to adjust the old models in learning a new task is another popular approach (called replay) (Rusu et al. 2016; LopezPaz and Ranzato 2017; Rebufﬁ, Kolesnikov, and Lampert 2017; Chaudhry et al. 2019; de Masson d’Autume et al. 2019; Hou et al. 2019; Wu et al. 2019; Rolnick et al. 2019; Buzzega et al. 2020; Zhao et al. 2020; Rajasegaran et al. 2020a; Liu, Schiele, and Sun 2021). Several systems learn to generate pseudo training data of old tasks and use them to jointly train the new task, called pseudo-replay (Gepperth and Karaoguz 2016; Kamra, Gupta, and Liu 2017; Shin et al. 2017; Wu et al. 2018; Seff et al. 2017; Wu et al. 2018; Kemker and Kanan 2018; Hu et al. 2019; Hayes et al. 2019; Rostami, Kolouri, and Pilly 2019; Ostapenko et al. 2019). CLOM differs from these approaches as it does not replay any old task data to prevent forgetting and can function with/without saving some old data. Parameter isolation is yet another popular approach, which makes different subsets (which may overlap) of the model parameters dedicated to different tasks using masks (Fernando et al. 2017; Serr`a et al. 2018; Ke, Liu, and Huang 2020) or ﬁnding a sub-network for each task by pruning (Mallya and Lazebnik 2017; Wortsman et al. 2020; Hung et al. 2019). CLOM uses parameter isolation, but it differs from these approaches as it combines the idea of parameter isolation and OOD detection, which can solve both TIL and CIL problems effectively."

The top two show the results of WSSS models, and the bottom two for FSSS models. From PC samples, we can see that many of the failure regions (highlighted with white dash boxes) using baseline models were corrected by adding MEA losses. This is a gain of strengthening the semantics and details on every individual layer of the model. On the top of it, using the overall SR loss makes the models more effective to mark out minor object parts, e.g., “horse legs” and “horse tail”. On both datasets, we also saw some failure cases. For example when segmenting “monitors”, all models are missing “neck” regions (see green dashed boxes). We think the reason is that the pseudo mask module (which is basically a classiﬁcation model) in WSSS rarely attends to “monitor neck” when training the classiﬁer of “monitor”. Another failure case is on the second row of CS: tiny objects such as distant trafﬁc signs are missing. We believe those signs are"

An autoencoder is a special form of feed-forward neural network made of two parts, the encoder and the decoder. The encoder transforms the input by reducing its number of dimensions to a value deﬁned as the coding dimension, and the decoder tries to map the encoded input back to the original input. It is trained by minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the reconstructed features and the input. In order to use this principle for anomaly detection, an autoencoder is trained with benign data, learning how to reconstruct it, such that it has a low reconstruction error on future benign data and a high reconstruction error on anything that deviates from benign data.

Multisource data includes maintenance reports of previous failure cases, written with a lessons-learned perspective, product descriptions and specifications, as well as design project structures and details from the semiconductor design. Since the obtained data was originally generated in a very specific context, which is the microchip design, it contains a considerable amount of symbolic descriptions, free textual inputs and remarks for the lessons-learned context, as well as semi-structured texts that include a considerable amount of misspellings, non-standard abbreviations, incomplete sentences and, in some cases, multiple languages. Handling those cases is an essential step to create a valid descriptive model of each document, which in turn will be the enabler for connecting those documents and mining the relations among them. To accomplish this goal, we utilize the previously described text mining pipeline as the first step to reduce undesired or error- containing tokens in the textual data. However, since standard text mining methods are not sufficient to create meaningful representations of the domain specific documents in hand, an extended text mining algorithm was built as a pipeline (Fig.1) that integrates an expert- and data-driven, rule-based, approach to handle domain specific differences in the textual data. After defining the multiple formats of documents from the available dataset, all texts have been extracted from those individual documents. Then, non-symbolic special characters are removed, along with specific patterns that are automatically generated from the database’s software. The remaining text is then filtered form punctuation and tokenized. The resulting tokens are lemmatized and stemmed in different phases of the procedure. Resulting tokens are also the input for the expert-supported part, where firstly, standard abbreviations are identified and isolated. Then, special symbols that are domain-specific, such as multiple underscores, are also reconstructed so that they are handled similarly between the multiple document sources.  With the reduction of non-meaningful tokens, a representative model of each document is constructed. Document models serve the goal of representing a full document with a vector of features, which is reliable to describe the extended content of the original document. In this paper, we utilize the TF-IDF algorithm (Equ.1) to extract most descriptive tokens from a document, as well as from the overall sum of available documents. In the microchip design use case, term frequency 𝑡𝑓 is capable of detecting meaningful repeating words in a design document, such as the term “oscillator” or “processor”. However, this part of the TF-IDF also detects non-relevant frequent words, such as “volt”, which do not hold a unique meaning in the document, although it is considerably frequent. This is why the IDF part enters the process, in order to balance the discovered terms identified in the TF part."

The idea behind PAWS is to create a dataset that has a high lexical overlap between sentence pairs without them being ‘paraphrases.’ It has 108k paraphrase and non-paraphrase pairs with high lexical overlap pairs generated by controlled word swapping and back-translation, and human raters have judged whether or not they are paraphrases. Including PAWS in the training data has shown the state-of-the-art models’ performance to jump from 40% to 85% on PAWS’s test split.

2010.0562,dataset,,,"Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) models are powerful for studying the associations between two sets of variables. The canonically correlated representations, termed canonical variates are widely used in unsupervised learning to analyze unlabeled multi-modal registered datasets. Despite their success, CCA models may break (or overﬁt) if the number of variables in either of the modalities exceeds the number of samples. Moreover, often a signiﬁcant fraction of the variables measures modality-speciﬁc information, and thus removing them is beneﬁcial for identifying the canonically correlated variates. Here, we propose ‘0-CCA, a method for learning correlated representations based on sparse subsets of variables from two observed modalities. Sparsity is obtained by multiplying the input variables by stochastic gates, whose parameters are learned together with the CCA weights via an ‘0-regularized correlation loss. We further propose ‘0-Deep CCA for solving the problem of non-linear sparse CCA by modeling the correlated representations using deep nets. We demonstrate the eﬃcacy of the method using several synthetic and real examples. Most notably, by gating nuisance input variables, our approach improves the extracted representations compared to other linear, non-linear and sparse CCA-based models."

Hence, direct minimization of the Bellman error can result in signiﬁcantly biased Qfunction estimates. We explain why ﬁxing the target Q-network in Deep Q-Networks and Fitted Q Evaluation provides a way of overcoming this confounding, thus shedding new light on this popular but not well understood trick in the deep RL literature. An alternative approach to address confounding is to leverage techniques developed in the causality literature, notably instrumental variables (IV). We bring together here the literature on IV and RL by investigating whether IV approaches can lead to improved Q-function estimates. This paper analyzes and compares a wide range of recent IV methods in the context of oﬄine policy evaluation (OPE), where the goal is to estimate the value of a policy using logged data only. By applying diﬀerent IV techniques to OPE, we are not only able to recover previously proposed OPE methods such as modelbased techniques but also to obtain competitive new techniques. We ﬁnd empirically that state-of-the-art OPE methods are closely matched in performance by some IV methods such as AGMM, which were not developed for OPE1.

Otherwise, the energy/area overheads can easily eclipse the speedup gains. To that end, we propose to exploit structured sparsity, which has regular sparsity patterns that allow the hardware additions required to be very lean. In particular, we focus on Density Bound Block (DBB) [26] format, which tiles data tensors into blocks, and then introduces a bound on the maximum number of non-zero elements per block. DBB overcomes both of the challenges with random sparsity. Firstly, the maximum number of MAC operations is ﬁxed, which signiﬁcantly achieves high PE utilization without operand buffers. Secondly, the blocked data limits the location of output results, eliding distributed accumulators."

Nonetheless, the method has some limitations, speciﬁcally, tuning λ requires a cross validation procedure, which could be costly in high dimensional regime.

Consequently, the connection request must be authenticated and authorized by the 3GPP network differently from a normal UAV-C, UAV, or UE. The 3GPP network must follow certain policies regarding the unsuccessful authentication and authorization where the UAAF may inform the SMF to prevent the registration and/or the cancellation of illegitimate PDU sessions by an unapproved UAV or UAV-C. Potential threats: A weak UAS authentication process can grant access to an untrusted UAV or UAV-C to receive UAS services via the 3GPP network. This can cause leakage of critical data such as UAS system capabilities, location, and encryption keys. Unauthorized UAVs may attempt to imitate the behavior of legitimate UAVs to launch man-inthe-middle or replay attacks [13].

In these cases, interference can also be managed at the protocol level, using so-called non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes [109] or rate-splitting (RS) [110]. The NOMA techniques are mainly based on two domains: power and code [111]. Power-domain NOMA refers to the superposition of multiple messages using diﬀerent transmit power, such that users with higher SNRs can decode interfering signals before decoding their own signal, while users with lower SNRs can treat interference as noise. Code-domain NOMA refers to the use of non-orthogonal spreading codes, which provide the users with higher SNRs after despreading, at the expense of additional interference. RS is based on dividing the users’ messages into private and common parts. Each user decodes its private part and the common parts to extract its data. RS can be viewed as a generalization of power/code-domain NOMA."

Most of the available deep paired SISR networks are trained under a setting where LR images are generated by downsampling HR images (from datasets such as Set5, Set14, DIV2K [1], BSD100 [2] etc) using a known kernel (often bicubic). These networks are trained using either a pixel wise Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss e.g. [15], [23], [28], L1 loss e.g. [46], Charbonnier loss e.g. [24] or a combination of pixel-wise L1 or L2 loss, perceptual loss [22] and adversarial loss [18] e.g. [25], [39], [12], [38]. Even though these networks perform really well in terms of PSNR and SSIM, and the GAN based ones produce images that are highly realistic, these networks often fail when they are applied on real images with unseen degradations such as realistic noise and blur. Image deblurring and denoising are challenging inverse problems in their own right and most works in these areas deal with uniform blur and ﬁxed noise models. In a recent work [33], the authors use deformable convolution layers to adaptively change the size of receptive ﬁeld to tackle non-uniform blur. However, this work deals with only clean images. To address this, RealSR [8] dataset was introduced in NTIRE 2019 Challenge [7] containing images taken at two diﬀerent focal lengths of a camera. Networks like [21], [16], [17] were trained on this dataset and are therefore robust to real degradations."

In a scenario where each client’s dataset has its own distribution, it aims at reducing the heterogeneity of the models sent by each client. Thus, s-Resampling is meant to be combined with a robust aggregation function to reduce the side-eﬀects of using such a function on nonIID models. Note that combining s-Resampling with AVG is useless, as the result is always exactly the same as when only using AVG. It operates by replacing each model by the average between 𝑠 models randomly sampled from the 𝐾 clients models. Each model can be sampled a maximum of 𝑠 times in total. Algorithm 2 is a slightly adapted version of the second algorithm from [20]. Indeed, s-Resampling may also cause the malicious models to be diluted into several of the models that it outputs, increasing the reach of the malicious clients. For that reason, it is only expected to work satisfyingly with a small number of malicious clients, a small value of 𝑠, and with an aggregation function that gets rid of a high number of extreme values, such as MED or TM(2)."

Otherwise, there is no need for Theorem 2 to assume the generalized Laplacian noise and the full-rankness of state transitions at all. In this paper, an alternative way is to exploit the (temporal) nonstationarity of the data caused by changing noise distribution (hence called nonstationary noise condition). We assume the functions of the temporal causal inﬂuences denoted by fi remain the same across across the |u| regimes or domains of data we have observed, but the distributions p(cid:15)i|u, of noise terms that serve as arguments to the structural equation models, may change. One special case of this principle uses nonstationary variances, i.e., the noise variances change across nonstationary regimes. This kind of perturbation has been widely used in linear ICA (Matsuoka et al., 1995). Additionally, the nonstationary noise condition in this paper allows for any kinds of modulation of noise distribution by nonstationary regimes u, such as changing distributional forms, scale, and location by u, as long as the modulated sources satisfy sufﬁcient variability condition described below."

1710.02907,"data, package",,,"information is preserved in the decompressed image [4, 6, 9, 10]. In medical imaging, lossy compression can sometimes achieve a minute compression before a good percentage of information is dropped. More compression can be achieved if some visible losses can be tolerated for clinical task purposes. There are still a lot of controversies as to what the real life applications of lossy compressions are, especially in the medical domain. One other approach to lossy compression is the machine learning approach where images are encoded with sparse feature representations using neural networks [14, 15, 16]. Generally speaking, lossless compression can be categorized into three broad categories, namely: predictive scheme with statistical modeling, transform based coding and ﬁnally, dictionary based coding. The predictive deals with using statistical method to evaluate the differences between pixels and their neighbors, and performed context modeling before coding. Whereas in transform based compression, pixel are transformed using frequency or wavelet transformation before modeling and coding. Dictionary based compression is the third category and it deals with replacing strings of symbols with shorter codes. It must be noted that dictionary based schemes are widely used for text compression [17]. An example of a dictionary based algorithm is the well known ZIP package. Other dictionary based compression algorithms for image data are the Lempel-Ziv-Welsh (LZW), Portable Network Graphics (PNG), Graphics Interchange Format, and so on. A good number of image data compression paradigms have been investigated in recent past. The least squares adaptive prediction scheme was proposed in [18] for lossless compression of natural images and it was shown that the novel scheme improves the computational complexity with negligible performance trade-off. Lossless compression based on adaptive spectral band re-ordering and adaptive backward previous closest neighbors (PCN) algorithms was also proposed in [19, 20] for hyperspectral images, and it was shown that the compression performance was greatly enhanced with the implementation of both the re-ordering of spectral band. The problem of compression in medical applications has also been studied in [21] where different types of compression standards on grayscale medical images were compared by highlighting the pros and cons of various compression methods. In [1], problems of video compression were addressed taking cognizance of the temporary spectral information. Also in [22], the possibility of using 3-D versions of the lossless JPEG spatial predictors was considered and the likelihood of using best predictor to encode the present frame was investigated. The spectral redundancy was also exploited by implementing the best predictor from one spectral component to another spectral component. It can be inferred from [22] that pixels in a given neighborhood are concurrent in adjoining color bands. To improve on this, a different predictor for interband correlation was proposed in [23]. In [24], a simple context predictive scheme was also proposed where either intraframe or interframe coding is selected based on temporal and spatial variations, and the prediction of the current pixel was then computed. A good number of predictors were considered taking cognizance of the spatial redundancy. In addition, a variation of singular value decomposition (SVD) based image compression was proposed in [25] which is an extension on the conventional SVD-based compression. Image data was ﬁrst preprocessed using data independent permutation prior to computing SVD, and in the reconstruction algorithm, inverse permutation was used to post-process the output of the conventional SVD-based decompression algorithm. Many compression algorithms have been proposed for a wide range of imaging domains such as DNA microarray images [26] and multimedia image data [27]. Improving the lossless compression of images with sparse histogram was addressed in [29] and its robustness was shown on other types of images. Both lossy and lossless compression was investigated in a uniﬁed framework and a new cost effective coding strategy was proposed to enhance the coding efﬁciency. A motion-JPEG-LS based lossless scheme was also proposed in [8] and the work only explores high enough correlation between adjacent image frames in order to avoid possible coding loss and abrupt high computational cost. Wavelet-based lossy to lossless compression methods have also been addressed for ECG [30] and for volumetric medical images [31]. Lossless digital audio compression scheme was addressed in [32]. The main contribution of this paper is to propose new near-lossless compression heuristics and benchmark their performance with DCT and FWHT-based compression paradigms in term of computational complexity and compression ratio. The algorithms have been implemented taking into consideration the three important ﬁgure-of-merit namely: the compression efﬁciency, easiness of use, and speed of computation. The design requires no complicated parameter selection nor special digital signal processing hardware add-on.

Here, we ﬁrst discuss the p and λ in the pretext task. We adjust p and λ to obtain a pseudo label matrix. Usually, we ﬁne-tune the two parameters according to the ﬁnal results (as an example, in our paper, we can adjust the two parameters by the recognition accuracy). Here, we give a trick to easier ensure the two optimal parameters. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst use the training data to generate a model with p and λ. Then employ the training model to compute the cross-entropy loss of testing data. At last, adjust the parameters until achieving the minimum loss. The inﬂuence of p and λ are separately shown in Figure 4(b), 4(c). The yaxis denotes the testing data’s loss. We obtain the minimum loss near p = 2.2 and λ = 0.1. For α and γ, they interact with each other. Thus we explore the impact of these two parameters simultaneously. Figure 4(d) shows the experimental results.

2201.10154,data,,,"The classic studies of causal emergence have revealed that in some Markovian dynamical systems, far stronger causal connections can be found on the higher-level descriptions than the lower-level of the same systems if we coarse-grain the system states in an appropriate way. However, identifying this emergent causality from the data is still a hard problem that has not been solved because the correct coarse-graining strategy can not be found easily. This paper proposes a general machine learning framework called Neural Information Squeezer to automatically extract the eﬀective coarse-graining strategy and the macro-state dynamics, as well as identify causal emergence directly from the time series data. By decomposing a coarse-graining operation into two processes: information conversion and information dropping out, we can not only exactly control the width of the information channel, but also can derive some important properties analytically including the exact expression of the eﬀective information of a macro-dynamics. We also show how our framework can extract the dynamics on diﬀerent levels and identify causal emergence from the data on several exampled systems."

2008.01391,"code, data",,,"From our comprehensive survey, we can see that orthographic information improves translation quality in all types of machine translation from rule-based to completely unsupervised systems like bilingual lexicon induction. For the rule-based machine translation, translation between the closely related language is simpliﬁed to transliteration due to the cognates. Statistical machine translation deals with data sparsity problem by using orthographic information. Since statistical machine translation has been studied a long time, most of the orthographic properties are studies for different types of languages. Even the recent neural machine translation and other methods still use preprocessing tools such as true-casers, tokenizers, and detokenizers that are developed for statistical machine translation. Recent neural machine translation is completely end-to-end, however, it suffers from data sparsity when dealing with morphologically rich languages or under-resourced languages. These issues are dealt by utilising orthographic information in neural machine translation. One such method which improves the translation is a transliteration of cognates. Codeswitching is another issue with under-resourced languages due to the data collected from voluntary annotator, web crawling or other such methods. However, dealing with code-switching based on orthography or using character-based neural machine translation has been shown to improve the results signiﬁcantly."

1710.02907,data,,,"concatenating zipper transform. In fact, the interlacing zipping operation is abstracted from the way two separate entities can be fastened and tightened with a zipping tool. In the case of interlacingZT, the imaginary parts of the complex numbers in the upper half of the symmetry are stripped off and interlaced with their corresponding real counterparts. In this conﬁguration, the structural arrangement of the imaginary parts and real part guides against arbitrary variation of pixel intensities in the spatial domain. In the concatenating ZT (or simply ZT) on the other hand, the imaginary parts of the complex numbers in the upper half of the symmetry are stripped off and concatenated with their corresponding real counterparts. It is noted that this transformation is near-lossless. Also, the two-dimensional zipper transformation is implemented as a two 1D ZT in sequence by ﬁrst performing a 1D ZT on columns and then doing another 1D ZT on rows. This procedure is reversed in the inverse zipper transformation. Fig. 1 illustrates the zipper and inverse-zipper transformations and Fig. 2 illustrates the implementation of interlacing-zipper and inverse-interlacing-zipper transformations using a 10 1 vector. It is remarked that the number of elements in the vector before ZT stays the same after the transformation, that is, ZT preserves the dimensionality of the input data. For images, the input vector illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2 is the columns or rows of the multidimensional array representing the image of interest."

We aim to annotate “natural” conversations, and therefore bias our selection of datasets towards those that are obtained using a Wizard-of-Oz setup. Annotating dialogues, however, is an inherently complex task, where it is a challenge to keep the cognitive load sufficiently low for crowd workers. This leads us to a secondary research question: What are effective designs for collecting large-scale annotations for conversational data? Although a large body of research exists on effective designs for collecting large-scale entity annotations [1, 6, 29, 41], to the best of our knowledge, there is no work on conversational data. We run a number of pilot experiments using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to select the best design and instruction. Based on these experiments, we develop the Conversational Entity Linking (ConEL) dataset, consisting of of 100 annotated dialogues (708 user utterances) sampled from the QuAC [16], MultiWOZ [62], WoW [24], and TREC CAsT 2020 [21] datasets. To enable further study in conversational EL, we also annotate a separate sample of 25 WoW dialogues (containing references to personal entities) and all 25 manually rewritten dialogues of TREC CAsT 2020."
2107.10483,data,,,"Many scenarios of predicting false positive edges can, in theory, be solved by providing an undirected skeleton of the graph, for example, obtained from observational data. Still, one of the cornerstones of ENCO is that it does not assume faithfulness. Without faithfulness or any other assumption on the functional form of the causal mechanisms, the correct undirected graph cannot be recovered by any method. One of the future directions will be to include faithfulness in ENCO to solve the scenarios mentioned above, although this would imply that we might not be able to recover edges of deterministic variables anymore."

After the ROI-ROI based pairwise matching, the output for each pair is a feature vector embedding the similarity of the given two acquisitions, with each element associated with a ROI. By visualizing the value distribution over ROIs, we can interpret the learned pairwise feature vector of our model. Fig. 4 reports the most 10 similar or dissimilar ROI for PD or HC groups. The similarities are directly extracted from the output representations of the pairwise matching layer. We compute the averaged values of certain groups. For instance, the similarity distributions are computed given the pairwise PD samples, and the values of the top-10 ROI are shown in Fig. 4(a). According to the results, lateral orbitofrontal area, middle temporal and amygdala areas are the three most similar ROIs for PD patients, while important ROIs such as caudate and putamen areas are discriminative to distinguish PD and HC (see Fig. 4(d)). The observations demonstrate that the learned pairwise feature vectors are consistent with some clinical discoveries [36] and thus verify the effectiveness of the MVGCN for neuroimage analysis."

Due to privacy and security issues, the original datasets are usually unavailable directly. Recently, federated learning proposes a popular distributed machine learning paradigm with an enhanced privacy protection mechanism. It offers a practical and secure framework for data owners to collaborate with others, thus obtaining a better global model trained on the larger dataset. However, due to the high complexity of transformer models, the convergence process becomes slow and unstable in the federated learning setting. Besides, the transformer model trained in federated learning is costly communication and limited computational speed on clients, impeding its popularity. To deal with these challenges, we propose the federated dynamic transformer. On the one hand, the performance is greatly improved comparing with the federated transformer, approaching centralize-trained Transformer-TTS when increasing clients number. On the other hand, it achieves faster and more stable convergence in the training phase and signiﬁcantly reduces communication time.

Much research has been recently devoted to deal with such restrictions and on how to reconcile distributed systems with such legislation frameworks [16]. For instance, [49] showed that it is possible to deploy real timeprocessing of heart-rate variability (HRV, linked to physiological and mental stress [17, 52]) by exploiting Intel SGX TEE enclaves with reasonable overheads.

Besides, ours outperforms FedT-TTS in terms of client’s numbers. On the other hand, ours hugely reduces the total training time by around 20% in different clients number with the superior performance. Especially in a 5-clients situation, FedDT-TTS’s time cost is 49.26h, almost 30% reduction compared with FedT-TTS, 66.42h.

Fig. 3 quantiﬁes the energy and area overhead of the FIFOs used for distributing matching pairs for INT8 operands. We compare the energy and area across four designs: a dense systolic array (SA), a systolic array with ZVCG optimization (SA-ZVCG), and two variants of SA-SMT, a recent systolic array that exploits random sparsity using operand FIFOs [38]. The two SA-SMT variants differ by their FIFO depths; one uses 2-entry FIFOs (SMT-T2Q2) and the other uses 4-entry FIFOs (SMT-T2Q4). The PPA is obtained for a typical convolution layer with 50% weight and activation sparsity.

2203.0248,"dataset, data repos",,,"Very recently, several approaches introduced Transformer-like architectures (Vaswani et al., 2017) which outperformed previous RNN-based ones (Yasar and Iqbal, 2021; Wang et al., 2021b; Guo et al., 2021; Katircioglu et al., 2021). Yasar and Iqbal (2021) proposed to encode individually the multiple agents’ joints positions, velocities, and accelerations. Then, cross-agent attention was applied among the latent space to generate socially aware representations, which followed two subsequent paths. First, these representations went through a two-streams adversarial discriminator that sampled discrete and continuous latent variables. The authors reported that such conﬁguration favored the latent space interpretability. Their analysis on such variables showed that their method eﬀectively captured the underlying dynamics of human motion. Finally, the socially aware latent representations underwent individual recurrent decoders that autoregressively predicted the future sequence of poses. The independent generation of poses represented its main limitation, as generated poses might not be socially coherent. Wang et al. (2021b) proposed to encode local- and global-range dependencies (intra- and inter-personal dependencies, respectively) with two specialized transformer encoders. The past motion of the person of interest was transformed by means of a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) (Ahmed et al., 1974), which was then fed to the local-range transformer performing self-attention. At the same time, the global-range transformer encoder applied self-attention across diﬀerent subjects and diﬀerent time steps. A spatial positional encoding was added to the global encodings to help the network cluster diﬀerent individuals in diﬀerent social interaction groups. Finally, the transformer decoder leveraged the last observed pose as the query, and the local- and global-range encodings as both keys and values in order to generate the whole predicted sequence at once, which was then fed to a linear and an Inverse DCT layer. Additionally, an adversarial loss was used to ensure the realism of the generated behavior. The authors argued that, by predicting the whole motion sequence at once, they prevented generating freezing motion. They reported state-of-the-art and qualitative impressive results in various datasets with several prediction window lengths (up to 3 seconds) and synthetically generated crowded scenarios (up to 15 people).

We have also applied DCDI (Brouillard et al., 2020) to the real-world datasets and report the results in Table 9 and 10. DCDI performs relatively similar to SDI, making a few more mistakes on the very small graphs (< 10 nodes) while being slightly better on sachs and child. Nonetheless, ENCO outperforms DCDI on all graphs. We do not report results of DCDI on the largest graphs, diabetes and pigs, because it ran out of memory for diabetes (larger number of max. categories per variable) and did not converge within the same time limitations as SDI and ENCO (see Section 4.3 for a comparison on scalability)."

2004.14247,data,,,"Massive MIMO is a cellular technology where the access points are equipped with a large number of antennas, which are utilized for spatial multiplexing of many data streams per cell to one or, preferably, multiple users. The massive MIMO technology has become synonymous with 5G, but the hardware implementation and algorithms that are used diﬀer to a large extent from what was originally proposed in [11] and then described in textbooks on the topic [12, 13]. For example, compact 64-antenna rectangular panels with limited angular resolution in the azimuth and elevation domains are being used instead of physically large horizontal uniform linear arrays with hundreds of antennas, which would lead to very narrow azimuth beams. Moreover, a beam-space approach is taken where 2D discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebooks are used to describe grids of 64 beams in predetermined angular directions for rectangular panels, while only one of these 64 predeﬁned beams is selected for each user. This approach is only appropriate for line-ofsight (LOS) communication with calibrated planar arrays and widely spaced users. In general, non-LOS channels contain arbitrary linear combinations of those beams, the arrays might have diﬀerent geometry, and the array responses of imperfectly calibrated arrays are not described by a DFT. A practical reason for these design simpliﬁcations is that analog and hybrid beamforming were needed to come quickly to the market in 5G. However, fully digital arrays will be available for a wide range of frequencies (including mmWave) when 6G arrives and, therefore, we should utilize it to implement something capable of providing a performance substantially closer to what the massive MIMO theory suggests [12, 13]. Since the massive MIMO terminology has become diluted by many suboptimal design choices in 5G, we will use the term ultra-massive MIMO [14] in this paper to describe the 6G version of the technology."

For the similarity I, we observe that BOSSC achieves the best performance while other methods return nearly similar results. We remark that BOSS-T yields the largest PMF distance D since the requirement of inducing misclassiﬁcations to the target label (i.e., ensuring the mode of the distribution occurs at the target class) can still be attained by relaxing the distance upper bound δc to a relatively large value. BOSS-U yields the smallest JS distance since the outputs pm(x ; θ), ∀m ∈ [M ] of all nodes need to be equal (uniform distribution). Similar observations are noticed for BOSS-C and BOSS-B. This experiment underscores the ﬂexibility of our framework in achieving the goal of each application as speciﬁed by xd, pd, δc, and δs."
2203.0248,"data, dataset",,,"Regarding the content released, although originally available, some of them did not release the audio of the videos showcased due to privacy concerns. This is especially frequent for egocentric videos, as the unconstrained recording of the interactions obstructs the collection of consent forms. Other common content typologies consist of psychological data (e.g., personality questionnaires), biosignals monitoring (e.g., heart rate, electrocardiogram, electroencephalograms) and transcriptions. The latter is considerably less frequent due to its tedious manual annotation process (McCowan et al., 2005; Douglas-Cowie et al., 2007; McKeown et al., 2010; L¨ucking et al., 2012; Vella and Paggio, 2013; Vandeventer et al., 2015; Naim et al., 2015; Chou et al., 2017; Paggio and Navarretta, 2017; Cafaro et al., 2017; Joo et al., 2019b; Kossaiﬁ et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020; Khan et al., 2020; Palmero et al., 2022). The most frequent low-level annotations that the datasets provide are the participants’ body poses and facial expressions (Douglas-Cowie et al., 2007; Rehg et al., 2013; Bilakhia et al., 2015; Vandeventer et al., 2015; Naim et al., 2015; Edwards et al., 2016; Cafaro et al., 2017; Feng et al., 2017; Georgakis et al., 2017; Paggio and Navarretta, 2017; Bozkurt et al., 2017; Andriluka et al., 2018; von Marcard et al., 2018; Mehta et al., 2018; Lemaignan et al., 2018; Joo et al., 2019b; Kossaiﬁ et al., 2019; Schiphorst et al., 2020; Doyran et al., 2021; Palmero et al., 2022). Given their annotation complexity, they are usually automatically retrieved with tools like OpenPose (Cao et al., 2019), and manually ﬁxed or discarded. Others use more complex retrieval systems like motion capture, or mocap (Edlund et al., 2010; Maman et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2021). However, the characteristics of the mocap recording setup and the special suit that participants wear could unintentionally bias the elicited behaviors during the interaction. Finally, the annotation of high-level social signals is often led by the needs of the study for which the dataset was collected. Indeed, some of the datasets have been complementary annotated and added in posterior studies. As a result, most common high-level labels consist of elicited emotions (McCowan et al., 2005; Douglas-Cowie et al., 2007; van Son et al., 2008; McKeown et al., 2010; Naim et al., 2015; Vandeventer et al., 2015; Chou et al., 2017; Paggio and Navarretta, 2017; Maman et al., 2020; Doyran et al.,"

The data augmentation focused on the frequency acoustic features and consisted in warping them over time, masking blocks of utterances, and masking blocks of consecutive frequency channels. A similar technique was explored for the head pose, which was also warped in space and time, and masked over time. The experiments showed important improvements when forecasting head nodding with the combination of these strategies and an LSTM. Another big challenge is the extremely time-consuming annotation of social datasets. In the backchannel scenario, the highly multimodal nature of an interaction requires the annotator to pay attention to the audio, speech, and visual content before making a decision. This process is tedious and prone to errors. Very recently, Jain and Leekha (2021) proposed a semi-supervised method for identiﬁcation of listener backchannels that was able to detect up to the 90% of the backchannels with only a small subset of labeled data (25%). More importantly, it identiﬁed the type of the signals associated around 85% of the times. The authors showed that models trained on such noisy labels were able to keep a 93% and a 96% of the performance with respect to those trained with the cleaned annotations for the tasks of backchannel opportunity prediction and signal classiﬁcation, respectively. Their general methodology can be adapted for other conversational datasets. Although its validation in other datasets is still pending, it represents an important ﬁrst step to speed-up the annotation processes and reduce the workforce that they require."

Gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), obtained from ECG data is employed for features vector description due to its exceptional statistical feature extraction ability in [42]. In [43], ECG signals were segmented into heartbeats and each of the heartbeats were transformed to 2D grayscale images which were input to CNN. In [44], two second segments of ECG signal are transformed to recurrence plot images to classify arrhythmia in two steps using deep learning model.

We then computed the statistics of two image quality metrics, the NRMSE and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) [41], and plotted them against the zero-padding rate. Markedly, the results of the three algorithms exhibit the same behaviour: their NRMSE and SSIM values improve consistently with the zero-padding extent (Figure 5). This improvement is completely artiﬁcial and stems only from the data processing. Strikingly, for the 2x zero-padding case, which is often the default in commercial scanners, the NRMSE exhibits a large improvement of 26%-42% (Table 1)."

2107.10483,data,,,"Causal structure learning algorithms such as the proposed method are mainly used to uncover and understand causal mechanisms from data. The knowledge of the underlying causal mechanisms can then be applied to decide on speciﬁc actions that inﬂuence variables or factors in a desired way. For instance, by knowing that the environmental pollution in a city has an impact on the risk of cancer of its residents, one can try to reduce the pollution to decrease the risk of cancer. The applications of causal structure learning are ranging across many scientiﬁc disciplines, including computational biology (Friedman et al., 2000; Sachs et al., 2005; Opgen-Rhein & Strimmer, 2007), epidemiology (Robins et al., 2000; Vandenbroucke et al., 2016), and economics (Pearl, 2009; Hicks et al., 1980). We envision that our work can have positive impacts on those ﬁelds. One example we want to highlight is the ﬁeld of genomics. Recent advances have enabled to perform gene knockdown experiments in a large scale, providing large amounts of interventional data (Dixit et al., 2016; Macosko et al., 2015). Gaining insights into how speciﬁc genes and diseases interact can lead to the development of novel pharmaceutic methods for treating current diseases. Since the number of variables in those experiments is tremendous, efﬁcient causal structure learning algorithms are needed. The proposed method constitutes a ﬁrst step towards this goal, and our work can foster future work for creating algorithms scaling beyond 10,000 variables."

Compared to previous work, ENCO models the edge orientations as separate parameters and uses an objective unconstrained with respect to acyclicity. This allows for easier optimization and low-variance gradient estimators while having convergence guarantees. As a consequence, the algorithm can efﬁciently scale to graphs that are at least one order of magnitude larger graphs than what was possible. Experiments corroborate the capabilities of ENCO compared to the state-of-the-art on an extensive array of settings on graph sizes, sizes of observational and interventional data, latent confounding, as well as on both partial and full intervention sets."

In particular, the network’s uncertainties, (the neural network outputs a real number and not a class), are generally small enough to allow the correct classiﬁcation on the corresponding Ω, on the contrary the Bayes inference leads to a miss-classiﬁcation of the rotation parameter. A quantitative comparison of the two techniques is presented in Fig. 9, where in the four panels we report a scatterplot between the correct rotation value, Ωtrue and the corresponding prediction obtained via the DCNN (top left panel), and the Bayes inference with the three diﬀerent likelihoods, namely the one based on the mean energy (top right panel), on the mean square gradients (bottom left panel) and on the joint likelihood combining energy and gradients (bottom right panel). The four panels are all obtained with the same validation dataset of roughly 20 thousands planes for each of the ten Ω values. The symbols size and color intensity are proportional to the density of points in the speciﬁc region of the scatterplot, while the open hexagon in black represents the mean value measure over all planes for each Ω.

Even though our primary goal was to estimate the position of a mobile agent, we needed the AI to move autonomously in order to obtain data and conduct tests. Using equation 7, the AI can ﬁnd the most probable hidden state and deﬁne it as its estimate of its opponent’s position at each turn. This position is generally deﬁned as the goal in the path-ﬁnding literature. Considering each state as a node in a graph, we implemented the Dijkstra’s algorithm [12] to let the AI determine the shortest path to that estimate and start moving towards it. At each turn, the AI determines a new goal, calculates the distance between the goal and each of its surrounding positions, and chooses a position to move from among these surrounding positions."
2202.12674,data,,,"Abstract—Machine learning algorithms must be able to efﬁciently cope with massive data sets. Therefore, they have to scale well on any modern system and be able to exploit the computing power of accelerators independent of their vendor. In the ﬁeld of supervised learning, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are widely used. However, even modern and optimized implementations such as LIBSVM or ThunderSVM do not scale well for large nontrivial dense data sets on cutting-edge hardware: Most SVM implementations are based on Sequential Minimal Optimization, an optimized though inherent sequential algorithm. Hence, they are not well-suited for highly parallel GPUs. Furthermore, we are not aware of a performance portable implementation that supports CPUs and GPUs from different vendors."

2004.14247,code,,,"The channel coding scheme used in 6G high-reliability scenarios must provide a lower error ﬂoor and better “waterfall” performance than that in 5G. Short and moderate length codes with excellent performance need to be considered. Polar codes, due to their error correction capabilities and lack of error ﬂoor, might be the preferred choice in 6G. However, state-of-the-art CRC-aided successive cancellation list decoding doesn’t scale up well with throughput due to the serial nature of the algorithm. Hence, iterative algorithms that can be parallelized need to be developed [95]. In [96], a new variant of the multi-trellis BP decoder is proposed, which permutes only a subgraph of the original factor graph. This enables the decoder to retain information of variable nodes in the subgraphs, which are not permuted, reducing the required number of iterations needed in-between the permutations. As a result, the proposed decoder can perform permutations more frequently, hence being more eﬀective in mitigating the eﬀect of cycles, which cause oscillation errors. Work in [97] proposes some new algorithms to process new types of node patterns that appear within multiple levels of pruned sub-trees, and it enables to process certain nodes in parallel. Furthermore, modiﬁed polar code constructions can be adopted to improve the performance of iterative algorithms, potentially with the aid of machine learning such as deep unfolding [98, 99]. These approaches could lead to better communication performance but will require signiﬁcant advances in understanding the behavior, robustness, and generalization of neural networks."

2104.09994,data repos,,,"Another disadvantage is the synchronization required between clients when submitting their models for aggregation. A client that fails or is slow due to asynchrony may cause the server not to perform the training correctly [45]. Currently, the framework addresses this problem by setting a timeout for sending the models so that if one of the clients does not respond in time, it is skipped from that aggregation step. In this case, a Blockchain-based solution is also beneﬁcial since it can be used as an asynchronous repository where each client can publish its models each time it trains them locally. Despite its beneﬁts to solve both disadvantages, it is essential to consider that the use of Blockchain also brings with it a series of threats to cover, such as majority attacks or block validation attacks [46]."

All backends are optional, i.e., they are only conditionally included if the necessary hardware and software stack is available. The actual used backend can be selected at runtime. We use C++17 focusing on modern best practices and support switching between double and single precision ﬂoating point types by changing a single template parameter. The training of PLSSVM can be split into four steps: (1) read the whole training data set used to set up the system of linear equations (Equation 14), (2) load the training data onto the device, (3) solve the system of linear equations and writeback the solution to the host memory, and (4) save the learned support vectors with the corresponding weights to a model ﬁle.

Since GES assumes linear mechanisms and gaussianity of the data, it is unsurprising that it performs better on the linear Gaussian dataset than on the non-linear datasets. However, on all the three datasets, it constitutes the lowest performance compared to the other methods, including ENCO. This highlights the beneﬁts of incorporating interventional data in the learning of the skeleton and graph structure. To gain further insights in comparison to the constraint-based baseline, we repeat the experiments with smaller sample sizes. The original dataset has 909 samples for observational data and per intervention, and we sub-sample 500 and 100 of those respectively for simulating smaller dataset sizes. The results of those experiments can be found in Table 17. It is apparent that the results of GES on the linear dataset get considerably worse with fewer data samples being available, while ENCO-G is able to reconstruct most graphs still without errors. Especially for the small dataset of 100 samples, we noticed that the skeletons"

2105.05076,"data, dataset, database",,,"In the pre-processing phase, raw textual data is cleaned from undesired strings, or strings that are without meaning for the respective case, such as special characters and email addresses. After cleaning, the text is divided into smaller pieces that can be analyzed. This is referred to as tokenization, in which the large corpus is cut into sentences, phrases or words, each called a token. In tokenization, some identifiers such as punctuations can be used to separate the individual tokens. Tokens are then also scanned to eliminate less meaningful tokens that are referred to as stop words. Stop words can be [11]: punctuations or pronouns, frequent words or, in some cases, non-frequent vocabulary. Extra steps can be performed such as stemming and lemmatization, in which different forms of the same name or verb are turned back to their basic dictionary form. In the context of semantic representation, information extraction methods that can discover the relations between textual data points are of considerable importance. This is due to the role they play in mapping the extracted knowledge and linking its information in a queryable manner, where the user can navigate from a textual entry or a search term, reaching relevant information. Information extraction has traditional methods that are manually crafted in many cases [12]; as well as intelligent methods based on machine and especially deep learning [13], [14]. In [14], authors consider relation extraction as a classification problem, in which different predefined relation types can be used to recognize the belonging of a relation in the corpus to a certain category. In this context, probabilistic methods accompany deep learning methods to perform the classification. Such approaches have been utilized by the authors in [15] to extract relations from free textual data and an existing knowledge base. Their approach builds a domain specific knowledge graph, which can be queried in applications such as question answering and chatting. The graph is built on two levels, a static level from the predefined database, based on a domain specific terminology, and a dynamic graph that is built automatically from the free text. Relation extraction is conducted by the deep neural network through a matching task on a large training dataset. The resulting static and dynamic graphs are merged into one, allowing an effective knowledge representation and querying. Similar approaches can also be observed in [16]–[19]. With the development of search engines and the popularity they witnessed, retrieving the most relevant results for a search query got more focus in the literature. With textual data arranged in documents, several methods have been implemented for document matching, in order to find the result that best corresponds to a user input. A document in this context can be defined as a full or partial textual corpus, such as a paragraph or a sentence.  Document matching is essential in applications such as search engines, question answering and recommender systems. In such fields, the matched documents are also ranked and ordered according to their relevance to the user query [20]. Ranking can be based on a weighting criterion such as the well-known Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) approach, which measures the importance of frequent words in a document, in contrast to rarely existing words throughout a set of documents. The assumption in this algorithm is that a frequent word in one document can be a feature that describes the document content, which can also be the case for words that exist in only few documents within a larger dataset. This allows a more differentiated retrieval of documents when such feature words are included in the user query. 2.2 Knowledge Graphs"

2004.14247,data,,,"The beamforming challenge for 6G is to make use of physically large panels, since the dimensionality of the beamforming is equal to the number of antennas, and the beamwidth is inversely proportional to the array aperture. With an ultra-high spatial resolution, each transmitted signal can be focused in a small region around the receiver, leading to a beamforming gain proportional to the number of antennas. An ultra-high level of spatial multiplexing is also possible since each signal is only strong in a small region around the receiver. This is particularly important to make eﬃcient use of the low bands, where the channel coherence time is large and, therefore, can accommodate the channel estimation overhead for many users. With a suﬃcient number of antennas, 1 MHz of spectrum in the 1 GHz band can give the same data rate as 100 MHz of spectrum in the 100 GHz band.

As a result, our method can enforce the learned features to be distributed around the class weights. 3) We conduct extensive experiments on two domain adaptation tasks to verify the effectiveness of our proposed PCL, i.e., UDA and SSDA.

Therefore, there is a need to develop unsupervised (or self-supervised) methods that can be used to learn general-purpose models from unlabeled data. It is particularly pertinent to on-device learning (such as a smartphone), without the need for data aggregation in a centralized server, and minimal to no human involvement in terms of the annotation process. Consequently, the unsupervised model can be used as a semantic feature extractor or initialization for efﬁciently adapting to an end-task of interest through ﬁne-tuning with few-labeled instances."

If we want to design a deeper neural network with the leveled homomorphic encryption scheme, much impractically larger parameters have to be used, and it causes heavy run-time or memory overhead. Further, since the packing technique cannot be applied easily in the TFHE scheme, it can cause additional inefﬁciency with regard to the running time and the memory overhead if we want to process many data at once. Thus, it is desirable to use the FHE with moderate parameters and bootstrapping, which naturally supports the packing technique in the PPML model."

CONCLUSION We proposed two computationally efﬁcient multimodal fusion frameworks for ECG heart beat classiﬁcation called Multimodal Image Fusion (MIF) and Multimodal Feature Fusion (MFF).

In MIF, we ﬁrst perform image fusion by combining three input images to create a three channel single image which used as input to the CNN. In MFF, highly informative cues are pulled out from penultimate layer of CNN and they are fused and used as input for the SVM classiﬁer. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed fusion frameworks by performing experiments on PhysionNet’s MIT-BIH for ﬁve different arrhythmias and on PTB diagnostics dataset for MI classiﬁcation. Experimental results prove that we beat the previous state-of-the-art in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy, precision and recall.

Since SDI (Ke et al., 2019) has a similar learning structure as ENCO, we have implemented it in the same code base as ENCO.

In this case, the graph can violate the condition in Equation 23 since intervening on X2 breaks the dependency between X1 and X2. The X2) learned from observational data relies on the dependency between conditional distribution p(X3| X3 is X1 and X2 which can make it to a worse estimate than p(X3). Note that if the edge X1 → learned by ENCO though, this will not constitute a problem anymore since with conditioning on X1, X3 will gain a gradient towards the correct graph. Thus, when γ i.e. p(X3| and θ are not initialized with the worst-case values, the graph with both X1 and X2 as parents of X3 can be sampled and provides gradients in the correct direction. Further, we did not observe any of these situations in the synthetic and real-world graphs we experimented on."

We preprocess these signals, which are recorded at 100Hz, as done in earlier work [7] and utilize 30-second epochs (segments). For activity classiﬁcation with smartphones, accelerometer, and gyroscope signals from HHAR [52] and MobiAct [53] datasets are used, which have 6 and 11 output classes, respectively. We segment the raw signals through a sliding window into a segment size of 400 samples with a 50% overlap.

2110.05428,data,,,"Temporal dependencies and nonstationarities were recently used as side information u to achieve identiﬁability of nonlinear ICA on latent space z. Hyvarinen & Morioka (2016) proposed timecontrastive learning (TCL) based on the independent sources assumption. It gave the very ﬁrst identiﬁability results for a nonlinear mixing model with nonstationary data segmentation. Hyvarinen & Morioka (2017) developed a permutation-based contrastive (PCL) learning framework to separate independent sources using temporal dependencies. Their approach learns to discriminate between true time series and permuted time series, and the model is identiﬁable under the uniformly dependent assumption. Hälvä & Hyvarinen (2020) combined nonlinear ICA with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to automatically model nonstationarity without the need for manual data segmentation. Khemakhem et al. (2020) introduced VAEs to approximate the true joint distribution over observed and auxiliary nonstationary regimes. The conditional distribution in their work p(z|u) is assumed to be within exponential families to achieve identiﬁability on the latent space. A more recent study in causally-related nonlinear ICA was given by (Yang et al., 2021), which introduced a linear causal layer to transform independent exogenous factors into endogenous causal variables."

Since this section focuses on how to learn a single task based on OOD detection, we omit the task-id unless necessary. The OOD training process is similar to that of contrastive learning. It consists of two steps: 1) learning the feature representation by the composite g ◦ h, where h is a feature extractor and g is a projection to contrastive representation, and 2) learning a linear classiﬁer f mapping the feature representation of h to the label space. In the following, we describe the training process: contrastive learning for feature representation learning (1), and OOD classiﬁer building (2). We then explain how to make a prediction based on an ensemble method for both TIL and CIL settings, and how to further improve prediction using some saved past data."

2005.07667,"code, data, database",,,"The possibility to use a natural language statement to query a database has the potential to attract a vast majority of users that are not proﬁcient in using query languages such as the Structured Query Language (SQL). This language is the main query language for relational databases currently in use. The problem of text to SQL mapping could be viewed as a Semantic Parsing problem [1], which is deﬁned as transforming a natural language input into a machine-interpretable representation. Semantic parsing is a long-standing question and is a well-studied problem in Natural Language Processing (NLP). As such, it has attracted much attention both from academia and from the industry, especially translating natural language into SQL queries. A large amount of the data in today’s age is stored in relational databases for applications ranging from ﬁnancial and e-commerce domains to medical domains. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that querying a database using natural language has many different applications. It also opens up the prospects of having self-serving dashboards and dynamic analytics, where people not accustomed to the SQL language could use it to get the most relevant information for their business. The task of translating natural language to SQL has many related tasks such as code generation and schema these tasks could be ultimately combined generation. All"

However, the crypto primitives they provide are slower than expected, especially when compared to other state-of-the-art libraries (i.e., OpenSSL [5]). Our experimental results highlight a slowdown of up to two orders of magnitude. We hope to mitigate these drawbacks exploiting hardware support for TRUSTZONE-speciﬁc Cryptographic Hardware Accelerators such as ARM CRYPTOISLAND [8]. the Second, we have shown in our evaluation that mosquitto MQTT broker has a small CPU footprint. However, code executed in TRUSTZONE can only be singlethreaded, negatively affecting scalability. While leveraging multi-threading in the broker is part of future work, this must be carefully handled.

Additionally, one percent of the labels were set randomly to ensure some noise in the generated data. The SMO approach would be a better ﬁt for well separable data. However, real-world data is rarely free of noise and in the rarest cases also well and clearly separable. The more noisy and ambiguous the training data is, the better the LS-SVM is suited (for the theoretical background, see [28]). Therefore, the data for this analysis were selected with a little noise but still relatively well separable. This ensures that the data suits the SMO approach while representing the structure of real-world-like data. The number of data points and features for all synthetically generated data sets are power of twos.

2110.01989,data repos,,,"We report a new lensless microscopy configuration by integrating the concepts of transverse translational ptychography and defocus multi‐height phase retrieval. In this approach, we place a tilted image sensor under the specimen for linearly‐increasing phase modulation along one lateral direction. Similar to the operation of ptychography, we laterally translate the specimen and acquire the diffraction images for reconstruction. Since the axial distance between the specimen and the sensor varies at different lateral positions, laterally translating the specimen effectively introduces defocus multi‐height measurements while eliminating axial scanning. Lateral translation further introduces sub‐pixel shift for pixel super‐resolution imaging and naturally expands the field of view for rapid whole slide imaging. We show that the equivalent height variation can be precisely estimated from the lateral shift of the specimen, thereby addressing the challenge of precise axial positioning in conventional multi‐height phase retrieval. Using a sensor with 1.67‐µm pixel size, our low‐cost and field‐portable prototype can resolve 690‐nm linewidth on the resolution target. We show that a whole slide image of a blood smear with a 120‐ mm2 field of view can be acquired in 18 seconds. We also demonstrate accurate automatic white blood cell counting from the recovered image. The reported approach may provide a turnkey solution for addressing point‐of‐care‐ and telemedicine‐related challenges."

FUSION BASED APPROACHES Fusing different modalities mitigates the weaknesses of individual modalities both in 1D and 2D forms by integrating complementary information from the modalities to perform the analysis and classiﬁcation tasks accurately. In [45], a Multi-scale Fusion convolutional neural network (MS-CNN) is proposed for heartbeat classiﬁcation using ECG signal. The Multi-scale Fusion convolutional neural network is a two stream network consisting of 13 layers. The features obtained from the last convolutional layer are concatenated before classiﬁcation. Another Deep Multi-scale Fusion CNN (DMSFNet) is proposed in [46] for arrhythmia detection. Proposed model consists of backbone network and two different scale-speciﬁc networks. Features obtained from two scale speciﬁc networks are fused using a spatial attention module. Patient-speciﬁc heartbeat classiﬁcation network based on a customized CNN is proposed in [47]. CNN contains an important module called multi-receptive ﬁeld spatial feature extraction (MRF-SFE). The MRF-SFE module is designed for extracting multispatial deep features of the heartbeats using ﬁve parallel convolution layers with different receptive ﬁelds. These features are concatenated before being sent to the third convolutional layer for further processing. Two stage serial fusion classiﬁer system based on SVM’s rejection option is proposed in [48]. SVM’s distance outputs are related with conﬁdence measure and then ambiguous samples are rejected with ﬁrst level SVM classiﬁer. The rejected samples are then forwarded to a second stage Logistic Regression classiﬁer and then late fusion is performed for arrhythmia classiﬁcation. Authors in [49] presented a unique feature fusion method called parallel graphical feature fusion where all the focus is given to geometric features of data. Original signal was ﬁrst split into subspaces, then multidimensional features are extracted from these subspaces and then mapped to the points in high-dimensional space. Multi-stage feature fusion framework based on CNN and attention module was proposed in [50] for multiclass arrhythmia detection. Classiﬁcation is performed by extracting features from different layers of CNN. Combination of CNN"

We argue that potential harms of HARPO to online advertising ecosystem are lower than existing obfuscation approaches or other alternatives. HARPO does introduce additional costs/overheads for publishers and advertisers. Since HARPO reduces the effectiveness of user proﬁling and ad targeting, advertisers may have to spend more on advertising to achieve the same level of conversions. Publishers, in turn, may also notice a reduction in their advertising revenues. In the worst case where behavioral targeting is completely ineffective, advertisers may have to resort to contextual advertising that is reportedly about 52% less valuable [76], [77].

2101.00522,"data, dataset, data available",,,"SOTA semantic segmentation algorithms use deep neural network architectures to exploit large annotated datasets [40, 45, 37, 19]. These approaches are based on training a CNN encoder using manually annotated segmentation maps to learn a latent embedding of the data. An up-sampling decoder combined with a classiﬁer is then used to infer pixelwise estimations for the true semantic labels. Performance of such methods is high when large amounts of annotated data are available for supervised training. However, these methods are not suitable when the goal is to transfer knowledge between different domains [56, 46]. Model adaptation to target domains has been explored in both semisupervised and unsupervised settings. Semi-supervised approaches rely on the presence of a small number of annotated target data samples [44, 70]. For example, a weakly supervised signal on the target domain can be obtained using bounding boxes. However, manual data annotation of a small number of images is still a considerable bottleneck in the area of medical imaging because only trained professionals can perform this task.

2201.00732,data,,,"Extracting information from the observation of a natural system is a fundamental problem in science. Except in the few cases where laboratory or numerical experiments are performed, inferring physical parameters is never easy [1, 2]. Measurements are always limited and our theoretical knowledge sometimes is inadequate to extract from them a correct description of the system. A signiﬁcant example are turbulent ﬂows [3–6]. Here because of chaos, any error in the observations increases exponentially in time, and quickly compromises our possibility to understand, predict, hence model turbulent behaviour. Consequences of such limitations are clear in ﬁelds like meteorology, oceanography and climate modeling [7–12]. In this work we aim to analyse turbulent ﬂows in a diﬀerent way. In particular, we use tools of Machine Learning (ML) developed in the ﬁeld of computer vision such as Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) [13–16], to bring new perspectives in the data assimilation and analysis of complex physical systems [17– 24]. The setup we consider is 3d turbulence under rotation [25].

2201.10154,data,,,"emergence merely from data is still lack[9]. One of the diﬃculty is how to search all possible coarse-graining methods, on which the causal emergence can be found[9], in a systematic way. On a networked complex system, a coarse-graining strategy includes the way of grouping nodes and the method of mapping the micro-states within a group to a macro-state of the macro-level node[10]. The existing methods solve the problem by ﬁxing the mapping function of states, and searching all the grouping methods by heuristic optimization algorithms[5, 10]. However, there is no reason why some strategies of state coarse-graining are preferred but not others. Therefore, we should search on the space of all possible coarse-graining strategies such that the most informative causal mechanism on dynamics can be identiﬁed, however, the searching space is too large[9]. Another headache we must confront once we consider all possible coarse-graning strategies is that some trivial mapping between states of micro- and macro may be unavoidable. To show this, we consider a possible coarse-graining method is to map all the micro-states to an identical value as the macro-state. In this way, the macroscopic dynamics is only an identical mapping which will have large eﬀective information(EI) measure. However, it can not be called an informative causal emergence because all the information is eliminated by the coarse-graining method itself. Thus, we must ﬁnd a way to exclude such trivial strategies."

Notably, on Sleep-EDF, our methods achieve a mean kappa score of 0.83 as compared to 0.77 of a supervised network and 0.76 as reported in [7]. Likewise, our self-supervised technique performs better than the hand-designed features from wrist physiological signals on WESAD by achieving an F-score of 75.7 ± 0.13 as compared to 66.33 ± 0.36 [5]. Furthermore, we would like to highlight that a direct comparison of existing approaches on other datasets used in our study is not feasible due to the differences in reported metrics and used sensing modalities. Nevertheless, our results with cross-validation further indicate that self-supervised learning can be effectively utilized for sensor modeling tasks on a large scale and can be combined with active learning methods [54]."
2108.12966,data,,,"Unsupervised / Self-supervised Multi-view Stereo: The burgeoning ﬁeld of self-supervision [13] provide a competitive alternative for amazing performance and requiring no ground truth data. In Unsup MVS [21], the predicted depth map and the input images are utilized to reconstruct the image on another view by homography warping, thus the photometric consistency is enforced to minimize the difference between the original and reconstructed images. MVS2 [7] predicts the per-view depth maps simultaneously and automatically infer the occlusion relationship among views. M3VSNet [17] enforce the consistency between surface normal and depth map to regularize the MVS pipeline. JDACS [36] revisit the color constancy hypothesis of selfsupervision and propose a uniﬁed framework to enhance the robustness of self-supervision signal towards the natural color disturbance in multi-view images. Uncertainty: The uncertainty [8] in deep learning models for vision tasks can be classiﬁed as aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. Aleatoric uncertainty captures the noise inherent in the training data, while epistemic uncertainty provides interpretation for the uncertainty in the model which can be remedied with enough data. [20] study the beneﬁts of modeling epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in Bayesian deep learning models for vision tasks. In this work, we aim to reject the unreliable pixels estimated by the epistemic uncertainty. Similar idea also appears in [29]. Conﬁdence estimation is applied in MVS to ﬁlter the unreliable predictions, such as [23, 24]. UCS-Net [6] progressively reconstruct high-resolution depth map with a coarseto-ﬁne manner. The depth hypothesis of each stage adapts to the uncertainties of previous per-pixel depth predictions."

1908.09262,data,,,"We propose a novel GAN architecture called Reconstruction Global-Local GAN (Recon-GLGAN). The idea is inspired from a GAN based work [5] in the context of image inpainting. The idea behind Recon-GLGAN is to capture both the global and local contextual features. Recon-GLGAN consists of a generator and a context discriminator. The generator (G) tries to learn the mapping between data distribution of ZF image xu and FS image xf with the help of the context discriminator which can extract global and local features and classify it as real/fake. The context discriminator consists of three components: global feature extractor, local feature extractor and classiﬁer. The global feature extractor (ΨG) takes the entire image as input while the local feature extractor (ΨL) takes the region of interest (ROI) (Φ) from the entire image. The classiﬁer network (ΨC) takes the concatenated feature vector (ΨG(x)||ΨL(x)) to classify the input image as real/fake. The overview of the proposed architecture is shown in Figure 2. The joint optimization of the generator and context discriminator parameters is given by:"

This pool contains dialogues with at least one complex mention, a personal entity mention, or a clarification question in user utterances. By complex mention we refer to cases where the same mention is linked to different entities by the EL tools (i.e., REL, WAT, and TagMe). The clarification questions were identified based on the patterns stated in [8], and personal entity mentions were extracted as described in Section 4.2. A total of 100 samples were selected (25 for each dataset), amounting to 708 user utterances. Note that unlike the other datasets, CAsT contains only 25 dialogues, therefore all its dialogues were annotated. Based on this selection, we are able to analyze the differences between the three main categories of conversational tasks."

In this context, the research proposed in [14] clearly stated the data privacy problem of traditional AI-based solutions, but the evaluation took place on a private dataset. Also, the data was randomly split among clients, which can be improbable in realistic scenarios, as the one considered in this work, in which each client data comes from a diﬀerent distribution in general. The works presented in [10, 11] also have very similar objectives, but these researches were conducted speciﬁcally for industrial IoT devices, and they analyzed respectively application samples and sensor readings rather than network data, as we do in this work. In [12], FL was studied through the use case of intrusion detection systems. This work also includes blockchain technology to mitigate the problems faced in adversarial FL. However, it concentrates on the early steps of intrusion detection rather than detecting already running malware, and it does not focus speciﬁcally on IoT devices."

2203.0248,data repos,,,"not suﬃciently captured by the visual cue chosen (e.g., landmarks), the adequate inclusion of such features still has further room for improvement (Barquero et al., 2022). In fact, the inﬂuence of the scenario and the input representation on performance is also observed in works that focus on forecasting high-level representations. For instance, using head and body pose as input and output, each represented by a selected 3D landmark coordinate and a normal, Raman et al. (2021) observed that the addition of features from the other interlocutors harmed performance for the three predicted categories (including speaking status) when applied to an in-the-wild mingling scenario. In contrast, in a structured triadic scenario, head and body location were better predicted when adding such information (MSE of up to 15.84 cm vs. 18.20 cm), whereas orientation was better predicted without. When using input features other than landmarks, most works tend to beneﬁt from the addition of the partner’s features, even in conversational scenarios. For instance, Ishii et al. (2021) showed consistently superior performance when using speaker and listener features compared to using just one of them for backchannel (F1 score of 85.2% vs. up to 74.2%) and turn-changing (F1 score of 61.7% vs. up to 59.2%) prediction in a seated dyadic scenario. With respect to the methodological trends of low-level representation forecasting, we foresee a bright future for methods that use representations in the frequency space. Very recent works have reported promising results with such architectures, especially by helping to alleviate the very limiting freezing motion commonly observed in deterministic approaches. Related to the future perspective, we also expect future works to explore the stochastic point of view. Although many works from the single human behavior forecasting ﬁeld have already found beneﬁts from assuming the future stochasticity and thus predicting several futures, their translation to social settings remains unexplored. We think that the implementation of socially aware adversarial losses, like the dual-stream one presented by Airale et al. (2021) for behavioral action forecasting, could help to build systems capable of generating diverse, plausible, and socially coherent behavior. There are other research lines that have provided many beneﬁts in other ﬁelds that also remain uninvestigated. First, the exploration of multimodal approaches has been timidly addressed in the past only to generate immediate next motions (Hua et al., 2019; Ahuja et al., 2019), or in very preliminary and naive ways (Barquero et al., 2022). Future works should also test self-supervised learning techniques, which have shown their power in conceptually close applications like video prediction (Oprea et al., 2020), and could be similarly applied to this ﬁeld. Furthermore, models that update the learnt behavioral model according to each person’s individual behavioral patterns via meta-learning are also very promising (Moon and Seo, 2021)."

If we found multiple applicable candidate identifiers, we selected the one that seemed most suitable or best documented. For the cases where we could not find a matching identifier, we tried to find identifiers for parts of the required concept. These parts could then be used to construct a (partial) class definition, such as “obesity together with metabolic abnormality”, which can be defined as the intersection of the conditions “obesity” and “metabolic abnormality”. We mint new identifiers for such complex classes and also for the cases where we could not find any existing identifiers at all."

2108.02756,data,,,"The proposed Bidirectional One-Shot Synthesis (BOSS) solution differs from existing synthesis and adversarial machine learning methods in a number of key ways. First, is the capacity for BOSS to handle user-deﬁned constraints on both the input and output directions of the given pre-trained classiﬁer p(. ; θ), where the output constraint is not limited to only targeting a speciﬁc class. These constraints come in the form of distance bounds between the given datum xd (distribution pd) and the synthesized input datum x (output inference p(x ; θ)). The capacity to handle constraints in both the input and output directions of the model has the additional beneﬁt of producing speciﬁc outcomes. For example, a malicious attacker may want to cause a classiﬁer trained to detect stop signs to instead classify these as yield or speed limit signs with equal conﬁdence, which can lead to dire consequences in autonomous driving scenarios. Such inherent vulnerabilities in machine learning models are difﬁcult to test without accounting for both the input (e.g., the synthesized datum x must look like a stop sign) and output (e.g., p‘yield’(x ; θ) ≈ p‘speed 70’(x ; θ) ≈ 0.5) directions of the model simultaneously. See Figure 1 for examples. Second, our one-shot synthesis approach requires only a single datum, which mitigates the excessive data requirements of popular methods based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [4]. Finally, it is worth noting that the use of additive perturbations to data has been widely explored in the literature to induce misclassiﬁcations and test the robustness of learning models such as [3, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Though such approaches also often require only a single datum, they function by perturbing said datum to enact the attack. Our approach differs in that we synthesize a datum from scratch, thereby enabling the exploration and synthesis of data that exists outside the conﬁnes of typical perturbation bounds."

2104.13049,data,,,"recent advancements in satellite communication, vehicular technologies and IoT, intelligent transport system (ITS) has become an emerging research area during recent years. The conventional centralized system faces many issues like security, data storage, and server failure. The implementation of blockchain in the Internet of Vehicles(IoV) platform has been explored to support the information exchange necessity of ITS [11]. The application of blockchain in ITS provides immutabiltransparency, security, automation and decentralization ity, facilities. Decentralized IoV network of blockchain includes distributed entities such as vehicles, humans, and roadside nodes. These entities are allowed to operate autonomously. Blockchain helps IoV to remove the entities such as the central control, trusted intermediate parties, administrators, and central service manager. The blockchain network allows the participants to manage the transactions and vehicular services independently which results in reduced operational cost. Blockchain uses advanced cryptographic algorithms to provide security and privacy for IoV networks [8]. In the BEoT architecture, data alteration and tampering in IoV networks can be prevented by the immutability property of blockchain. AI-based connected autonomous vehicle framework trains the learning model in MEC systems and provides the obtained knowledge to the blockchain. This enables collective intelligence for connected vehicles and avoids large data transmission. Also, blockchain aids in securing the distributed trained models. Thus, connected vehicles have several advantages such as low latency response thereby increasing the network performance."

The presented auxiliary task can formally be seen as a binary classiﬁcation problem, and we employ a contrastive objective inspired by [30] for optimizing it (see Figure 2 for an overview) in both central and federated settings without involving a human in the data labeling process. Importantly, we would like to highlight that for the model to solve the deﬁned task successfully, it should learn the core semantics in shared input views through possibly relating frequency, scale, and other information present in the signal. The network captures meaningful latent relationships through correlating scalogram-signal inputs in the embedding space. Mainly, the representations that could emerge from the learning process are forms of invariances (such as sensor noise, subject-speciﬁc variations), which are essential tasks involving sensory data, e.g., stress detection with physiological signals. The key contributions of this work are three-fold: First, we propose a scalogram-signal correspondence learning framework for self-supervised learning from diverse sensory data. Second, to the best of our knowledge, we, for the ﬁrst time, propose to unify federated learning with self-supervision to learn from unlabeled and private data on edge devices. Third, we extensively assess the proposed method on several publicly available datasets from different domains with linear classiﬁcation protocol in central and federated contexts, lowdata regime (i.e., semi-supervised setting), and transfer learning including cross-validation. The SCN achieves competitive performance compared with fully-supervised networks that are trained entirely on labeled data and perform signiﬁcantly better than other approaches. Particularly, SCN ﬁne-tuning with fewlabeled instances, e.g., ﬁve or ten instances per class, improves the F-score by as much as 5%-6% in comparison to training from scratch. Our approach also works better than transferring supervised features, learned from the source data, between the related tasks."

Moreover, developers might select to locally host some of the known JS, where the local URLs would not match with the elements in the repository. Although the created dataset is limited to well-known JS libraries, it serves a large portion of JS in today’s web due to the following reasons: 1) it combines the features (not the URLs) of the elements with their associated categories. 2) The utilized features are associated with the JS access to web pages, which makes them appropriate for category prediction of previously unseen web-based JS."

(a) A common data processing pipeline, which is often implemented inside commercial MRI scanners, includes: k-space zero-padding, application of the inverse Fourier Transform, and coil combination via a Root Sum-of-Squares (RSS) step. The output image, which is interpolated and non-negative, is stored in a database. In subtle data crime I, this image is later used for synthesizing new k-space data; this yields artiﬁcial data in previously zero-padded areas. (b) A common data storage pipeline includes JPEG compression. In subtle data crime II, the compressed image is later used for retrospective experiments. (c) Standard research pipelines commonly involve retrospective subsampling of fully-sampled k-space data. In the subtle data crimes scenarios, the fully-sampled data are based on processed data, hence image reconstruction algorithms beneﬁt from the early data processing.

2203.0248,data,,,"or virtual agents (Huang et al., 2020; Murray et al., 2021). For example, these tests have been used to prove the great capacities of models that generate backchannel responses when it comes to successfully keeping the user engaged during human-robot interactions (Murray et al., 2021). For low-level representations though, there is still a lack of extensive studies that assess the transferability of the results to the target scenario. This is mainly due to the extra constraints posed by these low-level representations. In fact, some works highlight the current possibilities and limitations of behavior forecasting with such representations. For example, future behavior in competitive interactions like fencing strongly depends on the player’s decisions in answer to the competitor’s. Within this context, Honda et al. (2020) showed inferior performance for the rapid and highly stochastic motion of the dominant arm (PCKs of 71.8% and 66.4% for dominant hand and elbow, respectively) than for the other parts of the body (average PCK of 77.1%). This has been consistent in the literature for other less interactive scenarios like face-to-face conversations. Barquero et al. (2022) showed superior accuracy for behavior forecasting for face and upper body torso (errors of 12.70 and 5.75 pixels in average for a prediction of 2 seconds) than for hands (25.15 pixels). This represents an important bottleneck for hands forecasting, where research is almost nonexistent despite of their importance in human communication. The authors also showed superior performance (error of 5.34 pixels) than a naive but strong baseline (6.00 pixels) for the short term (<400ms). This opens new possibilities for providing humanrobot interactive agents with fairly accurate anticipation capabilities. For example, the proper activation of the actuators of a robot may beneﬁt from any extra milliseconds of In general though, we think that landmarks-based behavior forecasting is anticipation. still immature, and will strongly beneﬁt from further research eﬀorts. Another concerning issue related to this topic lies on the typology of the data leveraged for forecasting. Only models that make their predictions solely leveraging automatically retrieved data can be successfully applied to real life scenarios. Actually, and similarly to the low-level scenario, we expect the forecasting of high-level behavioral representations to greatly beneﬁt from the development of new accurate methods to automatically retrieve social cues/signals from raw image/audio data."

In the latter cases, the APs can serve each UE using a bandwidth of 100 GHz or higher, which yields extremely high data rates over short distances and low mobility. The spatial diversity gains of the cell-free architecture become particularly evident in such scenarios because the signal from a single AP is easily blocked, but the risk that all neighboring APs are simultaneously blocked is vastly lower.20"

The I-TAP method outperforms the I-Solution method since the set of paths that users can traverse is not restricted to the union of the routes under the UE and SO solutions as is the case for the I-Solution method. In particular, there may be traﬃc assignments with lower total travel times that use paths not encapsulated by the restricted set of paths corresponding to the I-Solution method. Furthermore, while the PoA for each of the data-sets is quite low, some real-world transportation networks may have much higher PoA values (even as high as two) [45], which would make the trade-oﬀ between eﬃciency and fairness even more prominent."

However, such fully-supervised learning algorithms require the training data and test data to be collected from the same distribution.

2007.12442,"open-source, data, data repos",,,"Abstract—The publish-subscribe paradigm is an efﬁcient communication scheme with strong decoupling between the nodes, that is especially ﬁt for large-scale deployments. It adapts natively to very dynamic settings and it is used in a diversity of real-world scenarios, including ﬁnance, smart cities, medical environments, or IoT sensors. Several of the mentioned application scenarios require increasingly stringent security guarantees due to the sensitive nature of the exchanged messages as well as the privacy demands of the clients/stakeholders/receivers. MQTT is a lightweight topic-based publish-subscribe protocol popular in edge and IoT settings, a de-facto standard widely adopted nowadays by the industry and researchers. However, MQTT brokers must process data in clear, hence exposing a large attack surface. This paper presents MQT-TZ, a secure MQTT broker leveraging ARM TRUSTZONE, a trusted execution environment (TEE) commonly found even on inexpensive devices largely available on the market (such as Raspberry Pi units). We deﬁne a mutual TLS-based handshake and a two-layer encryption for end-to-end security using the TEE as a trusted proxy. The experimental evaluation of our fully implemented prototype with micro-, macro-benchmarks, as well as with real-world industrial workloads from a MedTech use-case, highlights several tradeoffs using TRUSTZONE TEE. We report several lessons learned while building and evaluating our system. We release MQT-TZ as open-source."

Given a starting sentence, we instructed participants to “[w]rite a sentence that is the same in meaning as the given sentence but as structurally different as possible. Your sentence should be such that you can infer the given sentence from it AND vice-versa. It should be sufﬁciently different from the given sentence to get any reward for the submission. For example, a simple synonym substitution will most likely not work.” The sentences given to the participants came from MSRP and PPNMT (Section 1). Both of these datasets have pairs of sentences in each row, and we took only the ﬁrst one to present to the par ticipants. Neither of these datasets has duplicate sentences by design. Every time a sentence was selected, a random choice was made between MSRP and PPNMT, thus ensuring an even distribution of sentences from both datasets."

From Fig. 9 we can conclude that Bayesian inference based on the knowledge of likelihood on the mean energy allows only to classify among below and above transition values (top-right panel), while the same analysis repeated on the mean squared gradients likelihood, is not even enough to classify such transition. This can be explained by the fact that mean energy is a larger scale observable than the mean squared gradients, hence it is able to better highlight the formation of the large-scales vortexes. On the other hand, combining the two information at large and small scales the joint-likelihood Bayes estimate improve its prediction 15 at least it allows to quality and even if it does not allow to distinguish close Ω values such as in the range 5 always classify values below the transition Ω 15 and large rotation far from the transition Ω 20. The more detailed comparison is presented in Fig. 10, where in ten diﬀerent panels we report the PDF of the DCNN and Bayes predictions, for all Ω over all planes of validation set. Each PDF is normalized to corresponding rotation value such as Ωpred/Ωtrue = 1 indicates the correct prediction. The Bayes inference reported in this ﬁgure is based on the knowledge of the joint-likelihood P ( Ωi), which as already found gives a higher accuracy. The PDFs for the predictions in the direct cascade regime (Ω = 2&4) show diﬃculties for both approaches to distinguish the two cases. This is not surprising, indeed, before the transition no large-scale coherent structures are expected to appear in the ﬂow and the resulting ﬁeld should be almost equivalent for all rotation rates and similar to the non-rotating homogeneous and isotropic case. At the same time comparing the two PDFs before the transition we notice that while Bayes peaks always at the center between the two values, the DCNN is correctly peaked around one in both cases, suggesting that rotation is aﬀecting the ﬂow since before the inverse energy transfer is established in the dynamics. For all the other Ω after the transition, and in particular at intermediate rotation rate, the DCNN accuracy is always better than classical Bayesian approach. The ﬁnal comparison is presented in Fig.11 which contains a summary of what already shown by previous the PDFs. Here, indeed, it is shown the mean diﬀerence between the predicted and the true Ω value for all the diﬀerent classes considered.

2103.1163,dataset,,,"Due to the inherent limitations of top-k and skyline queries, Nanongkai et al. [3] proposed the k-regret minimization problem. The problem is NP-hard, and a greedy strategy is proposed. However, the developed approach suffers from efﬁciency issues, and cannot scale well for large datasets. The following studies attempt to solve the problem from different perspectives. Peng et al. [4] attempted to reduce the candidate points from the whole skyline points to a small candidate set by using geometric properties. Cao et al. [11] and Agarwal et al. [12] proposed the (cid:15)-kernel algorithm independently, which can keep the maximum regret ratio at most (cid:15) with an output size of O((cid:15)− d−1 2 ). However, the output sizes of these algorithms are uncontrollable. They made output size from 2 ) to k. Then the upper bound was O(k− 2 O((cid:15)− d−1 d−1 ) [6]. Agarwal et al. [12] also proposed the hitting-set algorithm, which returns O(k log k) points. Asudeh et al. [13] interpreted the k-regret query in a d-dimensional dataset as a discretized matrix min-max problem and proposed two algorithms with upper bounds. Moreover, Xie et al. [6] designed the state-ofthe-art Sphere algorithm whose upper bound on the maximum regret ratio was asymptotically optimal and restriction-free for datasets of any dimensionality. These bounds or theoretical results focus on the regret ratio instead of approximation guarantees. Qiu et al. [8] and Dong et al. [9] also provided the sampling techniques for 1-RMS and k-RMS queries, respectively. However, the proposed method in [8] is a special case of ours, where the sample factor equals 1, i.e., λ = 1. Additionally, they both do not provide any approximation guarantees."

Comparing with T-TTS, ours shows a signiﬁcant reduction in training time with miniature MOS deducted. Combining with the federated learning framework, we improve the model’s performance by collaborating with more data owners under absolute data privacy protection. The MOS of our model keeps increasing while adding clients, approaching the baseline method gradually. Besides, experiments on the LJSpeech datasets show that our FedDT-TTS surpasses FedT-TTS in time efﬁciency and model performance. On the one hand, the dynamic adding layers process signiﬁcantly saves client’s training time and communication costs. On the other hand, it contributes to improving global convergence robustly. Moreover, experiments on an unbalanced dataset and Mel-spectrograms analysis also prove that our DT-TTS is superior to Transformer-TTS in the federated learning framework."

Therefore, available textual data about the production can be overwhelming in terms of quantity. This affects the visibility and retrieval of a certain piece of information when it is most needed. In this paper, we propose a dynamic approach to interlink the information extracted from multisource production-relevant documents through the creation of a knowledge graph. This graph is constructed in order to support searchability and enhance user’s access to large-scale production information. Text mining methods are firstly utilized to extract data from multiple documentation sources. Document relations are then mined and extracted for the composition of the knowledge graph. Graph search functionality is then supported with a recommendation use-case to enhance users’ access to information that is related to the initial documents. The proposed approach is tailored to and tested on microchip design-relevant documents. It enhances the visibility and findability of previous design-failure-cases during the process of a new chip design."

Hence, paired face SR networks often rely on face-speciﬁc prior information to subdue the artifacts and make the network focus on important features. Networks like [12], [5], [44], [42] rely on facial landmarks and heatmaps to impose additional constraints on the output whereas [14] leverage HR exemplars to produce high-quality HR outputs. On the other hand, networks like [20], [11] rely on pairs of LR and HR face images to perceptually super-resolve faces. Even though the above methods are somewhat robust to noise and occlusion, they are not equipped well enough to handle noises and blur which are as complex and as diverse as those in real images. [31] come close by attempting the problem of unsupervised class-speciﬁc deblurring but the blur under consideration was uniform and it still leaves the problem of denoising and super-resolution unaddressed. [43], [40] leverage capsule networks and transformative autoencoders to class-speciﬁcally super-resolve noisy faces but the noises are synthetic. As of yet, there seems to be no dataset with paired examples of degraded LR and clean HR images of faces available. As a result, in recent years, there has been a shift in face SISR methods from paired to unpaired. Recently, with the release of Widerface [41] dataset of real low-resolution faces and the wide availability of high resolution face recognition datasets such AFLW [30], VGGFace2 [9] and CelebAMask-HQ [26], Bulat et al. [6] propose a training strategy where a High-to-Low GAN is trained to convert instances from clean HR face images to corresponding degraded LR images and a Low-to-High GAN is then trained using synthetically degraded LR images and their clean HR counterparts. This method is highly eﬀective since it does not require facial landmarks or heatmaps for faces (as they are not available for real face images captured in the wild)."

Parameter Server (PS) [11] is a well-known architecture adopted early in TensorFlow [64] where all workers communicate with the central parameter server(s). It easily suffers from communication bottlenecks. If every worker sends a message of size M to the central server and the network interface is saturated by every message, the total communication in PS is n( M B + L). Like PS, the Ring-Allreduce [12] architecture organizes all nodes on a ring and divides each local gradient tensor into n chunks for parallel communication. Ring-Allreduce achieves a remarkable communication time of 2M B + 2nL. The bandwidth-bound time 2M B is optimal [65], where constant 2 is not improvable (without hardware additions). Ring-Allreduce has been implemented in Horovod and Pytorch. Fig. 1 illustrates the Parameter Server and Ring-Allreduce operations. Another framework BytePS [36] is based on PS-lite [66] and can reduce the bandwidth cost from 2M B to M B using n additional CPU servers. Instead of passing each of the n chunks over a ring, each worker pushes its ith chunk to server i and pulls the accumulated chunk back, achieving a total communication time of M B + nL. The communication overheads of Parameter Server, Ring-Allreduce, and BytePS are listed in Table I. Libraries that support partial averaging. The open-source codes or libraries to provide the system-level partial averaging are limited. The codes brought along with [3], [67] implemented only the decentralized algorithms proposed therein.

With the system-level neighbor-allreduce, neighbor-allgather, and the topologyoriented APIs provided by BlueFog, we can easily schedule the time-varying ﬁsh topology, recognize the dynamic neighborhood, and conduct local information exchange between neighboring ﬁshes. Note that the topology of ﬁsh schools is highly dynamic especially when ﬁshes are escaping or encircling, this simulation will test how robust BlueFog is to dynamic topology scheduling. Problem formulation. Consider n ﬁshes distributed over some spatial region. Two ﬁshes are said to be neighbors if they are within a predeﬁned distance. The objective of the ﬁsh school is to estimate the predator’s location in a fully decentralized manner and take actions such as disperse or encircle. The estimation of the predator’s location can be formulated into a distributed optimization problem. For ﬁsh i at time k, it will have a local estimate of the distance d(k) between the predator and itself. If we denote the direction vector as u(k) sin θ(k) , and the i predator’s position w(cid:63) can be characterized as d(k) i − w(cid:63)) + n(k) denotes additive noise. If we let fi(w) = 1 i (xi − w)]2 to be the local loss function of ﬁsh i to estimate the predator’s position w(cid:63), the global loss function of the ﬁsh schools to estimate the predator’s position can be formulated as w(cid:63) = arg minw{(cid:80)n i=1 fi(w)}, which is a distributed optimization problem and can be solved with decentralized stochastic gradient descent (4) and (5). When w(k+1) is estimated at time k, each ﬁsh will either escape from the predator or encircle it at time k + 1. The detail to formulate these ﬁsh behaviors can be referred to [75]. Code. The simulation of ﬁsh schools with BlueFog is to illustrate how to use partial averaging over time-varying graphs. The code snippet is shown in Listing 2. Note the neighborhood at each iteration is determined by the argument src weights, which is a dictionary mapping the rank to the scaling weights. The argument src weights is updated at each iteration through the neighbor location collections function and Metropolis-Hastings Rule."

For data augmentation, we use three initial augmentations (i.e., horizontal ﬂip, color change (color jitter and grayscale), Inception crop (Szegedy et al. 2015)), which are commonly used in contrastive learning to build a single model. We additionally use rotation for OOD data in training. To evaluate the contribution of each augmentation when task models are trained sequentially, we train CLOM using one augmentation. We do not report their effects on forgetting as we experience rarely any forgetting (Fig. 2 and Tab. 3). Tab. 4 shows that the performance is lower when only a single augmentation is applied. When all augmentations are applied, the TIL/CIL accuracies are higher. The rotation always improves the result when it is combined with other augmentations. More importantly, when we use crop and rotation, we achieve higher CIL accuracy (79.4/60.3% for CIFAR10-5T/CIFAR100-10T) than we use all augmentations without rotation (74.0/50.2%).

To validate this, we show the statistics of Params, i.e., the number of network parameters, and FLOPs, i.e., the speed of training, in Table 2. It is clearly shown that SR introduced very little computational overheads for both SS tasks. For example in WSSS, applying MEA, SR-L and SR-F losses increased 1.1M, 0.0M, and 0.2M Params, respectively. Using MEA increased only 0.3B FLOPs, and using SR-L and SR-F for 0.

By conducting unit ablation experiments on CNNs trained on large scale image datasets, we demonstrate that, though ablating any individual unit does not hurt overall classiﬁcation accuracy, it does lead to signiﬁcant damage on the accuracy of speciﬁc classes. This result shows that an individual unit is specialized to encode information relevant to a subset of classes. We compute the correlation between the accuracy drop under unit ablation and various attributes of an individual unit such as class selectivity and weight L1 norm. We conﬁrm that unit attributes such as class selectivity are a poor predictor for impact on overall accuracy as found previously in recent work [11]. However, our results show that class selectivity along with other attributes are good predictors of the importance of one unit to individual classes. We evaluate the impact of random rotation, batch normalization, and dropout to the importance of units to speciﬁc classes.

One of the reasons for this is that most of the existing literature dealt with bounded and Lipschitz loss functions [1], [6], [18], which is typical for classiﬁcation problem, but not for regression problems. In [7] PAC-Bayesian bounds for linear regression with a quadratic loss function was developed, later this bound was improved and extended to non i.i.d. data in [17]. In particular, in [17] the derived PAC-Bayesian error bound for non i.i.d linear regression problem was applied to learning ARX models. Note that in [17] control inputs were allowed, while in the current paper we consider only autonomous systems. Since ARX models without inputs correspond to AR models, and the latter class represents a special case of autonomous stochastic LTI state-space representations, the present paper can be viewed as an extension of [17] to stochastic LTI statespace representations."

Nevertheless, due to their abundance, they are often downloaded and used for synthesizing ""raw"" k-space data using the forward Fourier transform; the synthesized data are then used for the development of reconstruction algorithms. We identiﬁed that this common approach can lead to undesirable consequences; the underlying cause is that the non-raw MR images are commonly processed using hidden pipelines. These pipelines, which are implemented by commercial scanner software or during database storage, include a full set or a subset of the following steps: image reconstruction, ﬁltering, storage of magnitude data only (i.e. loss of the MRI complex values), lossy compression, and conversion to DICOM or NIFTI formats; these reduce the data entropy. We aim to highlight that when modern algorithms are trained and evaluated using such data, they beneﬁt from the data processing and hence tend to exhibit overly-optimistic results as compared to performance on raw, unprocessed data. Since this phenomenon is largely unknown, such biased results are sometimes published as state-of-the-art, without reporting the data processing pipelines or addressing their effects. In order to raise community awareness to this growing problem, we coin the term subtle data crimes to describe such publications, in reference to the more obvious inverse crime scenario [30] which is described next."

This transition prior has strong connections with slow feature analysis (Sprekeler et al., 2014; Klindt et al., 2020) which measures slowness in terms of the L2 distance between temporally adjacent encodings as temporal constraints for nonlinear ICA. Note that although the Laplacian-like distributional form is pre-deﬁned, the generalized Laplacian distrbution can still be used to ﬁt a broad family of perturbations with different shapes by changing α and λ of the distribution."
2203.0945,data,,,"Given a batch of N samples, each sample x is ﬁrst duplicated and each version then goes through three initial augmentations (also see Data Augmentation in Sec. 4) to generate two different views x1 and x2 (they keep the same class label as x). Denote the augmented batch by B, which now has 2N samples. In (Hendrycks et al. 2019; Tack et al. 2020), it was shown that using image rotations is effective in learning OOD detection models because such rotations can effectively serve as out-of-distribution (OOD) training data. For each augmented sample x ∈ B with class y of a task, we rotate x by 90◦, 180◦, 270◦ to create three images, which are assigned three new classes y1, y2, and y3, respectively. This results in a larger augmented batch ˜B. Since we generate three new images from each x, the size of ˜B is 8N . For each original class, we now have 4 classes. For a sample x ∈ ˜B, let ˜B(x) = ˜B\{x} and let P (x) ⊂ ˜B\{x} be a set consisting of the data of the same class as x distinct from x. The contrastive representation of a sample x is zx = g(h(x, t))/(cid:107)g(h(x, t))(cid:107), where t is the current task. In learning, we minimize the supervised contrastive loss (Khosla et al. 2020) of task t."

With time, accessing especially the accumulated textual data becomes a long and rather inefficient search procedure, if it is approached through traditional searching methods, such as a key-word-based search. In this context, searching the available data is a mean of enhancing its visibility, aligned to the content of the respective search. However, it is not the only method of accessing data. Data visibility, to the users, can be handled through searching, hints or recommendations, among other methods. Depending on the context, one or more methods can be utilized to enable not only accessing textual data, but also extracting the specific intention of documents, such as previous experiences in the production process, in the form of lessons-learned documents from the past. For example, failures in previous production processes are usually documented along the production line. However, it is not likely that a new worker will search for all possible failures that can take place when adjusting a certain parameter in a machine. In this case, a system that automatically highlights a previous failure case, which is related to this particular parameter or this machine, has the potential to save time or prevent possible damage.  In this paper, we handle this challenge in a limited environment, which is the microchip design process. In the design phase of a new semiconductor product, the ability of the design engineer to have an overview on the database of previous design failure cases and tailored lessons learned, enables an improvement in the design process. It leads to time and material savings and quality enhancements, e.g. for the choice of combinations of electronic elements for the chip. This, in turn, is reflected as an overall quality improvement, not only of the product, but also of the design procedure itself.  Therefore, our proposed system is meant to support the design process through enhancing the visibility of designrelated textual data from manufacturing-relevant datasets. It allows the design engineer to search for specific failure cases and provides automatic highlights of the previous failures that are related to the current design, which the engineer is working on. As shown in [2], especially in the field of semiconductor manufacturing, tailored instead of off-the-shelf solutions are continuously needed to enable smart solutions, despite growing amounts of relevant, tracked data.

While blockchain ensures privacy-preserving data transaction, it is prone to various security threats such as crypto key exchange, data leakage, regulatory needs, double spending of currency, linking transactions and handling data in the chain. The immutability of blockchains in the BEoT paradigm may open a loophole for third-party service providers to loot the data leading to various cyber-attacks. Also, existing security services such as information coding and digital signatures, impose a higher computational overhead. Further, those services shall introduce additional overhead in mining nodes which perform both mining and authorization. The smart contracts or the chain code are written using different languages and are vulnerable to many security risks such as different interpretations for programming constructs and concurrency issues. Therefore, appropriate validation and veriﬁcation must be carried for smart contracts to avoid vulnerable security risks. The open research challenges include privacy-preserving data transactions with lower computational overhead, the privacy of chain code, authorized third-party services, and segregating activities from the mining node to reduce the overhead. Above all, the new enforced techniques should be well-suited with the scalable nature of the BEoT paradigm."

The process of training a GAN requires a large amount of training data. Here, the underlying task, and the training process and its requirements are altogether different: given a trained model, we seek to generate an example that induces a predeﬁned Probability Mass Function (PMF) at its output and to simultaneously enforce similarity to a desired example, without access to any training dataset. This is accomplished in our implementation without the use of a discriminator.

Besides, it has been demonstrated that the privacy of the data can be preserved without losing model performance by following the federated approach. The resilience of the federated models against malicious clients has been tested through the following adversarial attacks: i) a data poisoning attack ﬂipping all labels, ii) a model poisoning attack multiplying gradients by a negative factor, and iii) a model cancelling attack. The results showed that without using a robust technique to aggregate the models, a single malicious client in the federation can ruin the model.

2011.10298,dataset,,,"Finally, we test H-SGD also on a classiﬁcation benchmark with a logistic regression task. In particular, we use a 2-dimensional binary moon-shaped dataset (Chapelle et al., 2006) with 1000 samples corrupted by Gaussian noise. As the dataset is clearly not linearly separable, we opt for a cubic model, which, used in combination with the logistic regression framework, leads to a non-convex objective function where the optimization variable w is the collection of the model’s coefﬁcients. For both H-SGD and SGD we use a mini-batch size of 20 and tune the value of the step-size on the SGD’s performance for that mini-batch size. Regarding H-SGD, we use as source task the one obtained considering a linear instead of a cubic model, which results in a convex and hence “easy” optimization problem. We then gradually increase the non-linearity of the model, i.e. non-convexity of the problem, until reaching in the ﬁnal homotopy iteration the target problem with the desired cubic model. This homotopy map is obtained by multiplying the coefﬁcients of the non-linear terms in the model by λ as follows j,2 + c3 x2 j,1 + c2 x3 λ(c1 x3 j,2) + c7 xj,1 + c8 xj,2 + c9 . (17) For the homotopy parameter we adopt the increasing schedule that is suggested in Theorem 3.11. H-SGD outperforms SGD by reaching an error of 0.1 more than two times faster than SGD (see Figure 11 in the Appendix)."
2010.0562,data,,,"Canonical correlation models have been widely used in biology [8], neuroscience [9], medicine [10], and engineering [11], for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning. By extracting meaningful dimensionality reduced representations, CCA improves downstream tasks such as clustering, classiﬁcation, or manifold learning. One key limitation of these models is that they typically require more samples than features, i.e., N > Dx, Dy. However, if we have more variables than samples, the estimation based on the closed-form solution of the CCA problem (in Eq. 1) breaks [12]. Moreover, in high dimensional data, often some of the variables do not measure the phenomenon that is common to both modalities (therefore are not correlated) and thus should be omitted from the transformations. For these reasons, there has been a growing interest in studying sparse CCA models."

This reveals a change in the syntactic structure of the generated question while the semantic relatedness between the ground truth remains unchanged or even improved. This second fact corroborates the aforesaid hypothesis stating that the model’s parameters are optimized toward enhancing the performance regarding the metric used in the discriminator component. This observation can be justiﬁed by the fact that the values of the hyper-parameters, namely α, γ convey that the embedding cosine similarity of the representation outputs by the discriminator has a high contribution to the reward score and the reinforcement learning loss component has a high contribution to the overall loss. Both architectures developed outperforms the vanilla architecture of the T5 base, this authenticates the usefulness of the generator-evaluator architecture set to address the question generation. In terms of BLEU score. The exploration of the large architectures of T5 was not carried out in this work. But instead, the potential of relatively small architecture to perform on par with the larger ones leading the leaderboard. In addition to automatic evaluation, a binary human-based evaluation of the semantic correlation between the ground truth and the prediction was carried out. 500 questions were randomly sampled from the initial dataset (SQuAD v1.1) and the model used was the T5base + RLbase(BLEU + Semantic) conﬁguration. The generated questions were classiﬁed in different WH-question classes, then for each class, the proportion of questions positively ranked by 5 crowdworkers was calculated. Based on the results in table 3, it is noted that the model hardly generates questions related to explanation whilst it has an affordable performance when the questions are related to time and date. The aim of this human evaluation step is to track the type of questions where the model has a good/bad performance to design a speciﬁc discriminator for each type of question in further work."

This work aims to highlight that in some cases, this common practice may lead to biased, overlyoptimistic results. We demonstrate this phenomenon for inverse problem solvers and show how their biased performance stems from hidden data processing pipelines. We describe two data processing pipelines typical of open-access databases and study their effects on three well-established algorithms developed for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction: Compressed Sensing (CS), Dictionary Learning (DictL), and DL. In this large-scale study we performed extensive computations. Our results demonstrate that the CS, DictL and DL algorithms yield systematically biased results when naively trained on seemingly-appropriate data: the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) improves consistently with the data processing extent, showing an artiﬁcial increase of 25%-48% in some cases. Since this phenomenon is generally unknown, biased results are sometimes published as state-of-the-art; we refer to that as subtle data crimes. This work hence raises a red ﬂag regarding naive off-label usage of Big Data and reveals the vulnerability of modern inverse problem solvers to the resulting bias."

In this paper, we study entity linking for conversational systems. To develop a better understanding of what EL in a conversational setting entails, we analyze a large number of dialogues from existing conversational datasets and annotate references to concepts, named entities, and personal entities using crowdsourcing. Based on the annotated dialogues, we identify the main characteristics of conversational entity linking. Further, we report on the performance of traditional EL systems on our Conversational Entity Linking dataset, ConEL, and present an extension to these methods to better fit the conversational setting. The resources released with this paper include annotated datasets, detailed descriptions of crowdsourcing setups, as well as the annotations produced by various EL systems.

2103.1163,"data, dataset",,,"Even though the PRESGREED algorithm can efﬁciently compute the result with theoretical guarantees, it is still not scalable when n is large. To scale for large datasets, a common method uses a sampling-based technique to reduce the number of data points evaluated [21] and returns a result with tight theoretical guarantees. Therefore, we propose a sampling-based method, STOCPRESGREED, which extends the proposed PRESGREED algorithm. The algorithm details are shown in Algorithm 2, which replaces lines 3-4 in Algorithm 1 with lines 1-3. The difference between STOCPRESGREED and PRESGREED is that PRESGREED ﬁnds a point from D\Si−1 directly, while STOCPRESGREED samples a subset R randomly and then ﬁnds the point in R which contributes the most to the value of the happiness ratio. To bound the quality of returned results for a sampling-based approach, a critical issue is to carefully choose the sample size. To do this, in each iteration of the algorithm, we sample a set R of size s = n λ−1+(cid:15) ) uniformly at random, where (cid:15) > 0 and λ ≥ 1, which is the sample factor."

Current machine learning techniques either depend on manually extracted features or large and complex deep learning networks which merely utilize the 1D ECG signal directly. Since intelligent multimodal fusion can perform at the stateof-the-art level with an efﬁcient deep network, therefore, in this paper, we propose two computationally efﬁcient multimodal fusion frameworks for ECG heart beat classiﬁcation called Multimodal Image Fusion (MIF) and Multimodal Feature Fusion (MFF). At the input of these frameworks, we convert the raw ECG data into three different images using Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Recurrence Plot (RP) and Markov Transition Field (MTF). In MIF, we ﬁrst perform image fusion by combining three imaging modalities to create a single image modality which serves as input to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In MFF, we extracted features from penultimate layer of CNNs and fused them to get unique and interdependent information necessary for better performance of classiﬁer. These informational features are ﬁnally used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classiﬁer for ECG heart-beat classiﬁcation. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed fusion models by performing experiments on PhysioNet’s MIT-BIH dataset for ﬁve distinct conditions of arrhythmias which are consistent with the AAMI EC57 protocols and on PTB diagnostics dataset for Myocardial Infarction (MI) classiﬁcation.

2011.02427,dataset,,,"Abstract. Real low-resolution (LR) face images contain degradations which are too varied and complex to be captured by known downsampling kernels and signal-independent noises. So, in order to successfully super-resolve real faces, a method needs to be robust to a wide range of noise, blur, compression artifacts etc. Some of the recent works attempt to model these degradations from a dataset of real images using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). They generate synthetically degraded LR images and use them with corresponding real high-resolution(HR) image to train a super-resolution (SR) network using a combination of a pixel-wise loss and an adversarial loss. In this paper, we propose a two module super-resolution network where the feature extractor module extracts robust features from the LR image, and the SR module generates an HR estimate using only these robust features. We train a degradation GAN to convert bicubically downsampled clean images to real degraded images, and interpolate between the obtained degraded LR image and its clean LR counterpart. This interpolated LR image is then used along with it’s corresponding HR counterpart to train the super-resolution network from end to end. Entropy Regularized Wasserstein Divergence is used to force the encoded features learnt from the clean and degraded images to closely resemble those extracted from the interpolated image to ensure robustness."

2101.00522,data,,,"UDA approaches have explored two main strategies to reduce the domain gap. A large number of works rely on generative adversarial networks (GANs) [72, 27]. The core idea is to train a GAN such that data points of both domains can be mapped into a domain-agnostic embedding space [23]. To this end, a cross-domain discriminator network is trained to classify whether an input data point belongs to the source domain or the target domain. The discriminator network receives its input from a feature generator network. The discriminator network is fooled by the feature generator network which is trained as an adversary to generate domain-agnostic features at its output. As a result, a classiﬁer network that is trained using the source domain annotated data at the output of the generator network would generalize well in the target domain [41, 14]. An area of weakness for GANs is mode collapse which happens and need for ﬁne-tuning the model hyper-parameters."

The results show that if the causal connection in the data is strong, then as we train the neural networks, the macro-dynamics will increase its informativeness. And during this process, the determinant of the Jacobian of the bijector and the entropy of the macro-state will increase in the same time. We also found a mathematical expression for the eﬀective information of the macro-dynamics without the explicit dependence on the macro-dynamics, and it is determined solely by the bijector and the data when the whole framework is well trained. Furthermore, if the framework has been trained in a suﬃcient time, the mutual information of the macro-dynamics will keep a constant no matter the scale q is. However, as q decreases, the mutual information or the bandwidth on the encoder part also decreases and closed to the information limitation on the entire channel such that it can make correct prediction for the future micro-states. Thus, the task becomes harder for the encoder because more eﬀective information must be encoded and pass to the dynamics learner such that it can make correct prediction with less information. Numerical experiments show that our framework can reconstruct the dynamics in diﬀerent scales and also can discover emergent causality in data on several classic causal emergence examples."

The objective of the research is to improve the microchip design quality, through increasing document visibility and findability for design engineers, based on the constructed graph. Multisource, multimodal, data sets have been utilized in the definition of document models and the extraction of interrelations amongst them. An extended text mining algorithm was utilized and tailored to define and construct the different types of extraction-based nodes in the knowledge graph. Nodes and relations were built upon the information extracted from multiple data types. An approach to enhance the graph’s construction and inter-linking has been proposed and tested in order to highlight the increased visibility of relevant queried design documentations to the user, through a search and recommendation scenario. Results of this approach show that the introduction of linking nodes positively influenced the document visibility and access by up to 43%.  The presented approach is specifically tailored to the individual types of documents present in the given use-case, which are utilized in a way to maximize the extraction and interlinking of relevant information, e.g. through further exploit their explicit, known structure. However, the exploited structural and contextual information is equally present in other failure, best-practice and design related documentations of products in other domains of manufacturing and can thus be applied and tailored to more domains as a novel integrated approach of knowledge graph generation and utilization.

We use two low-end mobile devices: a HUAWEI Y511-U30 (which costs about $89, and is equipped with a dual-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7 CPU and 512 MB RAM) and a Xiaomi Remdi Go (which costs about $70, and is equipped with a quad-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A53 CPU and 1 GB RAM). The Xiaomi phone connects to the Internet over a fast WiFi where network throttling was used to emulate both 3G (downlink/uplink set to 1.6 Mbps/768 Kbps, RTT set to 150ms) and 4G (downlink/uplink set to 12 Mbps, RTT set to 70ms) networks, whereas the HUAWEI phone connects to the Internet using real 3G/4G networks. The two phones are located in two different labs, whose locations were anonymized to respect the double-blind review policy. Each mobile device connects via USB to a Linux machine which is used to run browser automation tools: Browsertime [51] with the Firefox browser and Lighthouse [11] with both Chrome and Brave. Such browser automation tools are used to automate both web page loads and telemetry collection, e.g. performance metrics and network requests. Our testbed further consists of a second Linux machine which acts as SlimWeb’s server and runs the JS labeling service (see Figure 1). This machine was located in the same lab as the Xiaomi Remdi Go and about 100 ms ⇠ (median latency) away from the HUAWEI Y511-U30."

If G(cid:48) is a non-leaf node, the query is handled as follows: First, data structures OG(cid:48),S1(G(cid:48)) and OG(cid:48),S2(G(cid:48)) are queried with u and λ, resulting in two “candidate sets”, C1 and C2, one for each query.

Compute dG(cid:48) = min {dG(u, c) | c ∈ C1 ∪ C2} ∪ {∞} by querying D once for each vertex of C1 ∪ C2. The query then recursively resolves dG(cid:48)(cid:48) = dG(cid:48)(cid:48) (u, λ) where G(cid:48)(cid:48) is a child of G(cid:48) in T containing u.

First, the client-broker link is protected by TLS within mosquitto. Second, MQTT’s payload is encrypted using the clients’ symmetric key. Then, data is re-encrypted in the TEE (as detailed next) and sent to its destination over a mosquitto-TLS channel. Doing so, we achieve end-toend security relying on TRUSTZONE as a secure proxy. We also leverage Access Control Lists to limit the clients able to interact with the broker. These are currently stored in the REE, but if clients are deﬁned in advance, its contents could be measured during boot and stored also in SS, preventing an attacker from tampering with the lists.

2201.00732,"data, dataset",,,"Each of these limitation strongly compromises our knowledge of the systems, however, as discussed above the ﬁrst one is the most stringent. Indeed, up to our knowledge, there are not previous attempts based on Machine Learning techniques to attack the problem without any knowledge on the equations of motion. For comparison, in this work, we have repeated the same investigation using standard Bayesian Inference (BI) analysis. Results highlight the superiority of DCNN in solving regression problems and show how DCNN can be used to improve current data analysis capability. At the same time, in this work we tested DCNN on a much more challenging task than the standard image classiﬁcation performed to simulate human vision [38–45]. We have also attempted to perform the same classiﬁcation, using the unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) classiﬁcation [46–48]. However we did not ﬁnd any relation between the unsupervised classiﬁcation and the rotation value, so it has not been included in the comparison with DCNN and BI. The paper is organized as follow. In Sect. II there is a detailed description of the datasets used in this work. In Sect. III we describe all methodologies, namely the DCNN and the BI. Results are presented in Sect. IV, and in Sect. V we draw our concluding remarks."

2007.13018,"code, data",,,"Previous approaches to learning representations from timeseries of sensory modalities with deep networks can be mainly categorized into three areas: end-to-end training of supervised models with labeled data [4], [6], [7], [10], reconstruction of the actual input for pre-training [11]–[13], and utilizing self-learning with domain-speciﬁc transformations or crossmodal learning [14]. Primarily, the focus of these methods is to conduct training of predictive models on a central server in a data center. However, as mentioned earlier, the aggregation of continuously increasing data from distributed devices is practically infeasible, aside from privacy issues. Initially, geodistributed analytics [15], [16] and distributed learning [17]– [19] in a data center environment is studied to exploit data locality and reducing network costs through pushing code to the data on the edge which generally is a node in the data center which could be across the globe. Nevertheless, these methods do not address the fundamental problem of learning representations with deep networks from unlabeled and highly distributed data that resides on user devices, which can not be aggregated in a central environment for learning."

2202.12674,data,,,"The differences become larger if we ﬁx the number of data points to 215 and vary the number of features from 26 to 214. This time, PLSSVM has a slightly ﬂatter slope than ThunderSVM. ThunderSVM needs 241 s for training a data set with 211 features. Using PLSSVM this can be reduced by a factor of 14.2 to only 17 s. This additionally indicates that our implementation scales better with the number of features compared to ThunderSVM. Increasing the number of features by a factor of four from 211 to 213 using PLSSVM, increases the runtime by a factor of roughly 5.5. Actually, we had expected that the factor would be larger, since a four-fold increase of the number of features means an eight-fold increase of the matrix entries. However, in the selected scenario, the complexity of the problem to learn remains the same. It can thus be stated that, despite more features, fewer CG iterations are needed to solve the system of linear equations to a similar accuracy. Note that the observed performance advantage of PLSSVM over ThunderSVM thus depends to some extent on the actual classiﬁcation problem."

Nearest neighbor approximations of mutual information in a sample population are less susceptible to variance due to parameterization than traditional binning methods; e.g. adjusting the neighbor N count for each point x does not inﬂuence the variance in mutual information as signiﬁcantly as adjusting the bandwidth of a Gaussian kernel[Ross, 2014]."

By placing a tilted image sensor under the specimen, we introduce linearly increasing phase modulation along one lateral direction. Laterally translating the specimen in our platform, therefore, effectively introduce defocus multi-height measurements while eliminating axial scanning. We show that the equivalent height variation can be precisely estimated from the lateral shift of the specimen, thereby addressing the challenge of precise axial positioning in conventional multi-height phase retrieval. We also show that a whole slide image of a blood smear with a 120-mm2 field of view can be acquired in 18 seconds. One future direction is to integrate multi-angle illumination in Fourier ptychography for synthetic aperture imaging and diffraction tomographic imaging."

DomainNet is initially a multi-source domain adaptation benchmark. Similar to MME [46], we only select 4 domains Real, Clipart, Painting, and Sketch (abbr. R, C, P, and S), each of which contains images of 126 categories. Ofﬁce-Home is a widely used UDA benchmark and consists of Real, Clipart, Art, and Product (abbr. R, C, A, and P) domains with 65 classes. For fair comparison, the settings of our benchmark datasets refer to the existing SSDA approaches [46, 44, 28], including adaptation scenarios of each dataset, the number of labeled target data (typically 1-shot or 3-shot per class), sample selection strategies, etc. In particular, we choose MME [46] as our baseline and report the results on both ResNet34 [21] and AlexNet [30]. Experimental Details. Following MME [46], we remove the last linear layer of AlexNet and ResNet34, while adding a new classiﬁer F . We also use the model pre-trained on ImageNet to initialize all layers except F . We adopt SGD with a momentum of 0.9 and set the initial learning rate is 0.01 for fully-connected layers whereas it is set 0.001 for other layers. The max iteration number is set to 50k. For the hyper-parameters in PCL, we set s = 7 in all experiments. We set λ = 0.1 under the setting of 3-shot for AlexNet and set λ = 0.2 under the setting of 3-shot for ResNet34 in DomainNet. For all other experiments, we set λ = 0.05. Comparison with SOTA.

However, many paraphrase datasets currently in widespread use rely on a sense of paraphrase based on word overlap and syntax. Can we teach them instead to identify paraphrases in a way that draws on the inferential properties of the sentences, and is not over-reliant on lexical and syntactic similarities of a sentence pair? We apply the adversarial paradigm to this question, and introduce a new adversarial method of dataset creation for paraphrase identiﬁcation: the Adversarial Paraphrasing Task (APT), which asks participants to generate semantically equivalent (in the sense of mutually implicative) but lexically and syntactically disparate paraphrases. These sentence pairs can then be used both to test paraphrase identiﬁcation models (which get barely random accuracy) and then improve their performance. To accelerate dataset generation, we explore automation of APT using T5, and show that the resulting dataset also improves accuracy. We discuss implications for paraphrase detection and release our dataset in the hope of making paraphrase detection models better able to detect sentence-level meaning equivalence."

2110.15667,data,,,"The key difference between our method and existing QCNNs is that the dilated convolution is employed for the quantum convolutional layer. So the quantum layer in QDCNNs is called quantum dilated convolutional (QDC) layer. An example of a QDC layer is illustrated in Fig. 1. Due to the mechanism of dilated convolution , the quantum kernel in our model generally covers larger image patches (i.e. receptive ﬁelds ). For example, a 2 × 2 quantum dilated convolution with dilation rate of 3 has a receptive ﬁeld of 4×4 while the standard quantum convolution with the same kernel size has only a receptive ﬁeld of 2 × 2 . It is noteworthy that even though the quantum dilated convolution is able to expand the receptive ﬁeld the number of data points that are fed into the quantum convolution circuit is the same as the one for the standard quantum convolution. This means that the quantum dilated convolution does not requires more qubits than the standard quantum convolution with the same kernel size."

The main improvement of this approach focuses on the encoder part of the encoderdecoder framework already seen in previous approaches. To incorporate the relationships between schema elements in the encoder, the database schema is translated to a directed graph where each node represents either a table or a column and the edge represents the relationship between the elements. The label in the node represents the name of the table or column appropriately. The columns additionally have their type prepended. All the edges between the nodes are labeled as well to represent the exact relationship they represent. The relationships can be: (1) Column X Column Y relationship where X and Y belong to the same table or X is a foreign key for Y (or vice versa), (2) Column X Table T relationship (or vice versa) where X is the primary key of T or X is a column of T (but not a primary key), and (3) Table T Table R relationship where T has a foreign key column in R (or vice versa) or T and R have foreign keys in both directions."

The main advantage of CNNs is that they use multiple feature extraction stages to automatically and accurately learn important features from the data without any human supervision. Due to this advantage, CNNs have been tremendously successful in a broad array of high-level computer vision problems, including image recognition [2], [3], [4], [5] , object detection [6], [7], [8], and image segmentation [9], [10], [11].

The rationale of the proposed approach is similar in spirit to crossview learning in the audio-visual domain [2]. However, it differs in a core way that we obtain aligned and unaligned views1 from the same modality with wavelet transform. In the absence of the semantic labels, our methodology can be leveraged to generate an endless stream of labeled data. Therefore, it can train the network without any human involvement, which is particularly attractive for on-device learning.

Thus, a possibly better integration and recording counts of different versions of the same article by PlumX could be the main reasons for higher coverage of Mendeley by PlumX."

BSMs contain a wide range of data describing the sending vehicle’s state in time, such as speed, location, and the status of the turn signal [?]. When vehicles and human/non-human drivers have more information about the driving environment around them (such as is provided by BSMs), it follows that they can make safer decisions on the road and drive with higher efﬁciency.

Dilated convolution has been extensively studied in the area of deep learning, but little work has been done to explore it in the context of quantum machine learning.

2110.05428,"data, dataset",,,"Our goal is to recover time-delayed latent causal variables and identify their relations from measured temporal data. Estimating causally-related latent variables from observations is particularly challenging as the latent variables are not uniquely recoverable in the most general case. In this work, we consider both a nonparametric, nonstationary setting and a parametric setting for the latent processes and propose two provable conditions under which temporally causal latent processes can be identiﬁed from their nonlinear mixtures. We propose LEAP, a theoretically-grounded framework that extends Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) by enforcing our conditions through proper constraints in causal process prior. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that temporally causal latent processes are reliably identiﬁed from observed variables under different dependency structures and that our approach considerably outperforms baselines that do not properly leverage history or nonstationarity information. This demonstrates that using temporal information to learn latent processes from their invertible nonlinear mixtures in an unsupervised manner, for which we believe our work is one of the ﬁrst, seems promising even without sparsity or minimality assumptions."

2107.09869,data,,,"Exemplary performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) on ECG [16] and especially the performance of CNN using ID convolution [17] and 2D convolution [18] has recently attracted attention of many researchers. Deep learning models are capable of automatically learning invariant and hierarchical features directly from the data and employ end-to-end learning mechanism that takes data as input and class prediction as output. Recent deep learning models use 1D ECG signal or 2D representation of ECG by transforming ECG signal to images or some matrix form. For 1D ECG classiﬁcation, commonly used deep learning models are deep belief networks, restricted Boltzmann machines, auto encoders, CNN [19] and recurrent neural network (RNN) [20]. For 2D ECG classiﬁcation, CNNs are used and the input ECG data is transformed to images or some other 2D representation. It is experimentally proved in [21] that 2D representation of ECG provides more accurate heartbeat classiﬁcation compared to 1D. In our previous work [22], univariate ECG signal is transformed to images by segmenting ECG signal between successive R-R intervals and then stacking these R-R intervals row wise to form images. Finally, multidomain multimodal fusion is performed to improve the stress assessment. Experimental results proved that multidomain multimodal fusion achieved highest performance as compared to single ECG modality."

Especially, the CKKS scheme has gained lots of interest for a suitable tool of the PPML implementation since it can deal with the encrypted real number naturally. However, these schemes support only homomorphic arithmetic operations such as the homomorphic addition and the homomorphic multiplication. Unfortunately, the popular activation functions are usually non-arithmetic functions, such as ReLU, sigmoid, leaky ReLU, and ELU. Thus, these activation functions cannot be evaluated directly using the word-wise FHE scheme. When the previous machine learning models using FHE replaced the non-arithmetic activation function with the simple polynomials, these models were not proven to show high accuracy for advanced classiﬁcation tasks beyond the MNIST dataset."

This paper proposes a novel uniﬁed approach based on out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and task masking, called CLOM, to solve both problems. The key novelty is that each task is trained as an OOD detection model rather than a traditional supervised learning model, and a task mask is trained to protect each task to prevent forgetting. Our evaluation shows that CLOM outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines by large margins. The average TIL/CIL accuracy of CLOM over six experiments is 87.6/67.9% while that of the best baselines is only 82.4/55.0%. The code of our system is available at https://github.com/k-gyuhak/CLOM."

AHP focuses on pair-wise comparisons between all options for all criteria. The advantage of pair-wise comparisons is that they facilitates a separation of concerns. Rather than worry about the entire problem, the decision maker can focus on one comparison at a time. In our work AHP is used for comparing and ranking the software packages of a domain using the quality scores that are gathered in the Measurement Template (Appendix B). AHP performs a pairwise analysis between each of the 9 quality options for each of the 30 software packages. This results in a matrix, which is used to generate an overall score for each software package for the given criteria. Smith et al.

Moreover, we ensured that the algorithms were calibrated, trained and tested using identical datasets. We empirically observed that the studied algorithms perform overall on-par, with an advantage of CS over DictL and a slight advantage of DL over both. However, due to the pipelines of the subtle data crimes, all of our computations were performed with single-coil magnitude non-negative images; the benchmarking of the algorithms for multi-coil, complex-valued MRI data is beyond the scope of this work and remains for future research."

To overcome this problem we evaluated the y k (xk) and µAi(xk) using the KM and yk corresponding to the µ Ai algorithm [2]. The values of y and yk are optimized parallelly k until the convergence. The another advantage of this approach is that it become more robust in handling noise and provide a conﬁdence interval for every output data points.

2203.0248,"dataset, data repos",,,"Clearly, the prediction of backchannel responses has attracted a lot of attention. However, they are not the only type of non-verbal behavioral social cues. In a more general framework, few works have tried to predict the future development of an interaction leveraging low-level action labels (e.g., speaking, idling, laughing), motivated by the recent release of annotated audiovisual datasets (Alameda-Pineda et al., 2016; Cabrera-Quiros et al., 2018). Sanghvi et al. (2020) proposed a model that used the visual features (e.g., location, gaze orientation) from all interactants to predict the target’s future actions (e.g., speak, listen, leave). To do so, a GRU encoded the features of each interactant concatenated with those from the target person. Then, similarly to the attention-based methods reviewed in Section 2.6.1, their method applied attention across all social encodings, which were then fed to a pooling layer so that an arbitrary number of individuals could be handled. Finally, two dense layers converted the output of the pooling layer to the probability distribution deﬁning the next conversational action. They reported that, thanks to the social attention, group annotations were not required. Airale et al. (2021) also deﬁned the non-verbal behavior forecasting as a discrete multi-sequence generation problem. Their methodology was radically diﬀerent though: a GAN conditioned on the observed interaction, which was encoded with an LSTM. In the generative stage, a socially aware hidden state was computed at each timestep. The strategy consisted in using a pooling module to update the hidden states of each person’s LSTM decoder and convert them to new socially aware LSTM hidden states for the next decoding step. As a result, the decoded actions were obtained in a coherent way with respect to the actions generated for all surrounding subjects. Additionally, they presented a two-streams novel adversarial discriminator. The ﬁrst branch corresponded to the classic one, so it favored the realism of individual action sequences disregarding any contextual information. The second one combined the predicted actions sequences with a pooling module of all individuals in the scene to ensure that the generated interactions as a"

2111.06021,"data, dataset",,,"Recent feature contrastive learning (FCL) has shown promising performance in self-supervised representation learning. For domain adaptation, however, FCL cannot show overwhelming gains since the class weights are not involved during optimization, which does not guarantee the produced features to be clustered around the class weights learned from source data. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel probabilistic contrastive learning (PCL) in this paper, which not only produces compact features but also enforces them to be distributed around the class weights. Speciﬁcally, we propose to use the output probabilities after softmax to perform contrastive learning instead of the extracted features and remove the (cid:96)2 normalization in the traditional FCL. In this way, the probability will approximate the onehot form, thereby narrowing the distance between the features and the class weights. Our proposed PCL is simple and effective. We conduct extensive experiments on two domain adaptation tasks, i.e., unsupervised domain adaptation and semi-supervised domain adaptation. The results on multiple datasets demonstrate that our PCL can consistently get considerable gains and achieves the state-of-theart performance. In addition, our method also obtains considerable gains on semi-supervised tasks when labeled data is scarce."

Multilingual NMT created with or without multiway corpora has been studied for the potential for translation between two languages without any direct parallel corpus. Zero-shot translation is translation using multilingual data to create a translation for languages which have no direct parallel corpora to train independently. Multilingual Neural Machine Translation with only monolingual corpora was studied by (Sen et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019b). In Ha et al.

2110.05428,data,,,"Causal discovery seeks to identify the underlying structure of the data generation process by exploiting an appropriate class of assumptions (Spirtes et al., 1993; Pearl, 2000). Despite its success in certain domains, most existing work either focuses on estimating the causal relations between observed variables (Spirtes & Glymour, 1991; Chickering, 2002; Shimizu et al., 2006), or starts from the premise that causal variables are given beforehand (Spirtes et al., 2013). Real-world observations (e.g., image pixels, sensor measurements, etc.), however, are not structured into causal variables to begin with. Estimating latent causal variable graphs from observations is particularly challenging as the latent variables, even with independent factors of variation (Locatello et al., 2019), are not identiﬁable or “uniquely” recoverable in the most general case (Hyvärinen & Pajunen, 1999). There exist several pieces of work aiming to uncover causally related latent variables. For instance, by exploiting the vanishing Tetrad conditions (Spearman, 1928) one is able to identify latent variables in linear-Gaussian models (Silva et al., 2006), and the so-called Generalized Independent Noise (GIN) condition was proposed to estimate linear, non-Gaussian latent variable causal graph (Xie et al., 2020), with follow-up studies such as (Adams et al., 2021). However, these approaches are constrained within linear relations, need certain types of sparsity or minimality assumptions, and require a relatively large number of measured variables as children of the latent variables. The work of (Bengio et al., 2019; Ke et al., 2019) used “quick adaptation” as the training criteria for learning latent structure but the identiﬁability results have not been theoretically established yet."

A common task of interest is causal structure learning (Pearl, 2009; Peters et al., 2017), which aims at learning a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in which edges represent causal relations between variables. While observational data alone is in general not sufﬁcient to identify the DAG (Yang et al., 2018; Hauser & Bühlmann, 2012), interventional data can improve identiﬁability up to ﬁnding the exact graph (Eberhardt et al., 2005; Eberhardt, 2008). Unfortunately, the solution space of DAGs grows super-exponentially with the variable count, requiring efﬁcient methods for large graphs.

2008.08134,data,,,"Privacy of user data is becoming an ever increasing need for organizations and users alike. Multiple large-scale privacy breaches in the last years showed how critical and vulnerable most of today’s infrastructure is [8]. In particular, there is dispute about the concept of a trusted data curator to whom users send their original data, and who uses this data to build models for diﬀerent tasks such as targeted advertisement. As Kearns and Roth put it in their recent book about ethical algorithms [10], “[to] make sure that the eﬀect of these models respect the societal norms that we want to maintain, we need to learn how to design these goals directly into our algorithms.” In pursue of this goal, the present paper studies how we can implicitly incorporate privacy into a similarity search system. The concept of diﬀerential privacy as introduced by Dwork et al. in [7] deﬁnes privacy in a precise mathematical way that often allows the design of eﬃcient randomized algorithms. In the case of an untrusted data curator, the concept can be extended to local diﬀerential privacy, where users themselves run randomized algorithms to make their data private before sending it to an untrusted curator. This paper proposes two randomized mechanisms when users have a collection of items and are interested in ﬁnding their similarity with other users under the Jaccard similarity in a private manner. The proposed algorithms build upon the papers [11,4,17] and a precise account of the relation will be given in the related work section at the end of this paper. In a nutshell, each user starts by applying MinHash as introduced by Broder [1] with the range compression of Li and K¨onig [12] (Section 3.1) to produce a sketch of their data.

Figure 2a shows that “read”, “transform”, and “write” do scale better than “cg” for an increasing number of data points. They can therefore also be neglected for the runtime of even larger training sets. The “cg” component has the worst complexity: doubling the number of data points increases the runtime by a factor of 3.3. In Figure 2b we proceed as before and ﬁx the number of data points to 215 while varying the number of features from 26 to 214. The result stays the same: solving the system of linear equations is again responsible for over 92 % of the total runtime. Doubling the number of features increases the runtime by roughly a factor of 2.11. Here, a factor of two can be justiﬁed by the fact that the effort for implicitly calculating each matrix entry doubles, since the vectors used in the scalar products have twice the size. Furthermore, the problem becomes more complex in higher dimension, so that it can be observed that more CG iterations are needed to reach a similar accuracy. Again, this factor is problem dependent. In any case, a factor larger than two is to be expected, provided that the additional features actually lift the problem into a higher dimension. First tests have indicated that the factor is close to two if the vectors are only extended with zeros."

These datasets were exported from the ExCAPE database, which was developed by [8]. While it is possible to calibrate a model on the same dataset, on which the model was trained, see Section 3, it could be problematic to decide if a bias of an uncalibrated model is small enough. Therefore, we split training samples into the training and calibration datasets. After training models, we evaluate their performance on the test dataset using precision, sensitivity, and area under the curve receiver operating characteristic (AUC) performance scores. The input datasets were divided into training, calibration and test datasets such that they consist of 640, 200, 160 ligands, respectively, and a ratio of active and inactive ones is sufﬁciently preserved.

In particular, we focus on works that exploit at least one visual cue. We also engage in a discussion where we foresee some methodological gaps that might become future trends in this ﬁeld.

Machine learning and neural networks can also help us to ﬁnd good coarse-graining strategies[23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. If we treat a coarse-graining mapping(or being called renormalization in physics community) as a function from micro-states to macro-states, then we can certainly approximate this function by a parameterized neural network. For example, [26] and [24] used normalized ﬂow model equipped with invertible neural network to learn how to renormalize a multi-dimensional ﬁeld (quantum ﬁeld, images or joint probability distributions) to a set of independent Gaussian noise, and how to generate the same ﬁeld from sampling a set of independent Gaussian noise in the same time merely via running the same model in an inverse way.

To experimentally verify this results, we applied ENCO on this graph with two hyperparameter settings for the sparsity regularizer: λsparse = 0.019 and λsparse = 0.021. We considered a very large sample size, more speciﬁcally 10k per intervention and 100k observational samples, to simulate the data limit regime. For λsparse = 0.019, ENCO was able X2 was, as expected, to recover the graph without errors while for λsparse = 0.021, the edge X1 → missed. This veriﬁes the theoretical result above with respect to λsparse. Note that if the condition is not fulﬁlled by selecting a too large sparsity regularizer, this does not necessarily mean that ENCO will not be able to recover the graph. This is because we consider the ’worst-case’ parent set in condition 3, while this case might not be in the true causal graph to which the other edges converge."

Figure 3(b)(e) shows the regret ratio distribution for STOCPRESGREED. It records the number of times that the regret ratio has fallen into that interval.

In the way of addressing this issue, The presented work portrays a fully Transformer-based reinforcement learning generator-evaluation architecture for neural question generation. To edge the ﬂexibility of the generation, a semantic-based reward score was externally infused during the training to drive the training of the language model. The global architecture is laid out in a generator-evaluator fashion optimized directly to n-gram and semanticbased metrics. Evaluation metrics for language modelling only based on n-gram overlapping do not consider semantic relations between reference and candidate sequences. To improve the evaluation step, a two-fold evaluation was carried out. On the one side, an n-gram overlapping evaluation using the BLEU score. On the other side, a semantic-based assessment using BERTScore and NUBIA. The results were corroborated by a binary human evaluation of the semantic relatedness of the generated question and the ground truth.

In particular, a family of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks, consisting of classical and quantum elements, has been massively explored for the purpose of improving the performance of classical neural networks. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid quantum-classical algorithm called quantum dilated convolutional neural networks (QDCNNs). Our method extends the concept of dilated convolution, which has been widely applied in modern deep learning algorithms, to the context of hybrid neural networks. The proposed QDCNNs are able to capture larger context during the quantum convolution process while reducing the computational cost. We perform empirical experiments on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets for the task of image recognition and demonstrate that QDCNN models generally enjoy better performances in terms of both accuracy and computation efﬁciency compared to existing quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs)."

2105.05076,"data, dataset, data repos",,,"Search depth is defined as the number of intermediate relations that separate a base node from the furthest node connected to it. Within this definition, if the search depth is equal to 1, search results will contain base nodes, that are directly matching the query, and those that are connected to them. The deeper the search is, i.e. the more relation steps are followed between the nodes, the higher the number of results is. In fact, the number of results increases exponentially with the increase of search depth. Therefore, other parameters or search strategies are needed to govern the number of research results provided to the user.  To handle this issue, relation weights are utilized in this work, alongside the search depth, to order search results by relevance and provide the user with a reasonable number of connected documents. In the passive search scenario, triggered by adding components to the design process, this method forms the base of a simple recommendation process, which offers the user hints about relevant maintenance documents that are related to an inserted element and, in general, the current design. Table 1 provides an overview of the relations extracted and utilized in the construction of the knowledge graph. Both inter-node-type and intra-node-type relations are shown in the table, and they highlight the condensed interlinking between failure case node in the graph. This is due to the fact that retrieving previous failure cases, as lessons learned, is the main objective of the graph search. This is also clear from Table 2, where the percentages of node numbers, relative to the total node count in the generated graph, is reported. It is noticeable that within the existing dataset, the number of maintenance documents, represented be FC nodes, is relatively low compared to other types of documents. This is a usual limitation facing industrial datasets, due to the level of digitalization in the factory and the confidentiality of available data. However, through the text mining of maintenance reports’ textual content and the thorough relation extraction between them, they still possess the highest number of links in the graph, which positively influenced their retrieval rates, reaching between 28% and 43% more visibility, depending on the search configurations."

This is due to the fact that the system of equations becomes overdetermined. The solution is retrieved by discarding 6 equations and it is strongly dependent on which equations are discarded, as recognized by [Kuo, 1998] that treats the problem of ﬁnding the joint torques as a least-squares problem. The idea here is to ﬁnd a set of joint torques that best agrees with the available data and to exploit the redundancy of the system when some measurements are missing or unreliable. The main drawback is that it is applicable only to a 2D ﬁxed-base system. In a subsequent study [van den Bogert and Su, 2008], a further development of [Kuo, 1998] is presented, not restricted to 2D ﬁxed-base system but particularly tailored for gait analysis.

Our ‘0 regularization relies on a recently proposed Gaussian-based continuous relaxation of Bernoulli random variables, termed gates [21]. The gates are applied to the input features to sparsify the canonical vectors. The parameters of the gates and of the model are trained jointly via gradient descent to maximize the correlation between the representations of X and Y while simultaneously selecting only the subsets of most correlated input features. By modeling the transformations using two neural networks, our method provides a natural solution to sparse non-linear correlation analysis. We apply the proposed method to synthetic data and demonstrate that our approach can improve the estimation of the canonical vectors compared with existing sparse CCA models. Then, we use the proposed scheme on several real datasets and demonstrate that it leads to more reliable and interpretable representations than other linear and non-linear data fusion schemes."

Future performance analysis should study the effects of keeping vehicle density constant as vehicle count changes (see below). 1) Process: The performance testing was done by artiﬁcially generating BSM data ﬁles and measuring the simulation’s performance in milliseconds when run on these ﬁles. Each generated ﬁle had a different number of vehicles per timestamp (N ); some had as few as 1 vehicle and others had as many as 200 vehicles per timestamp. All vehicles’ positions were constrained within a ﬁxed rectangular area of 348.16 km in Ann Arbor, Michigan (where the Safety Pilot study took place). The vehicles would appear at random points within the green rectangle in Figure 4. Rather than only appearing on road surfaces, to simplify the generation process they could appear at random anywhere within this rectangle. Also, their positions in one timestamp did not inﬂuence their positions in the next timestamp. In the generated data, vehicles were conﬁned to this given territory.

Top-trees allow for shortest path distance queries and least-common ancestor (LCA) queries in time O(log n) per query while using O(n log n) space, and can easily be augmented to support turn queries, as we shall see shortly. To be used as a black box, the MSSP structure relies on being initialized from a face of G. In our construction, we wish to use it for querying left/right turns of paths and distances from vertices residing on shortest paths of fundamental cycle separators, and thus some further preprocessing is required.

Intuitively, ancestors and descendants in the graph have to be dependent when intervening on the ancestors. This aligns with the technical interpretation in Theorem 3.1 that the likelihood estimate of the child variable must improve when intervening and conditioning on its ancestor variables. Condition 3 states intuitively that the sparsity regularizer needs to be selected such that it chooses the sparsest graph among those graphs with equal joint distributions as the ground truth graph, without trading sparsity for worse distribution estimates. The speciﬁc condition in Theorem 3.1 ensures thereby that the set can be learned with a gradient-based algorithm. We emphasize that this condition only gives an upper bound for λsparse when sufﬁciently large datasets are available.

2111.05792,"data, dataset",,,"Adversarial detection. To build a supervised detection model, the tracker needs to gather training data comprising of both non-obfuscated and obfuscated browsing proﬁles. To this end, we assume a strong adversary that has access to sufﬁcient non-obfuscated browsing proﬁles as well as black-box access to obfuscators (including HARPO) that can be used to gather obfuscated browsing proﬁles. To train the classiﬁcation model, we assume that the tracker extracts embedding based content features for all the URLs in the available positive and negative labeled browsing proﬁles. Thus, we assume that the tracker: (1) can track all the URLs in a user’s browsing proﬁle; (2) is able to extract content features for any URL that a user may visit; and (3) has sufﬁcient resources to gather training data and train an ML-based supervised detection model. Based on these assumptions, we design a binary ML classiﬁer that uses the doc2vec embeddings as features of a user browsing proﬁle and outputs a binary detection decision to indicate whether or not a given persona is obfuscated by HARPO (or other obfuscators under consideration). We gather a dataset of obfuscated and non-obfuscated personas containing a total of 20,000 URLs and use a similar 80-20 split to train and test this detector. We then use the detection error as a metric to measure stealthiness–obfuscation is more/less stealthy if the detection error is higher/lower."

In particular, fuzzy c-regression clustering based on type-2 fuzzy set has been shown the remarkable results on non-sparse data but their performance degraded on sparse data. In this paper, an innovative architecture for fuzzy c-regression model is presented and a novel student-t distribution based membership function is designed for sparse data modelling. To avoid the overﬁtting, we have adopted a Bayesian approach for incorporating a Gaussian prior on the regression coefﬁcients. Additional novelty of our approach lies in type-reduction where the ﬁnal output is computed using Karnik Mendel algorithm and the consequent parameters of the model are optimized using Stochastic Gradient Descent method. As detailed experimentation, the result shows that proposed approach outperforms on standard datasets in comparison of various state-of-the-art methods."

We focus here on methods that are relying on an estimate of the state-action value function, known as the Q-function. It is well-known that the Q-function can be estimated by minimizing the mean squared Bellman error. However, the resulting regression problem is not standard as the inputs and the output noise are correlated, leading to some confounding. We show here that ﬁxing the target Q-network in the popular Deep Q-Networks (DQN) (Mnih et al., 2013) and Fitted Q Evaluation (FQE) (Le et al., 2019) can be re-interpreted as a strategy addressing this confounding. We then investigate a diﬀerent class of approaches to address the same problem. In causal inference, Instrumental Variables (IV) regression is a standard strategy for learning causal relationships between confounded treatment and outcome variables from observational data by utilizing an instrumental variable, which aﬀects the outcome only through the treatment (Stock and Trebbi, 2003). The connection between RL and IV ideas was made early on by Bradtke and Barto (1996) when introducing Least Square Temporal Diﬀerences (LSTD), a method to estimate on-policy linearly parameterized value functions. Their derivation made use of the two-stage least squares (2SLS) algorithm, the most standard IV regression technique. However, the connection between RL and IV seemed to have been largely ignored ever since in the literature."

On large-scale optimization tasks involving distributed datasets, decentralized algorithms have shown strong, sometimes superior, performance over distributed algorithms with a central node. Recently, developing decentralized algorithms for deep learning has attracted great attention. They are considered as low-communication-overhead alternatives to those using a parameter server or the Ring-Allreduce protocol. However, the lack of an easy-to-use and efﬁcient software package has kept most decentralized algorithms merely on paper. To ﬁll the gap, we introduce BlueFog, a python library for straightforward, high-performance implementations of diverse decentralized algorithms. Based on a uniﬁed abstraction of various communication operations, BlueFog offers intuitive interfaces to implement a spectrum of decentralized algorithms, from those using a static, undirected graph for synchronous operations to those using dynamic and directed graphs for asynchronous operations. BlueFog also adopts several system-level acceleration techniques to further optimize the performance on the deep learning tasks. On mainstream DNN training tasks, BlueFog reaches a much higher throughput and achieves an overall 1.2× ∼ 1.8× speedup over Horovod, a state-of-the-art distributed deep learning package based on Ring-Allreduce.

For all the other datasets, the near equivalence of the Pareto frontiers for the two α discretizations suggests that a good performance of the I-TAP method can be achieved with coarse discretizations of the convex combination parameter set.

For VAR processes, we create datasets: (1) with causal relations changing over regime, and (2) with instantaneous causal relations, (3) with Gaussian noise, and (4) with low-rank state transition matrices. For NP processes, we violate (5) the sufﬁcient variability by creating datasets with fewer than the required 2n + 1 = 17 regimes. We ﬁt LEAP on these datasets without any modiﬁcation. Our framework can gain partial identiﬁability under (1,4) but violating (2) conditional independence and (3) non-Gaussianity distort the results obviously. Our approach, although designed to model nonstationarity by noise, can be extended to model changing causal relations. The partial identiﬁability of (4) is because the low-dimensional projections of the latent processes are recovered, as illustrated by a numerical example in Appendix A.2.4. For NP processes, nonstationarity is necessary for identiﬁability. Furthermore, the differences of the MCC trajectories under 15 and 20 regimes seem marginal, suggesting that our approach does not always require at least 2n + 1 = 17 regimes to achieve full identiﬁability of the latent processes."

2104.09994,"data, dataset",,,"Billions of IoT devices lacking proper security mechanisms have been manufactured and deployed for the last years, and more will come with the development of Beyond 5G technologies. Their vulnerability to malware has motivated the need for eﬃcient techniques to detect infected IoT devices inside networks. With data privacy and integrity becoming a major concern in recent years, increasing with the arrival of 5G and Beyond networks, new technologies such as federated learning and blockchain emerged. They allow training machine learning models with decentralized data while preserving its privacy by design. This work investigates the possibilities enabled by federated learning concerning IoT malware detection and studies security issues inherent to this new learning paradigm. In this context, a framework that uses federated learning to detect malware aﬀecting IoT devices is presented. N-BaIoT, a dataset modeling network traﬃc of several real IoT devices while aﬀected by malware, has been used to evaluate the proposed framework. Both supervised and unsupervised federated models (multi-layer perceptron and autoencoder) able to detect malware aﬀecting seen and unseen IoT devices of N-BaIoT have been trained and evaluated. Furthermore, their performance has been compared to two traditional approaches. The ﬁrst one lets each participant locally train a model using only its own data, while the second consists of making the participants share their data with a central entity in charge of training a global model. This comparison has shown that the use of more diverse and large data, as done in the federated and centralized methods, has a considerable positive impact on the model performance. Besides, the federated models, while preserving the participant’s privacy, show similar results as the centralized ones. As an additional contribution and to measure the robustness of the federated approach, an adversarial setup with several malicious participants poisoning the federated model has been considered. The baseline model aggregation averaging step used in most federated learning algorithms appears highly vulnerable to diﬀerent attacks, even with a single adversary. The performance of other model aggregation functions acting as countermeasures is thus evaluated under the same attack scenarios. These functions provide a signiﬁcant improvement against malicious participants, but more eﬀorts are still needed to make federated approaches robust."

On the Intel® Atom™ the average latency increases to an average 18ms. Plausibility checking here takes an average of 5ms on the Core™ system to process about 30 objects. On the Atom™ the latency increases to an average 13ms. Those results indicate that our monitor architecture is indeed lightweight, meaning that it is feasible to run the veriﬁcation process at pseudo-real-time (typically ≈ 50ms − 100ms) on a safety-certiﬁable hardware. Note that the minimum latency target for an unobstructed system execution is eventually determined by the processing time of the parallel primary perception channel. The implementation of the code is not yet optimized and runs on a single core. The plausibility checks are currently implemented in Python and singlethreaded. With parallelism and other optimization techniques the latency could therefore be reduced further if required. Also using a non-uniform grid representation [22] can improve the latency of the sensor checks."

To improve overall safety, we envision that this perception monitor is coupled with a supervisor for the AD planning system, such as for example RSS. Compared to existing monitor approaches, our concept is characterized by two key advantages: i) The checks are designed to be effective yet simple, in order to reduce computational load, ii) We combine diverse sensor-dependent and sensor-independent methods to address both fault-tolerance against commoncause sensor failures and SOTIF. We evaluated the monitor in simulation, using CARLA, and performed additional tests with the NuScenes dataset. Our experiments demonstrate a high recall and precision (both > 90%) for the detection of both permanent and random position errors larger than at most 0.7m. A comparable detection performance is found for transient speed errors greater than 2m/s or permanent ones greater than 6m/s. Except for the permanent speed errors, those values are more than sufﬁcient to detect the targeted errors of about 1m position and 3m/s velocity deviations, which we identiﬁed as a representative estimate for safetycritical perception errors in a wide spectrum of situations."

One might think of this as students in a class who come up with new ways of copying their assignments from sources as plagiarism detectors improved. That brings us to one of the many applications of paraphrases: plagiarism generation and detection, which inherently is an adversarial activity.

To model such interactions, they proposed a method which learnt a semantic graph of human-object interactions during the past observations. Then, the interactions graph was recurrently injected to a RNN in order to generate a context encoding. Both context vector and observed body poses were jointly decoded by a fully connected layer to predict the residuals (motion) of the next pose. As a result, their learnt behavioral model recognized and adapted to the particular dynamics of the scene. Additionally, they proposed to use the context vector to also predict the future motion of the scene objects, and update the context vector accordingly. They reported that their method was state of the art in what scene and human activities understanding refers. With a similar concept in mind, Adeli et al. (2020) proposed an action-agnostic context-aware method. The main diﬀerence is that they used spatio-temporal visual features directly extracted from the scene image, so-called context"

Over time, these metrics evolved significantly in several ways and now it is a quite comprehensive altmetric aggregator. Plum Analytics considered as many as 67 different types of outputs to be tracked, which are named as ‘artifacts’. These artifacts include scholarly articles, books, book chapters, conference articles. In addition, it also includes speeches, visual arts, images, figures etc. Currently, PlumX track metrics over 180 million research outputs. It covers a very wide variety of social platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube; online knowledge sharing mediums, such as StackExchange, Wikipedia, Github; and bibliographical data-based sites, such as Scopus, SciELO, RePEcetc. It organizes the captured data in five different types of metrics- usages, captures, mentions, citations, and social media16. The data for artifacts is collected from multiple platforms using different methods and tools. These include data provider APIs, third party APIs, FTP data transfers, OAI-PMH harvesting, Web crawlers, and RSS feeds17. For example, it updates twitter metrics in real time using GNIP API, whereas Facebook Graph API is used with daily update for Facebook data (Zahedi & Costas, 2018b).

Background and Impact Code of conduct, that is some special restrictions of people's behavior in certain public scenes such as no smoking in gas stations, no calling for drivers, no taking photos in museums, etc. In fact, these behaviors have been causing huge disasters. 2.5 million nonsmoker adults have died because they breathed the 1965 Surgeon’s Report [1]. secondhand smoke since Concretely, smoking during pregnancy results in more than 1,000 infants deaths annually; 34,000 premature deaths have been caused by secondhand smoke from heart disease each year in the United States among nonsmokers; Secondhand smoke causes more than 7,300 lung cancer deaths among U.S. nonsmokers each year [2]. Besides, calling in inappropriate environments also results in some irreparable damage. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year and nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting and driving. In fact 94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving. All in all, a detection system is urgently needed to determine whether people perform such dangerous behavior in certain environments to help the accidents and death caused by smoking and reduce calling.This report will introduce a practical pipeline to finish the behavior classification of smoking,calling ,normal and smokingcalling. In order to achieve high accuracy, we focus on deep learning methods with very deep convolutional neural networks such as inception V3. Since 2014,very deep convolutional neural networks have been proposed and become the must-have weapon for champions in all kinds of competition. This project tries to assess classification methods quantitatively and qualitatively. Since manual check for this dangerous behavior is laboursome and expensive, if such a system is deployed in a variety of public places that can be monitored, people who smoke will be given a warning and drivers will realize a risky behavior they do just now. In this way, second smoking will be reduced and help build a fresh environment to improve the quality of life and accidents will also be avoided when a system tries to hold back the calling behavior of some drivers."

In terms of number of journals for which data is covered, the PlumX aggregator has an edge over Altmetric.com. For example, PlumX covers 76 more journals of Springer than Altmetric.com, 34 more journals of Elsevier and 31 more journals of Taylor & Francis. It can be further observed that PlumX covers more than 90% of publication records for all Publishers except for Cambridge Univ Press (84.1%), whereas coverage of Altmetric.com varies between 25% to 86%. Altmetric.com has minimum coverage of about 25% for IEEE and highest coverage of 86.88% for PLoS publications. In terms of coverage and mentions for the four platforms, it is found that Altmetric.com has higher coverage in Twitter for almost all publishers. In Facebook platform, Altmetric.com shows higher coverage for all publishers except PLoS, Hindawi, and MDPI. In Mendeley platform, the coverage and average reads captured by PlumX are higher for all publishers except Springer, IEEE, Taylor & Francis, ACM and Hindawi. In case of Blog platform, Altmetric.com has in general better coverage and average mention values than PlumX, though for IEEE, IOP, Hindawi and Emerald publishers, the PlumX aggregators capture more mentions. Thus, in general it is observed that Altmetric.com has better coverage of Twitter and PlumX has better coverage of Facebook, irrespective of the publisher. However, in case of Mendeley and Blog platforms, the coverage and mention values of the two aggregators vary for different publishers, with no definite pattern observed across all publishers."

In this case, the networks are trained with a batch size of 12 for 5 local epochs using data of n randomly selected users (typically 10) at each training round with 30 − 50 rounds in total, depending on the dataset size. Speciﬁcally, in our experiments, we randomly divide the training set into multiple subsets (representing each client) that are used to train the models in a federated setting. We opt for this strategy due to fewer users in existing datasets. The availability of bigger datasets with a larger pool of users could be useful to evaluate self-supervised methods in the future.

2111.06021,data,,,"For the domain adaptation task, it is difﬁcult for the features in target domain to form semantically compact clusters as the target data lacks the supervision signals. Consequently, various categories of the target domain are hard to be distinguished, as shown in Figure 1(a). As we all know, the instance contrastive learning methods based on InfoNCE loss [41] can learn semantically compact feature representations on unlabeled data, which means that contrastive learning tends to cluster together semantically similar features [5, 66, 6, 27]. Many works have shown that the model trained in this way has good transferability [20, 7, 78]. Therefore, a straightforward idea for domain adaptation is that we perform supervised learning in source domain while performing contrastive learning in target domain, where it is expected that each category in the target domain is easy to be distinguished with semantically compact representations, as shown in Figure 1(b). However, our study experiments found that the gain from this way is very limited, and even no obvious gain is got for the model equipped with a strong consistency constraint, as shown in Figure 2."

Since the considered cost function does not contain information on the joint torques, the method is not so robust to errors in the joint torque estimation. In [Riemer and Hsiao-Wecksler, 2008], a similar methodology is used but combining two important factors: i) a cost function that minimizes the difference between the measured ground reaction forces and the forces estimated via a top-down approach; ii) an optimization criterion for the measured joint angles."

The goal is that the probabilities corresponding to the edges of the ground truth graph converge to one, while the probabilities of all other edges converge to zero. For this to happen, we exploit the idea of independent causal mechanisms (Pearl, 2009; Peters et al., 2016), according to which the conditional distributions for all variables in the ground-truth CGM stay invariant under an intervention, except for the intervened ones. By contrast, for graphs modelling the same joint distribution but with a ﬂipped or additional edge, this does not hold (Peters et al., 2016). In short, we search for the graph which generalizes best from observational to interventional data. To implement the optimization, we alternate between two learning stages, that is distribution ﬁtting and graph ﬁtting, visually summarized in Figure 1."

Traditional methods mostly impose handcrafted constraints as priors to restrict the space of solutions. Early works [3,4,37] of Super-Resolution used multiple shifted low-resolution images of the same scene to retrieve the latent high resolution image conditioned on the motion between the LR images [3]. The performance of these algorithms, however, are highly dependent on the motion estimates. To address this, in [35], a motion free super-resolution was attempted by analytically deriving the relation for the reconstruction of the super-resolved image from its blurred and downsampled versions. With the availability of Large-scale Image Datasets and the consistent success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), learning (rather than handcrafting) a prior from a set of natural images became a possibility.

The regressor is a feedforward neural network with two hidden layers, each of 10 units, and hyperbolic tangent as activation function. As for the previous benchmark, we use the mean squared error as loss. We employ the same values of step-size α and mini-batch M for both H-SGD and SGD, where the step-size value is tuned based on the numerical performance of SGD for the selected mini-batch size (M = 5). Regarding H-SGD, we set yj,0 = x2 j + (cid:15)j with (cid:15)j ∼ N (0, 0.01) and employ the same homotopy mapping as in Equation 16. As shown in Figure 6 in the Appendix, also in this scenario H-SGD shows a superior numerical performance than SGD, i.e. H-SGD reaches a loss of 10−1 roughly 4 times faster and achieves convergence more than 2 times faster than SGD. The superior numerical performance of H-SGD can be attributed to its ability of tracking a solution across homotopy iterations (see Figure 10 in the Appendix) which ensures the method to always work in the vicinity of a minimizer."

The orthographic unit is a linguistically motivated unit which occurs in a sequence of one or more consonants followed by a vowel.

As orthographic syllable and BPE are variable-length units and the vocabularies used are much smaller than morpheme and word-level model, the problem of data sparsity does not occur but provides an appropriate context for translation between closely related languages (Kunchukuttan et al., 2017)."

It is possible to express grids quite simply if the relations used to express the grid structure make use of the geometry of the plane. However, automated instance generation should not restrict the choices made in modelling problems. In the IPC-14 benchmark dataset, all instances of floor-tile have the tiles forming a square-grid structure and tiles’ connections are represented using adjacency relations left, right, up and down. Validity constraints to ensure that these adjacency relations express a square-grid map cannot be eﬃciently modelled using PDDL due to the limited expressiveness of ﬁrst-order logic. Checking that the adjacency relations form a valid grid requires reconstructing geometric information about placement of tiles on the plane. Although it is possible to express the property that the adjacency relations form a grid for special cases, even this requires solving a challenging tiling problem, and the general case is currently open [15]."

There have been quite a few researches attempting to generate data processing results by directly linking records in the tables to the semantic meaning of the natural language input, such as [6] and [7]. However, these attempts are not scalable to big tables and are not reusable when the database schema is changed. More recent approaches use only the natural language input and the database schema and metadata to generate the queries. We review the most recent approaches in our research. Furthermore, the release of large annotated datasets containing questions and the corresponding database queries has additionally enhanced the ability to use deep learning or supervised techniques to tackle this problem. This has enabled the problem to evolve into a more complex task where the approaches should be domain independent and involving multiple tables with complex queries."

The major advantages of MRI include its non-invasive nature and the fact that it does not use radiation for imaging. However, the major drawback of MRI is the long acquisition time, which causes discomfort to patients and hinders applications in time critical diagnoses. This relatively slow acquisition process could result in signiﬁcant artefacts due to patient movement and physiological motion. The slow acquisition time of MRI can be attributed to data samples not being collected directly in the image space but rather in k-space. k-space contains spatial-frequency information that is acquired line-by-line by the MRI hardware. In order to accelerate the MRI acquisition process, various methods ranging from Partial Fourier Imaging, Compressed Sensing and Dictionary Learning have been developed [4]."

ResNet is one of the historic convolutional neural network (CNN) models which enables a very deep neural network with high accuracy for complex datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Many high-performance works for image classiﬁcation are based on the ResNet model since these models can reach sufﬁciently high classiﬁcation accuracy by stacking more layers. We ﬁrstly apply the ReLU function based on the composition of minimax approximate polynomials [1] to the encrypted data. Using the results, we ﬁrstly show the possibility of applying the FHE with the bootstrapping to the standard deep machine learning model by implementing ResNet-20 over the RNS-CKKS scheme. We use the RNS-CKKS bootstrapping with the SEAL library [14]. The SEAL library is one of the most practical RNS-CKKS libraries, but it does not support the bootstrapping technique.

The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol (MQTT) is a lightweight client and server topic-based publish/subscribe messaging transport protocol [28, 60]. It is specially suited for constrained environments (e.g., IoT) where memory and bandwidth are very scarce resources. In the protocol, a client publishes a message to a topic. Dedicated processes (i.e., the brokers) forward it to every subscriber for that same topic. The protocol supports decentralized deployments, in which brokers are organized in a layout and messages are routed and forwarded along the established routing tree. The de facto standard open-source C-based implementation of MQTT is mosquitto, actively maintained by the Eclipse Foundation [54]. We implement MQT-TZ atop mosquitto and introduces additional security guarantees leveraging ARM TRUSTZONE, as described next. TRUSTZONE & OP-TEE. TRUSTZONE [1] is a feature implemented in ARM processors since Arm1176JZ-S (2004). It implements a trusted execution environment that is primarily used to guarantee system-wide hardware isolation. Data and code are shielded from compromised environments. The TRUSTZONE architecture physically separates the device in two distinct execution environments, i.e., the trusted side (TEE - secure world) and the untrusted side, i.e., Rich Execution Environment REE or normal world [6]. TRUSTZONE shields against an attacker with physical access to the device, as well as higher-privileged software or malicious kernels running in the REE. The former hosts the so-called Trusted Applications (TAs). Trusted applications can leverage additional TRUSTZONE-only services, such as tamper-proof persistent storage via specialized APIs. The integrity of a TRUSTZONE-enabled device can be guaranteed by a secure boot mechanism.1 Its root of trust builds on Hardware Unique Keys (HUK) embedded in the processor during manufacturing. A common assumption is that only trustworthy TAs are deployed inside the secure world. The Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment (OP-TEE) [36] is an open-source runtime for TEE applications sponsored by the Linaro Foundation [4] with native support for TRUSTZONE. It is designed to run together with a nonsecure Linux kernel in the REE. Finally, OP-TEE is compliant with the GlobalPlatform’s speciﬁcations [25]."

Let us assume that we aim to develop a robust sleep stage classiﬁcation model that can be used for a larger population of users. The standard methodology is to learn a supervised model and requires example-label pairs for providing supervision so that a model can differentiate among instances of multiple classes through learning underlying patterns in the input. The procedure begins with the data collection to monitor hundreds of users for electroencephalography (EEG) or other signals as they progress through various stages of sleep and accumulate the multi-sensor data in a centralized (data center) repository for further analysis. The next step is then to get the aggregated inputs annotated by the sleep expert (i.e., generally a professional trained in analyzing physiological signals) for the sleep classes, such as wake, N1, N2, N3, and rapid eye movement. Then, the learning and evaluation phase involves several iterations of improving the model performance. Lastly, the model is deployed in the wild for user monitoring. The process of model development, from data collection to annotation, could be extremely costly owing to the difﬁculty in setting up an experimental (data collection) protocol. Furthermore, the domain expertise required for the labeling could be severely limited. This problem is exacerbated by the need of supervised deep neural network models for a massive amount of labeled data to learn discriminative to inspect and features. It becomes painstakingly difﬁcult annotate hundreds of thousands of hours of multi-sensor data. Therefore, in practice, limited-sized sensor data are collected and labeled for learning the model, which could further affect its generalization.

The term inverse crime describes a scenario in which an algorithm is tested using simulated data, and the simulation resonates with the algorithm such that it leads to improved results [30–34]. Speciﬁcally, the authors of [33] described an inverse crime as a situation where the same discrete model is used for simulating k-space measurements and reconstructing an MR image from them; they showed that this leads to reduced ringing artifacts compared with reconstruction from raw or analytically-computed measurements. A second example is evaluation of MRI reconstruction algorithms on real-valued magnitude images; in this case k-space exhibits conjugate symmetry, hence it is sufﬁcient to use only about half of it for full image recovery. This symmetry is often leveraged in Partial Fourier methods such as Homodyne [15] and POCS [35], where additional steps are applied for recovery of the full complex data. However, neglecting the data complexity creates a better-conditioned inverse problem and may hence lead to an obvious advantage when evaluating the algorithm on such data as opposed to raw k-space data.

In MULTI-EPOCH AGGREGATION, the model is trained for all 𝐸 epochs at once before being sent to the server for aggregation.

Our goal was to effectively augment how paraphrase detectors are trained, in order to make them less reliant on word-level similarity.

2107.10483,data,,,"We make the following four contributions. Firstly, we propose ENCO, a causal structure learning method for observational and interventional data using continuous optimization. Different from recent methods, ENCO models the edge orientation as a separate parameter. Secondly, we derive unbiased, low-variance gradient estimators, which is crucial for scaling up the model to large numbers of variables. Thirdly, we show that ENCO is guaranteed to converge to the correct causal graph if interventions on all variables are available, despite not having any acyclicity constraints. Yet, we show in practice that the algorithm works on partial intervention sets as well. Fourthly, we extend ENCO to detecting latent confounders. In various experimental settings, ENCO recovers graphs accurately, making less than one error on graphs with 1,000 variables in less than nine hours of computation."

We used a relatively large initial learning rate, as the introduction of cosine decay means that we can use a much larger initial learning rate and let it drop over time, resulting in a reduction of training time by over a third. Finally, we implemented a callback function to automatically track the improvement of the model, and to stop training early if the validation accuracy starts to degrade, indicating that the model is starting to overtrain.

2108.02756,data,,,"Abstract—The design of additive imperceptible perturbations to the inputs of deep classiﬁers to maximize their misclassiﬁcation rates is a central focus of adversarial machine learning. An alternative approach is to synthesize adversarial examples from scratch using GAN-like structures, albeit with the use of large amounts of training data. By contrast, this paper considers oneshot synthesis of adversarial examples; the inputs are synthesized from scratch to induce arbitrary soft predictions at the output of pre-trained models, while simultaneously maintaining high similarity to speciﬁed inputs. To this end, we present a problem that encodes objectives on the distance between the desired and output distributions of the trained model and the similarity between such inputs and the synthesized examples. We prove that the formulated problem is NP-complete. Then, we advance a generative approach to the solution in which the adversarial examples are obtained as the output of a generative network whose parameters are iteratively updated by optimizing surrogate loss functions for the dual-objective. We demonstrate the generality and versatility of the framework and approach proposed through applications to the design of targeted adversarial attacks, generation of decision boundary samples, and synthesis of low conﬁdence classiﬁcation inputs. The approach is further extended to an ensemble of models with different soft output speciﬁcations. The experimental results verify that the targeted and conﬁdence reduction attack methods developed perform on par with stateof-the-art algorithms."

On P-PEAKS 20-100, we can ﬁnd a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the diﬀerent migration gaps when the number of utilized cores is 2, 4, 16, and 32. In contrast, no signiﬁcant diﬀerence is found when using 8 and 64 cores. Especially when using 64 cores, there is no signiﬁcant difference. This indicates that the migration gap does not signiﬁcantly impact when using 64 cores for the small problem. As another interesting ﬁnding, when using 32 or fewer cores, the migration gap of 32 achieves the highest speedup performance. It is worth noting that a super-linear speed-up is observed in some settings, i.e., the cases when using 2 and 4 cores."
2106.08752,"data, dataset",,,"Accurate cardiac segmentation is an essential prerequisite for many medical applications, such as 3D modeling and functional analysis, which are important for diagnosis of cardiac diseases [1, 2]. In clinics, multi-modality medical images are widely used to assist diagnosis. However, obtaining the automated segmentation for all modality images can be label intensive and expensive. To alleviate this, an eﬀective learning-based approach is to train an automatic segmentation model using existing labeled data of one modality and adapt this model for the automatic segmentation of the other modalities. However, the performance of such adapted segmentation models usually degrades signiﬁcantly when they are tested on images from new modalities, due to dataset bias, which is also known as domain shift [3]."

Any users with the public key can process the encrypted real or complex data with the CKKS scheme without knowing any private information. The security of the CKKS scheme is based on the Ring-LWE hardness assumption. The supported homomorphic operations are the addition, the multiplication, the rotation, and the complex conjugation operation, and each operation except the homomorphic rotation operation is applied component-wisely. The rotation operation homomorphically performs a cyclic shift of the vector by some step. The multiplication, rotation, and complex conjugation operations in the CKKS scheme need additional corresponding evaluation keys and the key-switching procedures. Each real number data is scaled with some big integer, called the scaling factor, and then rounded to the integer before encrypting the data. When the two data encrypted with the CKKS scheme are multiplied homomorphically, the scaling factors of the two data are also multiplied. This scaling factor should be reduced to the original value using the rescaling operation for the following operations."

Unit cells are biased in a column-wise fashion by applying DC voltages to 3 of the patches, with the remaining two patches connected to ground. The patch widths and spacing were optimised through a particle swarm optimisation algorithm in order to maximise the achievable phase resolution whilst keeping the average reﬂection loss below 1dB. The components used in this unit cell design are Skyworks SMP1321-040LF PIN diodes and an AVX U-Series 3.6 pF 0402 capacitor.

The other hyperparameters with respect to the neural networks were kept the same as ENCO for a fair comparison. We show all details of the hyperparameter search in Table 4. The best combination of regularizers found was λsparse = 0.02 and λDAG = 0.5. Lower values of λsparse lead to more false positives, especially in sparse graphs, while a lower value of λDAG caused many two-variable loops. Compared to the reported hyperparameter by Ke et al. (2019) (λDAG = 0.5, λsparse = 0.1), we found a lower sparsity regularizer to work better. This is likely because of testing SDI on larger graphs. In contrast to ENCO, SDI needed a lower learning rate for γ due to its higher variance gradient estimators. To compensate for it, we ran it for 50 instead of 30 epochs. In general, SDI achieved lower scores than in the original experiments by Ke et al. (2019) which was because of the larger graph size and smaller dataset size.

They pass all training samples in one iteration. Therefore we consider terms epoch and iteration as identical in this text. In other words, we do not take into account a batch of a training dataset during the training phase of the classiﬁer. By this, we obtain strictly settled and reproducible training pipelines, unlike employing DNNs or other traditionally used techniques. On the other hand, deterministic solvers suffer on their cost in the sense of computational resources. Thus, training predictors can take longer than in the case of stochastic optimization.

Since our feature extractor is smooth with respect to real degradations, its output does not vary wildly when we move from clean images to degraded images. The SR module which produces clean HR images from features extracted by the smooth feature extractor, thus, produce similar images regardless of the degradation.

2104.00098,data,,,Assessment of Theoretical Upper Bounds. We ﬁrst assess the theoretical upper bounds on the ineﬃciency ratio and level of unfairness that were obtained in Section 4.2 with respect to the convex combination parameter α. The latter is obtained using a dense sampling method with increments of 0.01. We present the results for the Prenzlauerberg data-set and note that the results and the following discussion extend to other problem instances in Table 1 as well.

2107.10483,data,,,"When taking the next step to having M interventions provided, ENCO can create more incorrect predictions. For the variables for which interventions are provided, we can use the same convergence guarantees (Theorem B.1-B.4) since all conditions are independent across variables. For variables without interventions, we cannot rely on those. While we have observed that learning the missing θ’s from other interventions give reasonable results, we see a degradation of performance the further the distance is between a node and the closest intervened variable. As an example, suppose we have a X5, and we are provided with an intervention chain with 5 variables, i.e. X1 → X4 → X2 → on X1 only. This allows us to learn the orientation between X1 and X2. The orientation between X2 and X3 is often learned correctly as well because adding the edge X2 → X2 gives a greater decrease in overall log-likelihood, since part of the information from X3 to predict X2 is already included in X1. However, the further we go away from X1, the less information is shared between the child and the intervened variable. Moreover, the likelihood of a mistake occurring due to X5 is not always learned limited data further increases. This is why the orientation of the edge X4 → correctly, which can also cause false positive edges."

2105.10148,data,,,"We note that the derivation by Bradtke and Barto (1996) requires that the value function lives in the linear subspace of the features, Equation (12). Then they show that as the number of data increases, the solution converges under regularity conditions to the least-square ﬁxed-point approximation (without mentioning it). The instrumental variable interpretation also requires the structural function in Equation (14) to hold, which is derived from Equation (12). Convergence of the LSTD algorithm does not require Equation (12) to be valid, however Lagoudakis and Parr (2003) show that there is indeed no need to make such an assumption, and obtain a direct derivation by leastsquare ﬁxed-point approximation. We refer the readers to Lagoudakis and Parr (2003) for this alternative interpretation."

In contrast to the SMO method that is used in most state-of-the-art implementations, it includes all data points as support vectors to compute the class-separating hyperplane. While SMO has limited parallelization potential, the LS-SVM approach is wellsuited for massively parallel hardware and thus large data sets. PLSSVM is the very ﬁrst SVM implementation supporting multiple backends—OpenMP, CUDA, OpenCL, and SYCL— to be able to target different hardware platforms from various vendors, being it CPUs or GPUs."

The images were re-sampled to an axial view size of 256 × 256. Background was then cropped such that the distance between any labeled pixel and the image borders is at least 30 pixels, and scans were again resized to 256 × 256. Finally, each 3D scan was normalized independently to zero mean and unit variance, and values more than three standard deviation from the mean were clipped. Data augmentation was performed as follows on both the training MR and training CT instances to improve generalization: (1) random rotations of up to 20 degrees, (2) negating pixel values, (3) adding random Gaussian noise, (4) random cropping."

One exception is that we allow the ﬁne-tuning of the regularizer parameter for both sets. For ENCO, we used a slightly smaller regularizer, λsparse = 0.002, for the small graphs, and a larger one, λsparse = 0.02, for the large graphs. Due to the large amount of deterministic variables, ENCO tends to predict more false positives in the beginning before removing them one by one. For SDI, we also found a smaller regularizer, λsparse = 0.01, to work best for the small graphs. However, in line with the results of Ke et al. (2019), SDI was not able to detect all edges. Even lower regularizers showed to perform considerably worse on the child dataset, while minor improvements were made on the small graphs. Hence, we settled for λsparse = 0.01. In terms of run time, both methods used 100 epochs for the small graphs and 50 for the large graphs."

2109.12907,data,,,"New initiatives that try to change this old paradigm of publishing are proposed, together with new publishing workflows. This paradigm shift entails to move from the textual representation of information to a more data-centric one, similar to the proposal for the next-generation Web [1], where instead of documents, the interest shifts from the syntactic (e.g. HTML) to the semantic level (e.g. RDF, OWL). On the semantic level, we would be able to express the content and not just the structure of what is now in narrative documents. Moreover, formats that are based on HTML, like RASH [33], have been proposed, where scientific articles that include semantic annotations can be represented. Other initiatives involve using semantic representations from the start, written by the actual authors of the research in what is named genuine semantic publishing [27], and we have proposed in our earlier work to move from the monolithic form structure of scientific articles to smaller, more granular interconnected parts that each contain single scientific claims or statements from the start [7]."

2107.10483,data,,,"Learning the structure of a causal graphical model using both observational and interventional data is a fundamental problem in many scientiﬁc ﬁelds. A promising direction is continuous optimization for score-based methods, which, however, require constrained optimization to enforce acyclicity or lack convergence guarantees. In this paper, we present ENCO, an efﬁcient structure learning method for directed, acyclic causal graphs leveraging observational and interventional data. ENCO formulates the graph search as an optimization of independent edge likelihoods, with the edge orientation being modeled as a separate parameter. Consequently, we provide for ENCO convergence guarantees when interventions on all variables are available, without having to constrain the score function with respect to acyclicity. In experiments, we show that ENCO can efﬁciently recover graphs with hundreds of nodes, an order of magnitude larger than what was previously possible, while handling deterministic variables and discovering latent confounders."

2103.16349,"data, dataset",,,"However, phase is much more tricky. On the one hand, longer time series provide more evident periodic patterns that can not be reﬂected in short horizons. This increases the chance that the HI be of similar phase as the prediction target, especially in the case that the prediction length is an exact integer multiple of the time series’ period when their is any. On the other hand, HI could also badly hurt the prediction results when 1) there is no periodic pattern; 2) the periodic pattern is not included in historical data; 3) or the historical data is in opposite phase as the prediction target. The multivariate prediction results on ETTm1 dataset serves a good evidence of above statements. Since the data was sampled by 15-minute, a prediction length of 24 or 48 is too short to reﬂect periodic patterns. Therefore, HI performs much worse than SOTA models.

2106.07229,"data, dataset",,,"Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) is one of the prospective tools for privacypreserving machine learning (PPML), and several PPML models have been proposed based on various FHE schemes and approaches. Although the FHE schemes are known as suitable tools to implement PPML models, previous PPML models on FHE encrypted data are limited to only simple and non-standard types of machine learning models. These non-standard machine learning models are not proven efﬁcient and accurate with more practical and advanced datasets. Previous PPML schemes replace non-arithmetic activation functions with simple arithmetic functions instead of adopting approximation methods and do not use bootstrapping, which enables continuous homomorphic evaluations. Thus, they could not use standard activation functions and could not employ a large number of layers. The maximum classiﬁcation accuracy of the existing PPML model with the FHE for the CIFAR-10 dataset was only 77% until now. In this work, we ﬁrstly implement the standard ResNet-20 model with the RNS-CKKS FHE with bootstrapping and verify the implemented model with the CIFAR-10 dataset and the plaintext model parameters. Instead of replacing the non-arithmetic functions with the simple arithmetic function, we use state-of-the-art approximation methods to evaluate these non-arithmetic functions, such as the ReLU, with sufﬁcient precision [1]. Further, for the ﬁrst time, we use the bootstrapping technique of the RNS-CKKS scheme in the proposed model, which enables us to evaluate a deep learning model on the encrypted data. We numerically verify that the proposed model with the CIFAR-10 dataset shows 98.67% identical results to the original ResNet-20 model with non-encrypted data. The classiﬁcation accuracy of the proposed model is 90.67%, which is pretty close to that of the original ResNet-20 CNN model. It takes about 4 hours for inference on a dual Intel Xeon Platinum 8280 CPU (112 cores) with 512 GB memory. We think that it opens the possibility of applying the FHE to the advanced deep PPML model."

2106.07229,"data, dataset",,,"HE-friendly network Some previous works re-design the machine learning model compatible with the HE scheme by replacing the standard activation functions with the simple non-linear polynomials [16, 17, 18, 19], called the HE-friendly network. However, these machine learning models are usually successful only for the simple MNIST dataset and cannot reach sufﬁciently high accuracy for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The highest classiﬁcation accuracy of the HE-friendly CNN with the simple polynomial activation function implemented by word-wise HE is only 77% for the CIFAR-10 dataset [19]. Since the choice of the activation functions is sensitive in the advanced machine learning model, it may not be desirable to replace the standard and famous activation functions with simple arithmetic functions. Moreover, the additional pre-training process has to be followed before the PPML service is given. Since the training process is somewhat expensive in that it is pretty time-consuming and needs quite a lot of data, it is preferable to use the standard model such as ResNet and VGGNet for the plaintext data with its pre-trained model parameters when the data privacy has to be preserved."
2111.05792,data,,,"Collecting data from real-world models is a costly operation. Thus, we determine the suitable length of a persona based on the following analysis, keeping data collection efﬁciency in our mind. Let N be the average number of URLs per persona, which we wish to determine. Let n be the fraction of personas for which we are able to collect some feedback (i.e., the trackers return no feedback for the rest). 10, 000 · n is the total number of personas we can collect feedback for and 10, 000 · N is the total number of URLs among all personas. We choose to select N such that we maximize n/N for the following reason: While longer personas with more URLs will likely trigger more feedback, computational overheads (e.g., CPU and memory) are also proportional to the total number of URLs. Thus, the most efﬁcient choice is to maximize the feedback we collect per URL, and n/N represents the number of personas with non-empty feedback per URL. The above procedure yields a value of N equal to 20, and we use the MC model described above to select the user URLs, and HARPO to select obfuscation URLs from the intent URL category, for a total of 20 URLs per user persona."

The theories have been validated on a number of datasets with the properties required by the conditions. The main limitations of this work lie in our two major assumptions: (1) there is no instantaneous causal inﬂuence between latent causal processes, and (2) causal inﬂuences do not change across regimes. Both of them may not be true for some speciﬁc types of temporal data. The existence of instantaneous relations distorts identiﬁability results, but the amount of these relations can be controlled by time resolution. While we do not establish theories under changing causal relations, we have demonstrated through experiments the possibilities of generalizing our identiﬁability results to changing dynamics. Extending our identiﬁability theories and framework to accommodate such properties is our future directions."

We, therefore, apply a dropout-like scheme to the input to simulate different sets of parents, similar as (Ke et al., 2019; Ivanov et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020; Brouillard et al., 2020). In that case, during training, we randomly set an input variable Xj to zero based on the probability of its corresponding edge Xj → min i (cid:12) φi Xi)). For categorical random variables Xi, we apply a softmax output where Mj ∼ activation for fφi, and for continuous ones, we use Normalizing Flows (Rezende & Mohamed, 2015). Graph ﬁtting uses the learned networks to score and compare different graphs on interventional data. N represents For parameterizing the edge probabilities, we use two sets of parameters: γ N the orientation of the edges. The likelihood of an the existence of edges in a graph, and θ σ(θij), with σ(...) being the sigmoid function and edge is determined by p(Xi → θji. The probability of the two orientations always sum to one. The beneﬁt of separating θij = the edge probabilities into two independent parameters γ and θ is that it gives us more control over the gradient updates. The existence of an (undirected) edge can usually be already learned from observational or arbitrary interventional data alone, excluding deterministic variables (Pearl, 2009). In contrast, the orientation can only be reliably detected from data for which an intervention is performed on its adjacent nodes, i.e., Xi or Xj for learning θij. While other interventions eventually provide information on the edge direction, e.g., intervening on a node Xk which is a child of Xi and a parent of Xj, we do not know the relation of Xk to Xi and Xj at this stage, as we are in the process of learning the structure. Despite having just one variable for the orientation, γij and γji are learned as two separate parameters. One reason is that on interventional data, an edge can improve the log-likelihood estimate in one direction, but not necessarily the other, leading to conﬂicting gradients."

Application of the voltage source converters can span from grid-interactive to household appliances, to versatile forms of electric vehicles [1]-[4]. The grid-interactive inverters enable high integration of renewable energy sources while also allowing for remote and dynamic control [5]-[10]. Many states in North America have integrated renewable energy resources in their power system planning for the future. Los Angles, California aims to achieve 100% of renewable electricity by 2045 along with aggressive electrification targets for buildings and vehicles [11]. Furthermore, California's total solar power generation is nearly 13%, with certain places generating as much as 25% [12]. In [13], it is reported that California has set a goal of generating 50% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. This increasing penetration of DGs allows for greater flexibility in power networks, where grid-interactive voltage source converters are the most important part of the modern power grid [14]-[17]. Likewise, the transportation system has already started moving toward electrification of technologies, i.e., more electrification controls, of replacement/modification of power-trains, replacement of combustion engines [18]-[19], etc. With modern powerelectronic technologies, the ultimate goal is to obtain high fuel efficiency, low maintenance costs. Therefore, this technological transformation can be achieved through the voltage source converters. Notice, this massive integration of voltage source converters in different aspects has brought up many challenges, which have been and are being solved through many different types of control scheme.

As seen in the above example, the wrapped optimizer also accepts the arguments like src_weights, communication_types, etc, to conﬁgure the communication to be executed at each iteration. These settings should be placed before the forward and backward computation because the communication may trigger during the forward propagation, the backward propagation, or the step function, depended on what kind of decentralized optimizer is used.

Meta-analysis of the properties of various mutual information feature networks could yield interesting insight into organic feature relationship behavior, as compared to null models of synthetically generated data. For example, the connectivity or graph spectra of real mutual information networks could be fundamentally different from feature networks of synthesized high-dimensional data, which may help data scientists to more easily identify cases of data fraud or imputation through examination of anomalous feature relationships [Pennisi, 2020]."

We have used L2 regularization of the regression coefﬁcients in the IT2 fuzzy c-means clustering for identiﬁcation of antecedent parameters. As demonstrated in the results section, the regularization helps our model against overﬁtting of the training data and increases the generalization on unseen data. In addition, an innovative scheme for optimizing the consequent parameters is also presented, wherein we do not perform type reduction of the type-1 weight sets prior for output estimation.

2007.13018,"data repository, data, dataset, data repos",,,"Abstract—Smartphones, wearables, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices produce a wealth of data that cannot be accumulated in a centralized repository for learning supervised models due to privacy, bandwidth limitations, and the prohibitive cost of annotations. Federated learning provides a compelling framework for learning models from decentralized data, but conventionally, it assumes the availability of labeled samples, whereas on-device data are generally either unlabeled or cannot be annotated readily through user interaction. To address these issues, we propose a self-supervised approach termed scalogramsignal correspondence learning based on wavelet transform to learn useful representations from unlabeled sensor inputs, such as electroencephalography, blood volume pulse, accelerometer, and WiFi channel state information. Our auxiliary task requires a deep temporal neural network to determine if a given pair of a signal and its complementary viewpoint (i.e., a scalogram generated with a wavelet transform) align with each other or not through optimizing a contrastive objective. We extensively assess the quality of learned features with our multi-view strategy on diverse public datasets, achieving strong performance in all domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of representations learned from an unlabeled input collection on downstream tasks with training a linear classiﬁer over pretrained network, usefulness in low-data regime, transfer learning, and cross-validation. Our methodology achieves competitive performance with fullysupervised networks, and it outperforms pre-training with autoencoders in both central and federated contexts. Notably, it improves the generalization in a semi-supervised setting as it reduces the volume of labeled data required through leveraging self-supervised learning."

2109.12907,dataset,,,"ABSTRACT The use of semantic technologies is gaining significant traction in science communication with a wide array of applications in disciplines including the life sciences, computer science, and the social sciences. Languages like RDF, OWL, and other formalisms based on formal logic are applied to make scientific knowledge accessible not only to human readers but also to automated systems. These approaches have mostly focused on the structure of scientific publications themselves, on the used scientific methods and equipment, or on the structure of the used datasets. The core claims or hypotheses of scientific work have only been covered in a shallow manner, such as by linking mentioned entities to established identifiers. In this research, we therefore want to find out whether we can use existing semantic formalisms to fully express the content of high-level scientific claims using formal semantics in a systematic way. Analyzing the main claims from a sample of scientific articles from all disciplines, we find that their semantics are more complex than what a straight-forward application of formalisms like RDF or OWL account for, but we managed to elicit a clear semantic pattern which we call the “super-pattern”. We show here how the instantiation of the five slots of this super-pattern leads to a strictly defined statement in higher-order logic. We successfully applied this super-pattern to an enlarged sample of scientific claims. We show that knowledge representation experts, when instructed to independently instantiate the super-pattern with given scientific claims, show a high degree of consistency and convergence given the complexity of the task and the subject. These results therefore open the door on the longer run for allowing researchers to express their high-level scientific findings in a manner they can be automatically interpreted. This in turn will allow for automated consistency checking, question answering, aggregation, and much more."
2104.13049,data,,,"The data generated by IoT devices has become progressively complex and nuanced, having a signiﬁcant impact on the reliable and efﬁcient transmission of data to the end user. It is, therefore, vital to ensure efﬁcient authentication and authorization between the various key enabling technologies. Fig. 2 depicts the sequence diagram for Blockchain-based authentication model. However, the convergence of BEoT can meet the standards for the better control of these types of authentication and authorization challenges. Byzantine tolerance consensus approaches are used to build a blockchain to ensure secure communication, authentication and end-to-end quality control. Resolution edge nodes and cache nodes are deployed at the edge, offering edge authentication, and boosting the hit ratio [6]. BEoT pays a lot of attention to facilitate mutual authentication for smart grid applications. The key agreement protocol is used at the edges where the edge server information is added to the blockchain, thus avoiding the leakage of the smart meter information. Using a smart contract allows only registered users to be connected to the public key, which helps to maintain the security and reliability of the smart grid network. Smart contract processing of key inputs can be used to reinforce the key revocation thus, preventing the need to prefer a trusted centre and preventing a design ﬂaw. In VEC, authenticating and authorizing information exchange is a challenge, as vehicle networks are dynamic. BEoT promises secure, efﬁcient transmission, trackable map paths that use a dynamic decentralized route hash chain and ensure a reliable system with low communication overhead. Blockchain technology integrated with the 5G RFID supply chain system has facilitated reliable computing and storage costs for EoT. The authentication mechanism uses the cryptographic hash function and bitwise XOR rotation, which consists of N blocks, and each block has a reader tag. The reader tag conﬁrm its authenticity followed by an acknowledgement of the requested data. Moreover, BEoT provides efﬁcient authentication for surveillance data sharing, an important service in industrial applications, as indicated in Fig. 3."

Data collected from social media are highly transliterated and contains errors thus, using these data for building a machine translation system for resource-poor languages causes errors. One of the primary forms that have a high chance of transliteration is cognates. Cognates are words from different languages derived from the same root. The concept cognate in NLP approaches are the words with similar orthography. Therefore, cognates have a high chance of transliteration. Though Machine translation has progressed a lot in recently, the method of dealing with transliteration problem has changed from a languageindependent manner to cognates prediction when translating between closely related languages, transliteration of cognates would help to improve the result for underresourced languages."

2105.05076,"dataset provided, data, data repos",,,"The first challenge is the free nature of the textual input. Design failures are reported by engineers with semistructured and unstructured formats. Free textual input may also include symbolic descriptions of elements, standard abbreviations, internal domain-specific abbreviations and, in some cases, two languages in the failure description. Those issues have to be handled, in order to prepare the available data for a search engine. Therefore, an extended text mining pipeline was developed and utilized for the preprocessing of this data. The second challenge comes from the multisource nature of the available data. Different sources of data provide important information [3], [4], regarding design and production processes. Those sources provide different data types, which accompany the main textual one, such as numerical values or structure-related data from the design project. In order to enable the user of accessing those different sources and their corresponding data types, this work solves the challenge with the utilization of knowledge graphs. As a network of interconnected data, a knowledge graph holds the potential to represents multiple data sources in one network. Therefore, different data sources and modalities can be intelligently fused together, in form of nodes, in the graph. This allows the search engine to access multiple modalities in one search command. Moreover, information that lies within the different sources also influences the intelligent construction of the graph itself, allowing more hidden links and relations between failure cases to be discovered, and thus, enhances the overall visibility of related lessons from previous design processes. Since the number of connections in a knowledge graph can be overwhelming, the third challenge in this work is related to the ordering and recommendation of most relevant failure cases to a certain current design. This is handled with a simple recommendation approach that utilizes both, the information gained from the text mining algorithm and the construction of the graph nodes. In this paper, we introduce a text mining pipeline to construct knowledge graphs from product-design-focused documents with regard to the specific type of a document. Furthermore, we propose a text mining-based concept for enhancing the construction of the created knowledge graphs through the introduction of a special type of connection-focused nodes in the graph. We call this node type the linking nodes, which are proposed to enhance the connectivity between multisource and multimodal data nodes within the graph, in order to improve its searchability. The proposed approach also highlights main limitations in the application environment, which are mainly related to the data quality. The amount of data, as well as the amount of non-meaningful tokens, authoring misconceptions and irregular misspellings can influence a mining algorithm, since it can limit the amount of useful information extracted from it. We follow mitigation procedures to counteract those limitations and we address their effect on the results in the result section. The first findings of this approach are reported in this paper as follows: in the second section of the paper, the background of the utilized algorithms is presented. In the third and fourth sections, the proposed methodology is described regarding text mining and knowledge graphs respectively. The experimental results are presented in the fifth section, and the sixth section concludes this work along with its future perspectives."

Then we utilize all N-grams equal or below this threshold, i.e. unigrams, bigrams and trigrams, in order to enhance the relation extraction between documents that contain those N-grams. However, unlike the TF-IDF based vectors, the N-grams approach does not represent the document’s topic based on the frequent and unique terms in it. Therefore, instead of including those N-grams in the document vectors, we utilize the structure of the constructed knowledge graph itself and introduce a new type of nodes to the graph that is mainly based on the N-gram approach. This maintains the document-specific vectors and allows the addition of new relations to the graph through the N-grams. We call those nodes the linking nodes; and they serve the goal of creating new connections between graph nodes, based on the mined possible patterns in the textual data. The following section presents a detailed description of this concept, along with the graph construction procedure."

For human facial emotion recognition, future work would be to improve emotion recognition for non-frontal head poses in presence of occlusions (i.e. emotion recognition in the wild). It should be made possible to recognize emotions during speech as well emotions with varying intensities. In the case of facial expression generation in robots, robots are capable of making the basic facial expressions. Few studies perform autonomous facial generation in robots. In the future, there could be studies comparing robotic facial expressions with the robot’s bodily expressions and also with a combination of facial and bodily expressions to see if there is any diﬀerence in recognizing these. Robots should be able to express their emotion with partial bodily or facial gestures while speaking.

If this is not the case, the sparsity regularizer will instead remove the edge between Xi and Xj preventing any false predictions among observed variables. For all other pairs of variables, at least one of the terms in Equation 8 converges to zero. Thus, we can detect latent confounders by checking whether the score function lc(Xi, Xj) is greater than a threshold hyperparameter τ (0.0, 1.0). We discuss possible guarantees in Appendix B, and experimentally verify this approach in Section 4.5."

We have an interesting ﬁnding that Failure-1 is due to the underuse of detailed features and Failure-2 is due to the underuse of visual contexts. To help the model learn a better trade-off, we introduce several Self-Regulation (SR) losses for training SS neural networks. By “self”, we mean that the losses are from the model per se without using any additional data or supervision. By applying the SR losses, the deep layer features are regulated by the shallow ones to preserve more details; meanwhile, shallow layer classiﬁcation logits are regulated by the deep ones to capture more semantics. We conduct extensive experiments on both weakly and fully supervised SS tasks, and the results show that our approach consistently surpasses the baselines. We also validate that SR losses are easy to implement in various state-of-the-art SS models, e.g., SPGNet [7] and OCRNet [62], incurring little computational overhead during training and none for testing1."

Then, the cache is ﬁlled with keys randomly sampled from this set. The number of entries in the cache varies between 12, 64, and 128 keys, i.e., 10%, 50%, and 100% of the total.

Scores for the all tokens are calculated from the TF and the IDF parts. Then, a certain threshold determines the choice of tokens that will represent each document in a vector format. Document vectors provide a unified approach for describing the content of documents from the multiple sources through the most representative terms in those documents. This approach has been chosen for its benefits in the construction of the knowledge graph, as well as the fusion of information extracted from different documentation process. This, in turn, supports the search functions to perform the same query on all data sources, since they have a coherent representation in the graph. However, document vectors are not the only type of information extracted from the available data sources. Each of the available data sources contains extra information based on the source nature itself. For example, a project description, as a documentation source, inherits the information about the structure of the project, which is utilized to create links between certain documents. Moreover, failure documentations that contain free textual descriptions of maintenance procedures, also contain patterns that appear when the same person writes the case description, or when the workers in the design department use certain terminology amongst each other. Those patterns can also be mined and utilized to extract relations between maintenance documents. In order to achieve this goal, we exploit an N-gram approach in the text mining algorithm.

Post-adaptation quality of the segmentation maps becomes much closer to the the supervised regime from a visual perspective.

In conclusion, while we observe signiﬁcant gains with respect to the Dice coefﬁcient which directly measures the segmentation accuracy, the improvement in surface distance is not as large as in methods maintaining access to the source domain during adaptation.

A triple channel image is a colored image in which GAF, RP and MTF images are considered as three orthogonal channels like three different colors in RGB image space. However, this three-channel image is not conventional way of converting a gray scale image to RGB, rather in this paper all three gray scale images are formed from raw ECG data with different statistical methods. Thus, a three-channel image in the presented work carries statistical dynamics of the ECG and therefore, is more informative.

2101.00522,data,,,"Both of the above mentioned approaches have been found helpful in various medical semantic segmentation applications [24, 73, 5, 26]. However, both UDA strategies require direct access to the source domain data to compute their corresponding loss functions. To relax this requirement, UDA has been recently explored in a source-free setting in order to address applications in which the source domain is not directly accessible [33, 57]. Both Kundu et al. [33] and Saltori et al. [57] target image classiﬁcation, and beneﬁt from generative adversarial learning to generate pseudo-data points that are similar to the source domain data in the absence of actual source samples. While both approaches are suitable for classiﬁcation problems, extending them to semantic segmentation of medical images is not trivial. First, training models that can generate realistic medical images is considerably more challenging due to importance of ﬁne details. Second, one may argue that if the generated images are too similar to the real images, the privacy of human subjects in the training data may still be compromised. Our work is based on using a dramatically different approach. We develop a source-free UDA algorithm that performs the distribution alignment of two domains in an embedding space by using an intermediate prototypical distribution to relax the need for source data."

2203.0248,"data, dataset",,,"The forecasting of low-level representations like landmarks or facial action units has been recently tackled with deep learning methods such as recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, and transformers. The usage of such deep and data-hungry models has been encouraged by the recent availability of large-scale multi-view datasets, often annotated in a semi-automatic way (Joo et al., 2019b; Palmero et al., 2022). The increasing accuracy of monocular and multi-view automated methods for face, pose, and hands estimation has contributed in reducing the annotation eﬀort. Still, the largest available datasets that provide thousands of hours of audiovisual material and feature the widest spectrum of behaviors do not provide such annotations (Carreira et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2019; Monfort et al., 2020; Grauman et al., 2021). In contrast, the automated methods for high-level representations recognition such as feedback responses or atomic action labels are not accurate enough to signiﬁcantly help in their annotation procedures. Consequently, such annotations are scarce, and are only available for small datasets, as shown in our survey. Accordingly, recent works have opted for classic methods such as SVM, AdaBoost, and simple recurrent neural networks, which have traditionally worked fairly well with small datasets. We expect future work on high-level behavior forecasting to also explore semi- and weakly-supervised approaches (Jain and Leekha, 2021)."

Particularly, when ground truths of the target images are not available, domain adaptation can train a target-speciﬁc model by utilizing the existing labeled images from other modalities. Most of the reported works mapped images of both the source and target domains into a common latent feature space, and then reduced their discrepancy either implicitly with adversarial training or explicitly by directly minimizing a discrepancy metric. In this work, we propose a new framework, where the latent features of both domains are driven towards a common and parameterized variational form, whose conditional distribution given the image is Gaussian. This is achieved by two networks based on variational autoencoders (VAEs) and a regularization for this variational approximation. Both of the VAEs, each for one domain, contain a segmentation module, where the source segmentation is trained in a supervised manner, while the target one is trained unsupervisedly. We validated the proposed domain adaptation method using two cardiac segmentation tasks, i.e., the cross-modality (CT and MR) whole heart segmentation and the cross-sequence cardiac MR segmentation. Results show that the proposed method achieved better accuracies compared to two state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrated good potential for cardiac segmentation. Furthermore, the proposed explicit regularization was shown to be eﬀective and eﬃcient in narrowing down the distribution gap between domains, which is useful for unsupervised domain adaptation.

Although this approach performs well, but due to the limitation of crisp membership values, its potential to handle the uncertainty in data is limited. Therefore, in order to successfully model the data uncertainty, a type-2 fuzzy logic was proposed, where membership values of each data points are themselves fuzzy.

Lately, many paraphrasing datasets have been introduced to be used for training and testing ML models for both paraphrase detection and generation. MSRP (Dolan and Brockett, 2005) contains 5801 sentence pairs, each labeled with a binary human judgment of paraphrase, created using heuristic extraction techniques along with an SVM-based classiﬁer. These pairs were annotated by humans, who found 67% of them to be semantically equivalent. The English portion of PPDB (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013) contains over 220M paraphrase pairs generated by meaning-preserving syntactic transformations. Paraphrase pairs in PPDB 2.0 (Pavlick et al., 2015) include ﬁne-grained entailment relations, word embedding similarities, and style annotations. TwitterPPDB (Lan et al., 2017) consists of 51,524 sentence pairs captured from Twitter by linking tweets through shared URLs.

2107.10483,data,,,"Assumption 2 A common assumption in causal structure learning is that the data distribution over all variables p(X) is Markovian and faithful with respect to the causal graph we are trying to model. This means that the graph represents the (conditional) independence relations between variables in the data, and (conditional) independence relations in the data reﬂect the edges in the graph. For ENCO, faithfulness is not strictly required. This is because we work with interventional data. Instead, we rely on the Markov property and assume that for all variables, the parent set pa(Xi) reﬂects the inputs to the causal generation mechanism of Xi. This allows us to also handle deterministic variables."

The conditional factorial properties have been injected using the reparameterization trick (Eq. 7) with the IN condition in causal transition prior and the enforcing of spatiotemporal independence of estimated residuals through contrastive learning. The nonstationary noises are modeled with ﬂow-based density estimators. We share the weights of the other modules (e.g., encoder, transition function, decoder, inference network, etc.) across nonstationary regimes while using separate ﬂow models to estimate the density of residuals and evaluate the prior scores in each regime. We also use componentwise ﬂow models so the learned residuals will not interact with each other in the estimation framework. Finally, in nonparametric processes, we warm-start the ﬂow models to generate standard Gaussian noise. In parametric processes, the ﬂow models are initialized to generate standard Laplacian noise. Note that the other assumed conditions in the two theorems, such as sufﬁcient variability and nonsingular state transitions, are data properties and do not need to be encoded as constraints in the estimation framework."

2107.10483,data,,,"γ-freezing stage For ENCO, one challenge of large graphs is that the orientation parameters θ are updated very sparsely. The gradients for θij require data from an intervention on one of its adjacent nodes Xi or Xj, which we evaluate less frequently with increasing N as we iterate over interventions on all N nodes. Hence, we require more iterations/epochs just for training the orientation parameters while wasting a lot of computational resources. To accelerate training of large graphs, we freeze γ in every second graph ﬁtting stage. Updating only θ allows us to use the same graph sample C ij Xj (Xj) since the log-likelihood estimate of Xj only needs to be for both evaluated for θij. With this gradient estimator, we experience that as little as 4 graph samples are sufﬁcient to obtain a reasonable gradient variance. Hence, it is possible to perform more gradient updates of θ in the same computation time. Note that this is estimator not efﬁcient when training γ as we require different C ij samples for every i. In experiments, we alternate the standard graph ﬁtting step with this pure θ-training stage. We want to emphasize that this approach can also be used for small graphs obtaining similar results as in Table 1. However, it is less needed because the orientation parameters are more frequently updated in the ﬁrst place. Such an approach is not possible for the baselines, SDI and DCDI, because they do not model the orientation as a separate variable."

First, two important hyperparameters (the architecture of the model and the L2- regularization value 𝜆) are selected for each setup using grid searches. The MLP and autoencoder architectures considered are those described in Section 4.1.4. The values considered for 𝜆 are 0, 10−5 and 10−4.

The model allowed for eﬀective generalization to large unlabeled ones, which were assumed to be from the same distributions with the labeled data. Furthermore, based on conditional variational autoencoder with Gaussian latent variables, Sohn et al. [38] proposed a stochastic neural network to make inference for structured output variables. They performed the deterministic inference by maximizing a generation network, which uses both the data and its corresponding latent features for prediction. Another important VAE work was from Walker et al. [39], where the authors constructed a VAE model to predict dense trajectories from pixels.

Notably, the SCN surpasses pre-training results with the autoencoder and on HHAR achieves better Fscore (82.7) than a supervised baseline (73.0). Particularly, we notice that the results obtained in a federated setting are close to those achieved with learning end-to-end models in a central setting, which hints towards the robustness of our approach in a federated environment. Similarly, when a linear classiﬁer is also trained in a federated setting, the performance of SCN is mainly consistent with the centralized classiﬁer, which is not the case for an autoencoder. Moreover, in Figure 4, we provide the t-SNE embedding of SCN on 1000 randomly selected instances from a test set of Sleep-EDF, WiFi-CSI, and HHAR.

For example, nonstationary variances are seen in EEG/MEG, natural video, and closely related to changes in volatility in ﬁnancial time series (Hyvarinen & Morioka, 2016). As we assume the transition functions fi are ﬁxed across regimes, the data that most likely satisfy the proposed condition is a collection of multiple trials/segments of data with slightly different temporal dynamics in between, where the differences can be well modeled by different noise distributions. For instance, in MEG data, temporal nonstationarity can be modeled by segmenting the measured data into different sessions (e.g., stimuli, rest, etc.) where the session index modulates the noise variance."

The previous studies by Ortega (2018a) have also found a similar pattern for Twitter, with Altmetric.com performing better than PlumX. One probable reason for such difference might be the fact that the two aggregators track articles by using different scholarly identifiers. Zahedi & Costas (2018b) have mentioned that the use of different scholarly identifiers could be one of the reasons for such variations. They have also reported that different handling policies of deleted tweets, protected tweets and suspended accounts by the two aggregators could be another reason for the differences observed. For example, PlumX removes all such tweets whereas Altmetric.com keep on counting the deleted ones. Thus, different handling of the tweet data appears to be the main reason for variations in coverage and values of tweets captured by the two aggregators."
2103.1163,dataset,,,"Abstract—Assisting end users to identify desired results from a large dataset is an important problem for multi-criteria decision making. To address this problem, top-k and skyline queries have been widely adopted, but they both have inherent drawbacks, i.e., the user either has to provide a speciﬁc utility function or faces many results. The k-regret minimization query is proposed, which integrates the merits of top-k and skyline queries. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, the k-regret minimization query is time consuming and the greedy framework is widely adopted. However, formal theoretical analysis of the greedy approaches for the quality of the returned results is still lacking. In this paper, we ﬁrst ﬁll this gap by conducting a nontrivial theoretical analysis of the approximation ratio of the returned results. To speed up query processing, a sampling-based method, STOCPRESGREED, is developed to reduce the evaluation cost. In addition, a theoretical analysis of the required sample size is conducted to bound the quality of the returned results. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted on both real and synthetic datasets to demonstrate the efﬁciency and effectiveness of the proposed methods."

Their approach is meant to support the representation of large heterogeneous and distributed datasets, which in turn helps in building decision support systems. Sinoara, Antunes and Rezende in [26] review the most utilized text mining approaches in semantic descriptions of data. In their study, the authors point out the majority of algorithms that exploit text classification and clustering in support of the graph construction or the matching and search within the constructed graph. They also highlight the role of domain experts in the utilization of textual data in knowledge graphs, since they can provide valuable information about the potential relations between the graph’s nodes. However, they find that domain experts are seldom integrated in the mining process, and they assign that to the complexity that is added to the system when considering interactive interfaces, which engage the expert user in the graph construction process. Moreover, the authors in [26] describe the visualization process in the context of knowledge graphs and text mining. Several approaches and tools are mentioned, which consider recommended methods of visualizing the relations within mined textual data, such as the Pinda tool [27], which adopts a hierarchical representation of texts using the k-means clustering algorithm for grouping the mining results. In [28], approaches are introduced to extract sub-knowledge-graphs as procedural representations, to partially exploit hierarchical information in semistructured texts. In this paper, we utilize the results from the state of the art and propose a new concept for a document aligned knowledge graph construction, in which text mining supports introducing a new type of nodes in the graph, called the linking nodes, in order to enhance the graph’s connectivity, multiple source data fusion and searchability."

Their inexpensive iterations generally come together with slow global convergence rate (mostly sublinear), leading to the necessity of carrying out a very high number of iterations before the iterates reach a neighborhood of a minimizer. In this work, we present a ﬁrst-order stochastic algorithm based on a combination of homotopy methods and SGD, called Homotopy-Stochastic Gradient Descent (H-SGD), which ﬁnds interesting connections with some proposed heuristics in the literature, e.g. optimization by Gaussian continuation, training by diffusion, mollifying networks. Under some mild assumptions on the problem structure, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm. Our analysis shows that, with a speciﬁcally designed scheme for the homotopy parameter, H-SGD enjoys a global linear rate of convergence to a neighborhood of a minimum while maintaining fast and inexpensive iterations. Experimental evaluations conﬁrm the theoretical results and show that H-SGD can outperform standard SGD."

Then, in Section 3, an extensive collection of datasets featuring audiovisual social interactions is presented. Datasets are classiﬁed according to the interaction scenario (dyadic, triadic, group, or several groups), task (conversational, collaborative, or competitive), and setting (participants are standing or seated). We also provide a summary table that allows the reader to easily compare the low- and high-level behavioral annotations provided as part of each dataset. Section 4 presents the most popular metrics for assessing the accuracy, diversity, and realism of the predicted behavior. In Section 5, we provide a discussion on general trends and current challenges, as well as possible future research directions for non-verbal social behavior forecasting. Finally, in Section 6, we review the ethical concerns regarding non-verbal social behavior forecasting and its real-world applications."

2004.14247,data,,,"Beyond the physical layer, new link and network layer strategies for ultra-directional THz links are needed. Indeed, the necessity for very highly directional antennas (or antenna arrays) simultaneously at the transmitter and at the receiver to close a link introduces many challenges and requires a revision of common channel access strategies, cell and user discovery, and even relaying and collaborative networks. For example, receiver-initiated channel access policies based on polling from the receiver, as opposed to transmitter-led channel contention, have been recently proposed [80]. Similarly, innovative strategies that leverage the full antenna radiation pattern to expedite the neighbor discovery process have been experimentally demonstrated [81]. All these aspects become more challenging for some of the speciﬁc use cases deﬁned in Section 2, for example, in the case of wireless backhaul, for which very long distances lead to very high gain directional antennas and, thus, ultra-narrow beamwidths, or smart rail mobility, where ultra-fast data-transfers can aid the intermittent connectivity in train-to-infrastructure scenarios.21"

In [21], short-time Fourier transform is used to convert ECG signal into timefrequency spectrograms that were used as input to CNN for arrhythmia classiﬁcation. Experimental results show that 2D-CNN achieved higher classiﬁcation accuracy than 1DCNN. In [36], ECG signal is converted into spectro-temporal images that were sent as an input to multiple dense convolutional neural network to capture both beat-to-beat and singlebeat information for analysis. Authors in [37] transformed heartbeat time intervals of ECG signals to images using wavelet transform. These images are used to train a six layer CNN for heartbeat classiﬁcation. In [38], Generative neural network is used to convert the raw 1D ECG signal data into a 2D image. These images are input to DenseNet which produces highly accurate classiﬁcation, with high sensitivity and speciﬁcity using 4 classes of heart beat detection. To distinguish abnormal ECG samples from normal, authors in [39] used pretrained CNNs such as AlexNet, VGG-16 and ResNet-18 on spectrograms obtained from ECG. Using a transfer learning approach, the highest accuracy of 83.82% is achieved by AlexNet. In [40], multi-lead ECG are treated as 2D matrices for input to a novel model called multileadCNN (ML-CNN) which employs sub two-dimensional (2D) convolutional layers and lead asymmetric pooling (LAP)"

2203.0248,"dataset provided, data",,,"We have discussed many applications for good where non-verbal social behavior forecasting might be valuable. Personalized pedagogical agents (Davis, 2018) that maximize learner’s attention and learning, empathetic assistive robots for hospital patients or dependent people (Andrist et al., 2015; Esterwood and Robert, 2021), and collaborative robots for industrial processes or even surgeries (Sexton et al., 2018) are few examples. However, each new technology comes with its own pitfalls and limitations. In fact, these algorithms may unintentionally hold important biases that lead to unfairness in the task being performed. For example, the implementation of behavior forecasting algorithms in security borders or migration controls might lead to undesired outcomes (McKendrick, 2019) interfering with human rights (Akhmetova and Harris, 2021). Furthermore, the interacting user should always be aware of the presence of such forecasting systems, the possible manipulations or persuasion techniques attached, and their ultimate goal. Unfortunately, providing the user with these descriptions is not always easy because most of the times such systems are neither transparent nor explainable. Therefore, the incorporation of speciﬁc techniques to promote such interpretability is of utmost importance in order to build trust with the user. On the other side, it is also important to consider the potential vulnerabilities that such systems may have and how users might exploit them driven by unethical purposes. This is especially important for assistive or collaborative robots, which often involve very sensitive scenarios. Finally, although data protection regulations vary across countries (Guzzo et al., 2015), data privacy and data protection must ensure informational self-determination and consensual use of the information that can be extracted with the methods presented herein. In this sense, frameworks such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR2) provide excellent safeguards for establishing ethical borders that should not be crossed."

First, we reveal scenarios in which algorithmic bias of inverse problem solvers may arise from off-label usage of open-access databases. We also analyze the effects of inverse crimes on complex high-dimensional learning systems via large-scale statistics. Secondly, we expose that CS, DictL and DL algorithms are all prone to this form of subtle bias. While recent studies identiﬁed stability issues of MRI reconstruction algorithms [5, 40], to the best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst study that identiﬁes a common vulnerability of canonical algorithms to such data-related bias.

Using crowdsourcing, we analyzed existing conversational datasets and annotated them with concepts, named entities, and personal entities. We found that while both concepts and named entities are useful for understanding the intent of user utterances, personal entities are mainly important in social chats. Further, we compared the performance of different established EL methods in a conversational setting and concluded that none of the examined methods can handle this problem effectively, falling short in providing both high recall and precision, as well as annotating concepts, named entities, and personal entity mentions. Our annotated conversational dataset (ConEL) and interface designs are made publicly available. These resources come with detailed instructions on the procedure of collecting the annotations, which can be used for further extension of the collection. Following the insights from this study, developing conversational entity linking methods and employing them in various types of conversational systems are obvious future directions."

An appropriate way to solve the false negative problem is to use supervised feature contrastive learning (SFCL) [16, 27]. Therefore, in this section, we mainly compare PCL with SFCL to verify whether PCL is necessary in domain adaptation tasks.

We train uncalibrated models employing conventional supervised machine learning technique, namely Support Vector Machines. Unfortunately, SVMs have a serious drawback. They are sensitive to imbalanced datasets, outliers and high multicollinearity among training samples, which could be a cause of preferencing one group over another. Thus, an additional calibration could be required for balancing a predictive relevance of models. As a technique for this balancing, we propose the Platt’s scaling. The achieved results were demonstrated on single-target models trained on datasets exported from the ExCAPE database. Unlike traditional used machine techniques, we focus on decreasing uncertainty employing deterministic solvers."

Indeed, some of our early testing have demonstrated that it is possible to run the JS classiﬁcation on a mobile phone browser using TensorFlow [16]. However, such an approach comes with its own limitations. For example, since the classiﬁcation engine has to operate at the client side, the content of a given JS ﬁle has to be downloaded ﬁrst by the browser, thus defying the data saving goals for unknown JS. Nevertheless, once the JS element is classiﬁed, the class label will be internally stored within the plugin cache to be used later. This means that a JS element would only need to be classiﬁed once, and the label will be known in subsequent requests to the same JS."

While RL is starting to be used for realworld applications (Bellemare et al., 2020), its adoption remains fairly limited. Standard RL techniques require repeated interaction with the environment. This is often too costly to implement practically, and running a poor policy could lead to disastrous outcomes (e.g., in power plants or healthcare decision-making systems). While controlling a large and/or complex real-world system can be costly and risky, data acquisition is often comparatively cheap. The goal of oﬄine RL is to evaluate and learn new policies based only on logged data, without any interaction with the environment."

2107.10483,data,,,"Next, we consider interventions on Xj. If under the sampled adjacency matrix Xi is conditionally independent of Xj, the difference in the log-likelihood estimates T (Xj, Xi) is zero. The variables can be independent if Xi is conditioned on variables that d-separate Xi and Xj in the true causal graph. For instance, having the children of Xi as parents of Xi creates this scenario. However, for this scenario to take place, one or more orientation parameters of parent-child or ancestor-descendant pairs must be incorrectly converged. In case of a parent-child pair Xi, Xk, Theorem B.1 shows that σ(θik) will converge to one removing any possibility of a reversed edge to be sampled. In case of an ancestor-descendant pair Xi, Xl, we can apply a recursive argument: as Xl d-separates Xi and Xj, Xl must come before Xj in the causal order. If for the gradient θil, we have a similar scenario with Xi being conditionally independent of Xj, the same argument applies. This can be recursively applied until no more variables except direct children of Xi can d-separate Xi and Xj. In that case, σ(θik) will converge to one, which leads to all other orientation parameters to converge to one as well. If Xi is not conditionally independent of Xj, we can rely back on the argumentation of Theorem B.1 Xj: as in the intervened causal graph, Xi and Xj are independent, any when we have an edge Xi → correlation learned from observational data can only lead to a worse log-likelihood estimate. In cases of colliders, we can rely on the recursive argument from before. Thus, under interventions on Xj, the gradient of θij must be smaller or equals to zero in expectation, i.e.increases θij."

1912.01136,"data, dataset",,,"The author of a more recent study [Robertson, 2013] classiﬁes into two macrocategories the methodologies for estimating body inertial parameters: regression equations models and geometric approximation models. The former technique is based on equations derived from cadaveric measurements, computed radiographs, or magnetic resonance imaging of a ﬁnite set of specimens. The author reveals the weakness of this approach since it extrapolates data from an average and has little accuracy for modelling a subject that falls outside the proportions of the initial dataset. The other approach consists of a collection of in situ measurements to be mapped into a geometric model to derive mass and properties from certain shape and density assumptions. Here too, the accuracy of the method depends on the complexity of the model and limited to the numbers of measurements. To this purpose, the Hatze model [Hatze, 1980] consists of a 17-segment geometrical model of the body but requires 242 anthropometric measurements, which would imply a relatively substantial amount of time from each subject."

2110.15667,data,,,"A few works have been done to investigated how to reduce the runtime complexity of QCNNs. In the ﬁrst family of works, a small number of qubits required for the quantum circuit is achieved by using classical data pre-processing techniques to reduce the dimension of the input features fed into the quantum (convolutional) layer. For instance, Pramanik et al. [35] employ principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the VGG-16 features for the quantum variational classiﬁer (VQC), while Hur et al. [36] adopt autoencoding (AutoEnc) for the dimensionality reduction. Nevertheless, the performance of the model trained in this way is likely to be compromised by the limited expressive power of the reduced features, as shown in [35]. The second family of works focus on how to efﬁciently encode classical data into quantum states. Schuld and Killoran [37] propose and implement the amplitude encoding for variational quantum circuits, which is explored further in [38] for Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI). This type of encoding method is efﬁcient in terms of required qubits for data encoding but it relies on too deep quantum circuits which are unpractical on NISQ devices. In a different direction, some recent researchers [26], [39], [40] propose angel encoding (also referred to as qubit encoding) and its variants (e.g. dense angel encoding) which use a constant quantum circuit depth for state preparation. This encoding scheme requires one qubit to encode one or a limited number of components of the input feature vector and thus is not efﬁcient for high-dimensional input features from a resource prospective. To trades off these two encoding methods mentioned above, Hur et al. [36] further develop a hybrid encoding approach which requires fewer number of qubits than the angel encoding and use shallower quantum circuit depth than the amplitude encoding. Moreover, Henderson et al. [22] employ a threshold based encoding technique to reduce the input-state space and made it possible to obtain the output feature map through a look-up table during the quantum convolution process without needing to execute the same quantum circuit repeatedly on image segments. This method is easy to implement, but it is infeasible on real quantum devices, as mentioned in [22]."

2203.0248,dataset,,,"Pose. The very ﬁrst attempt to forecast non-verbal body behavior in social interactions was carried out for robot learning of social aﬀordance (Shu et al., 2016). In their work, Shu et al. presented a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based algorithm that iteratively discovered latent subevents, important joints, and their functional grouping. Their method also considered past trajectories of objects to successfully predict the agent’s behavior while performing handshakes, high-ﬁves, or object handovers. Favored by the appearance of new and bigger datasets featuring social interactions (von Marcard et al., 2018; Andriluka et al., 2018; Joo et al., 2019a), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) quickly became the standard in human motion forecasting (Martinez et al., 2017; Hua et al., 2019; Honda et al., 2020). However, Honda et al. (2020) observed that recurrent models used for single human motion forecasting are not suitable for highly interactive situations like fencing. In their work, they presented a general framework that provided single human motion forecasting methods with the ability to model interpersonal dynamics. To do so, both encoder and decoder LSTMs received as input the previous skeleton (either observed or predicted) concatenated with the hidden state of the opponent in the previous timestep. As a result, the simultaneous behavior forecasting of both players encoded the interpersonal dynamics of the interaction, making the predicted movements more accurate and coherent in the context of competitive fencing. While previous approaches focused on scenarios strongly driven by interpersonal dynamics, Ahuja et al. (2019) emphasized the imbalance between intrapersonal and interpersonal dynamics in dyadic conversations, with considerably less instances from the later. They warned that, in such scenarios, interpersonal dynamics could end up being ignored. To mitigate this issue, they proposed a dyadic residual-attention model (DRAM) that smoothly transitioned between monadic- and dyadic-driven behavior generation. Results showed that their model successfully identiﬁed non-verbal social cues like head nod mirroring or torso pose switching and generated proper reactions. Hua et al. (2019) also supported the use of the partner’s cues but restricted it to the modeling of the listener’s behavior. In their approach, they presented a human-robot body gesture interaction system built similarly to the system of Chen et al. (2019) for facial gestures synthesis. Similarly, they also leveraged two specialized methods for the speaking (cospeech generator) and listening (behavior forecasting) phases of the interaction. In contrast to Chen et al.

The prominent approaches for learning from traditional input modalities include, colorization of grayscale images [34], predicting relative location of an image patch [25], audio-visual synchronization [2], temporal alignment in videos through cycle-consistency [35], word2vec (and other variants) [3], signal transformation prediction [8], contrastive predictive coding [1], and robotic imitation learning via time-contrastive networks [27].

1805.08801,data,,,"Abstract. Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases that affects tens of millions of Americans. PD is highly progressive and heterogeneous. Quite a few studies have been conducted in recent years on predictive or disease progression modeling of PD using clinical and biomarkers data. Neuroimaging, as another important information source for neurodegenerative disease, has also arisen considerable interests from the PD community. In this paper, we propose a deep learning method based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) for fusing multiple modalities of brain images in relationship prediction which is useful for distinguishing PD cases from controls. On Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort, our approach achieved 0.9537 ± 0.0587 AUC, compared with 0.6443 ± 0.0223 AUC achieved by traditional approaches such as PCA."

Items receiving a score of 1 can also be highlighted in the review and likely can be easily addressed in a revision. It also may not be possible to share code, which should be considered closely by the reviewer. In general, a guide for applying these metrics is as follows: <50 = manuscript will likely not achieve level necessary for publication even through revision and should therefore be rejected, 50-60 = manuscript needs major revision, >60 = manuscript needs minor or no revision to be considered suitable for publication. Note also that some sections may not be appropriate for some manuscripts. Use of N/A and reduction from the total possible score should be incorporated in such cases."

2106.07691,dataset,,,"next word according to its conditional probability distribution, introduces non-determinism in language generation. Fan et al. (2018) introduce top-k sampling, which ﬁlters k most likely next words, and the probability mass is redistributed among only those k words. Nucleus sampling (or top-p sampling) (Holtzman et al., 2020) reduces the options to the smallest possible set of words whose cumulative probability exceeds p, and the probability mass is redistributed among this set of words. Thus, the set of words changes dynamically according to the next word’s probability distribution. We use a combination of top-k and top-p sampling with k = 120 and p = 0.95 in the interest of lexical and syntactic diversity in the paraphrases. For each sentence in the source dataset (MSRP3 and TwitterPPDB for AP M T 5 respectively), we perform ﬁve iterations, in each of which, we generate ten sentences. If at least one of these ten sentences passes AP T , we continue to the next source sentence after recording all attempts and classifying them as M I or non-M I. If no sentence in a maximum of 50 attempts passes AP T , we record all attempts nonetheless, and move on to the next source sentence. For each increasing iteration for a particular source sentence, we increase k by 20, but we also reduce p by 0.05 to avoid vague guesses. Note the distribution of M I and non-M I in the source datasets does not matter because we use only the ﬁrst sentence from the sentence pair."
2107.07983,data,,,"These two new forms of data reuse result in much smaller on-chip buffer sizes, as the ﬂip-ﬂops required in the TPE are increasingly shared amongst a larger number of MAC units.

As a result, a larger TPE would also increase the energy efﬁciency, albeit at a marginally reduced clock frequency. Note that the outer-product TPE is more efﬁcient than the dot-product counterpart due to increased data reuse."
2106.07691,dataset,,,"The adversarial paradigm can be used to dive deeper into comparing how humans and SOTA language models understand sentence meaning, as we did with APT. Furthermore, automatic generation of adversarial datasets has much unrealized potential; e.g., different datasets, paraphrase generators, and training approaches can be used to generate future versions of APT 5 in order to produce AP T passing sentence pairs with lower lexical and syntactic similarities (as measured not only by BLEURT, but also by future state-of-the-art STS metrics).

The results showed that, the overlap of these sources across aggregators are comparatively low in numbers (Ortega, 2019a). As for example, Altmetric.com has a higher coverage for blog (37.8%) but only 7.8% of the publication set is commonly covered in the three aggregators. The coverage in one aggregator might be high for the same set of articles but the lower overlapping ratio shows that the sources covered in aggregators vary widely. Ortega (2020b) explored altmetric biases with respect to country, language and subjects with a dataset of 100,000 DOIs. Author has retrieved the sources which covered the randomly selected publication set and categorized them based on their regions, language and interest level. It was shown that, Altmetric.com is the most heterogeneous aggregator geographically and linguistically. However, PlumX had more coverage towards local news events, particularly for USA. Their conclusion served as evidence that English is the most prevailing language. From the same dataset, Ortega (2019b) extracted the blog and news links to verify the validity, coverage, and presence of the tracked blog mentions and news mentions of the scholarly articles. There were 51,000 news & blog links found in this extraction process, which were explored for their existence and it was found that almost one-third of the links are broken. This elaborate longitudinal study concluded that these mentions should be audited periodically as the aggregators are dependent on third-party providers."

For the DQN agent, we use an ε-greedy policy, that is, taking the greedy action of arg maxa Q(s, a) with a probability 1 ε and a random action otherwise where ε = 0.1. For the D4PG agent, we use the learned policy network with an additive Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 0.2.

2007.12442,data,,,"Re-Encryption TA. We begin by measuring the time required to re-encrypt a block of data inside or outside the TEE, one of MQT-TZ’s cornerstone operations. We include results for the hardware and the emulated environment using the powersave CPU governor, as it most closely matches the expected deployment settings. We breakdown these measures into four main components: the time it takes to retrieve each key (retrieve_dec_key, retriev_enc_key), and to use them (encrypt, decrypt). On the x-axis, we show results for different block sizes of data to re-encrypt, e.g., from 20 Bytes up to 20 kBytes. We compare the performance of MQT-TZ decrypting inside the REE (left-side vertical bars) or in the TEE (right-side bars). For encryption, we use AES in CBC mode with 32-Byte keys. Finally, we include results for the variants of the system that maintain the keys either in volatile memory as well as in secure storage, and the overall elapsed time (in ms) boxed. Figure 5 uses a stacked bar chart representation to present these results."
2007.12442,data,,,"Trusted Application. We rely on OP-TEE APIs to implement the payload re-encryption TA. Trusted applications implemented within this framework have two parts: (1) a host app that runs in the REE and acts as an entry point and bridge to the TEE, and (2) a trusted API in the TEE that exposes different functions. MQT-TZ intercepts all MQTT packets forwarded to the recipients, and feeds our host app with both client’s IDs and the encrypted data. Then, the payload re-encryption happens, using OP-TEE’s storage and cryptographic libraries. TRUSTZONE not only provides isolation between worlds, but also between different TAs. Hence, we use the same secure API to store new keys during the handshake. For key retrieval, we implement a new LRU cache in the TEE to store the most frequently used keys in the TA’s heap, while the remaining ones are evicted and ﬂushed in persistent secure storage [37]."

Then, a parent selection method (e.g., binary tournament selection) selects two parents, and crossover and mutation operations create a new oﬀspring. Finally, a newly generated oﬀspring is evaluated and compared with a randomly selected individual in the population. If the oﬀspring is better than the random member, the oﬀspring replaces it in the population."

We show that if there is a distance oracle for undirected n-vertex planar graphs with non-negative edge weights using s(n) space and with query time q(n), then there is a vertex-labeled distance oracle with ˜O(s(n))1 space and ˜O(q(n)) query time. Using the state-of-the-art distance oracle of Long and Pettie [12], our construction produces a vertex-labeled distance oracle using n1+o(1) space and query time ˜O(1) at one extreme, ˜O(n) space and no(1) query time at the other extreme, as well as such oracles for the full tradeoﬀ between space and query time obtained in their paper. This is the ﬁrst non-trivial exact vertex-labeled distance oracle for planar graphs and, to our knowledge, for any interesting graph class other than trees."

Counting difference was computed by taking the sum of the differences in metrics provided by two aggregators at the document level and dividing by the number of publications that have non zero altmetric events and occur in both aggregators. They concluded that different aggregators should be used for data from different platforms, such as PlumX for Mendeley reads and Altmetric.com for tweets, news & blogs. In another study, Ortega (2018b) has grouped different altmetrics into three groups: social media, usage, citations using principal component analysis (PCA). In this study data from Altmetric.com, Scopus and PlumX for a set of 3,793 articles published in 2013, was used. Considering that the earlier studies provided evidence that some specific aggregators perform better for some specific data sources; they collected different indicators from different aggregators. These included tweets, Facebook mentions, news, blogs etc. from Altmetric.com; citations from Scopus; Wikipedia mentions from CED; and views & Mendeley reads from PlumX. Results showed that instead of using a single metric, such as altmetric score, one should consider the relatedness of metrics and their impact across different disciplines for evaluating research. In another study, Ortega (2018c) examined the emergence and evolution of five altmetrics (download, views, tweets, readers, and blog mention) along with bibliometric citations from the publication date of a document. The study also investigated the evolution of the relationships among these metrics by analyzing 5,185 papers from PlumX on a month-tomonth basis.

At halftime of the thesis, the examiner was unsatisﬁed with the level of detail with respect to academic background and the repetitive, chronological state of the report. While we did not disagree with his assessment, we stuck to our priorities and focused on getting the artifact under control as a highest priority (G1) and to ﬁx the academic writing later (G7). This was risky, since a lack of strong background (here on theory of testing) might produce an invalid artifact. We took this risk, trusting that the artifact was not in conﬂict with established testing theory.

The very few packages that can run in a computer network were written for speciﬁc algorithms and network topologies. Adapting them to another project requires modifying lowerlevel communication.

2203.0248,dataset,,,"Finally, we want to raise awareness of what we consider one of the main bottlenecks of behavior forecasting: the evaluation metrics. An evaluation metric must always illustrate how well a method does for the target task. While this sentence may seem trivial when thinking of classic classiﬁcation or regression tasks, it is an important source of controversy in the behavior forecasting ﬁeld. For instance, the distance between the generated and the ground truth futures does not describe the coherence of the pose in all future steps, neither the realism of the movements. In fact, it does not even guarantee that a method with low error performs poorly, as the predictions may simply not match the ground truth, which is a sample of the multiple and equally plausible set of futures. Although one would conclude that a proper evaluation always contains a qualitative analysis, multiple behavioral dimensions may escape from human raters and therefore bias it. For instance, it is not trivial to build a qualitative analysis that also assesses the coherence of the predicted behavior with respect to the behavioral patterns speciﬁc to the subject, the context, or even the events from the mid- to long-term past. We hope that the recent appearance of behavior forecasting benchmarks and speciﬁc datasets will encourage the community to ﬁnd better-suited metrics and evaluation protocols that will boost the research progress in this ﬁeld."

Essentially, the condition says that the nonstationary regimes u must have a sufﬁciently complex and diverse effect on the transition distributions. In other words, if the underlying distributions are composed of relatively many domains of data, the condition generally holds true. For instance, in the linear Auto-Regressive (AR) model with Gaussian innovations where only the noise variance changes, the condition reduces to the statement in (Matsuoka et al., 1995) that the variance of each noise term ﬂuctuates somewhat independently of each other in different nonstationary regimes. Then the condition is easily attained if the variance vector of noise terms in any regime is not a linear combination of variance vectors of noise terms in other regimes."

We therefore measured far-sightedness by the proportion of such far-sighted planning operations among the ﬁrst k planning operations, where k denotes the number of pieces of information that are available about the most-longterm consequences. We call this measure the far-sightedness quotient (FSQ). For example, consider a Roadtrip trial that includes two possible ﬁnal destinations: Choosing these two ﬁnal destinations in the ﬁrst 2 clicks results in an FSQ of 1. Choosing one ﬁnal destination and one stopover in the ﬁrst two clicks results in an FSQ of 0.5.

These do not necessarily map to numeric or string data types. The unique response count threshold between discrete and continuous features is a parameter that can be adjusted in the parameter ﬁle, or in the command line argument ﬂags. If the number of unique responses for a feature is less than the speciﬁed threshold, the feature is treated as discrete. Thus, a numeric feature with unique numeric responses {1,2,3} would be treated as a discrete (categorical) value by default, and its corresponding charts would either be heatmaps or ridgeline plots, depending on whether it was paired with a discrete or continuous feature, respectively. Features are also classiﬁed as discrete when the number of unique responses exceeds the threshold in the event that the unique feature responses cannot be converted to numeric values (e.g. {‘AU’,‘EU’,‘UK’...} when all country codes are present in the data set). This may produce heatmaps with many cells, or ridgeline plots with many rows, in charts comparing this feature to another discrete or continuous feature, respectively."

Also, the bSSFP CMR covers more similar part of the heart with the LGE images and contains more slices than T2, we therefore chose bSSFP images as the source domain. The organizers provided 45 bSSFP CMR images with 35 of them having gold standard segmentation of RV, LV and MYO.

2109.08237,"data, data available",,,"This work offers insights into subtle mechanisms that lead to biased performance of modern reconstruction algorithms. Our main observation is that such bias stems from the unintentional coupling of hidden data processing pipelines with later retrospective-subsampling experiments; the data processing implicitly improves the inverse problem conditioning, and the retrospective subsampling enables the algorithms to beneﬁt from that. This process may appear in different forms. In subtle data crime I, the zero-padding concentrates the ""true"" k-space data to the center, and when VD sampling is later applied, those data are densely sampled; the increased amount of ""true"" data that becomes available to the algorithm makes the inverse problem easier to solve, hence algorithms tend to exhibit misleadingly-good results. In subtle data crime II, the JPEG compression reduces the data entropy, i.e. it increases their sparsity and yields a more compact representation in a sparsifying transform domain. Modern reconstruction algorithms leverage sparsity priors or learn the compact representation from training data [6, 36, 43, 44]; therefore, they beneﬁt from the compression and yield biased results."
2105.05076,data,,,"Knowledge graphs, or knowledge maps, are graphical representations of a knowledge base. Whether ontologies or other semantic representations that are based on relations between graph entities, those networks have been a robust approach utilized for knowledge representation, information extraction and decision support.  Semantic knowledge representations can enhance or be enhanced by other technologies related to data preparation, such as text mining, information extraction, deep learning and natural language processing [21]. In their summary on the utilization of knowledge graphs with text mining, authors in [21] highlight the rising role of knowledge graphs in text-centric retrieval, especially for search system applications. Their review focuses on linking graph entities, the retrieval of those entities and the role of text mining in the retrieval process. In this context, an entity of a knowledge graph is one entry in this graph, or a node, which has its attributes and relations to other nodes/entities in the graph. Since each node in the graph has normally a textual form of information attached to it, such as annotations, properties or names, linking graph nodes can then be defined as the process of identifying the relevance of this textual content between two nodes in the graph. This can then be expressed explicitly as an additional relation between them. Retrieving graph nodes, on the other hand, refers to the process of identifying and extracting nodes in the graph, which are related to a certain query of the user. In other words, it is determining the relevance of a node, based on a relevance measure between the text of a search term and the textual content of the nodes in the graph. Since, in a text extraction-based graph generation, graph nodes are representing extracted text from text documents, retrieval models are required, which are called retrieval models. A standard retrieval model combines heterogeneous and semi-structured information about the node, e.g. its attributes, into one representation that can be static, as in [22], or dynamic such as in [23]. Textual data can enhance the node retrieval through supporting the matching process between the node attributes, on one side, and the textual query on the other side. This can be accomplished on a level that uses keywords or on a complex features level, where machine learning algorithms can play an effective role in learning the matching functions [24].  Knowledge graphs can also utilize other data mining methods to enhance the search and matching tasks.

2004.14247,data,,,"At mmWave frequencies and above, there is a need for dense network deployments to mitigate the reduced coverage at these bands due to constraints in the propagation environment and hardware limitations in the transceivers. Such dense deployments make backhauling/fronthauling challenging at these bands, in particular, it is expensive and cumbersome to roll out ﬁber links to all APs. However, the presence of very wide bandwidths at these carrier frequencies makes it possible to include the wireless backhaul/fronthaul in the same spectrum as the wireless access. For this reason, integrated access and backhaul (IAB) network conﬁgurations seem promising, where a few (potentially, ﬁber-connected) APs provide other APs as well as the mobile devices inside their cell area with wireless backhaul and access connections, respectively [13, 54]. IAB networks are diﬀerent from conventional relay networks, because the information load changes in diﬀerent hops. Particularly, as the number of mobile devices per hop increases, the APs need to transfer an aggregated data of multiple mobile devices accumulated from the previous hops. In addition, the interference on the links will depend on the information load. Some early work has been performed. It was demonstrated in [13, Sec. 7.6] how massive MIMO can be used for backhaul to small cells. In this framework, the access and backhaul are separated in space. In [55], an alternative framework for an IAB-enabled cellular network was developed and used to characterize the downlink rate coverage probability. In this framework, the bandwidth was divided between access and backhaul, either statistically or based on the dynamic network load.

Annotating medical images is also expensive, as annotation can be performed only by physicians, who undergo years of training to obtain domain expertise. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is a learning setting aimed at reducing domain gap without data annotation in the target domain. The goal is to adapt a source-trained model for improved generalization in the target domain using solely unannotated data [20, 68, 56, 71]. The core idea in UDA is to achieve knowledge transfer from the source domain to the target domain by aligning the latent features of the two domains in an embedding space. This idea has been implemented either using adversarial learning [23, 13, 67, 4], directly minimizing the distance of distributions of the latent features with respect to a probability metric [8, 62, 36], or a combination of the two [11, 58]."

From the scatterplot we can diﬀerentiate three main clusters, the ﬁrst is composed by the planes in the direct cascade regime, while the other two are made of planes from simulations around or above the transition. Inside these three main clusters it is not possible to distinguish any speciﬁc Ωi. Furthermore, moments amplitude is not a monotonic function of the Ωi. The right panel of Fig. 7 shows the joint-likelihood of the two observables introduce above, mean energy and mean gradients.

2104.13049,"data, database",,,"computational overhead while participating in the blockchain network as encrypting the blocks is mandatory. In contrast, the decentralized blockchain consumes more bandwidth and more storage. Real-time video streaming which consumes larger bandwidth is a mandated need for most of the applications in the smart city environment. Usually, the processing of data at blocks will consume more computational resources when the ledger is accumulated with more information. As such, side chains can be used with the blocks segregating the secondary data from the central ledger and storing them in the side chains [12]. Though the mining process in PoW consensus blockchains consumes more energy [13] as it is energyintensive by design and has no signiﬁcant impact when the blockchain scales up. Therefore, a lightweight blockchain with less energy consuming cryptocurrencies should be designed. Intel’s recent work proves proof-of-the-elapsed-time (PoET) to leverage the trusted computing by enforcing random waiting times in block creation. The computational resource utilization in data processing between the cloud and the end devices can be accompanied by edge servers to guarantee the lowlatency response. This, in turn, makes the processing faster and ensures the availability of computational resources. The limited storage capacity at the edge cannot withstand the dynamic user demand, so the transactions at the edge can be managed using blockchains. Furthermore, skyline queries that search only the related data instead of the whole database can be used for retrieving data information from massive data accumulation. Thus, the effective resource utilization in the scalable BEoT environments alleviates the storage overheads involved in processing enormous data accumulation. Also, it requires an authorized load provisioning system for sustainable services."

Particularly, on the right atrium and right ventricle, SIFA had over 20% Dice score deﬁcit. SIFA largely depends on the quality of the fake target image translated from the source data [11]. Since the textures of MR images are more complex than that of the CT images, translating CT to MR with the same semantic contents is more diﬃcult than the other way around. Hence, in their work [11] SIFA obtained much better accuracies on CT images when MR images were used as the source domain. For CFDnet, as it failed in the segmentation of all structures, we did not report the results in the table. This indicates that the CF distance could be challenged in domain adaptation, when the structures to be segmented are over complex. In addition, the average Dice score of the eleven supervised methods reported in [44] ranged in (0.674, 0.874) with mean value as 0.824. We provide this result here solely for reference."

They combined latent features from all modalities into a single fused representation, which can be transformed into any target modality with a decoder. Tulder et al.

They utilized feature normalization and modality dropout techniques to improve the crossmodality classiﬁcation accuracy. The core idea in these two works was to force the latent features from paired data to be similar. To learn the models, they processed the training data pairwisely, which does not need to consider the difference of data distributions from modalities. Moreover, Shi et al.

More precisely, if the parameter set Θ is a topological space and if Σ(θ) is continuous in θ and if we ﬁnd θ ∈ Θ such that θ is close to θ0, then the matrices of Σ(θ) = ( ˆA, ˆK, ˆC) will be close to Σ(θ0) = (A0, K0, C0).

2110.15667,dataset,,,"• QDCNN Model. We employ the architecture of the most basic convolution-inspired hybrid quantumclassical neural network. Our QDCNN model consists of one QDC layer with one ﬁlter and one fullyconnected layer with 10 neurons. The kernel size and stride for the QDC layer is selected as 2 × 2 and 2 respectively without speciﬁcation. The quantum circuit ansatz of the QDC layer is designed as below. The 1 variable/qubit encoding scheme is adopted to encode the input image. Speciﬁcally, 2 × 2 pixels are encoded into a 4-qubit state using RY rotation gates. Note that, these 2 × 2 pixels are not adjacent to each other in the input image, due to the quantum dilated convolution. The resulting 4-qubit state is further transformed by a following random parameterized quantum circuit which might creates the entanglement. The decoding method follows the same spirit of [52], in which each expectation value is mapped to a different channel of a single output pixel. Consequently, even though there is only one ﬁlter, the quantum layer can transform the input 2-D image into four feature maps. This type of quantum layer might beneﬁt the model performance as it allows for correlation among channels of the output feature maps. In both cases of MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, the QDC layer extracts from the 28 × 28 input image a feature tensor of size 13 × 13 × 4, which is then transformed to 10 output probabilities by the fully-connected layer with softmax activation. To evaluate how the dilation rate impacts the model performance, we consider two QDCNN models with dilation rate r = 2 and r = 3. We refer to these two models as QDCNN r2 and QDCNN r3 respectively for the rest of the paper."

Therefore, we have developed a methodology for assessing the state of the software development practices for a given research software domain. The methodology is applied to one domain at a time in recognition that software development in diﬀerent domains is likely to have adopted diﬀerent best practices. Moreover, providing a means to measure diﬀerent domains facilitates comparison of development practices between domains. For each domain we wish to answer questions such as: i) What artifacts (documents, code, test cases, etc.) are present? ii) What tools are used? iii) What principles, process and methodologies are used? iv) What are the pain points for developers? v) What actions are used to improve qualities like maintainability and reproducibility? To answer these questions, our methodology prescribes the following steps: i) Identify the domain; ii) Identify a list of candidate software packages; iii) Filter the list to a length of about 30 packages; iv) Gather source code and documentation for each package; v) Collect repository related data on each software package, like number of stars, number of open issues, number of lines of code; vi) Fill in the measurement template (the template consists of 108 questions to assess 9 qualities (including the qualities of installability, usability and visibility)); vii) Interview developers (the interview consists of 20 questions and takes about an hour); viii) Rank the software using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP); and, ix) Analyze the data to answer the questions posed above.

2106.08752,dataset,,,"For experiments, we designed a U-net [48] based network for multi-scale segmentation. The details of the network structure are presented in the Supplementary Material. We adopted Adam optimizer [49] for the training with batch size of 10. The initial learning rate was set to be 10−4, and was decreased with a stepped decay rate of 0.9 every 150 iterations. We empirically valued the tradeoﬀ parameters in (14). To achieve this, we validated VarDA on MS-CMRSeg dataset with α1 = 1, α2 = 10−1, 100, 101, α3 = 100, 10−1, 10−2, 10−3, 10−4, 10−5 , 10−6. We found that the setting of α2 = 1 and α3 = 10−2 was a suitable choice, and we kept this parameter setting in the following experiments. We further plotted the loss terms of VarDA during training in Fig.3. As the segmentation loss from source domain contributed largely to the model optimization, we separated the loss of the source VAE, i.e., (cid:101)LS, into two parts, including the segmentation loss (denoted by (cid:101)Lseg) and the remaining loss (denoted by (cid:101)LS/seg). As shown in Fig.3, the regularization term (cid:101)D dropped fast and converged quickly. Moreover, (cid:101)LS/seg and its counterpart in target domain, i.e., (cid:101)LT , even converged in the ﬁrst 100 iterations."

CNNs are vulnerable in the area of biomedical image segmentation because of distributional gap between two source and target domains with different data modalities which leads to domain shift. Domain shift makes data annotations in new modalities necessary because models must be retrained from scratch. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is proposed to adapt a model to new modalities using solely unlabeled target domain data. Common UDA algorithms require access to data points in the source domain which may not be feasible in medical imaging due to privacy concerns. In this work, we develop an algorithm for UDA in a privacy-constrained setting, where the source domain data is inaccessible. Our idea is based on encoding the information from the source samples into a prototypical distribution that is used as an intermediate distribution for aligning the target domain distribution with the source domain distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing it to state-ofthe-art medical image semantic segmentation approaches on two medical image semantic segmentation datasets."

We then calibrated, trained and tested the algorithms on each processed dataset separately. This ensured that each algorithm was evaluated using instance-optimal parameters; it therefore mitigated bias related to hyperparameter tuning. Secondly, we applied the three algorithms to identical datasets; their results are therefore comparable. Finally, we generated sampling masks on-the-ﬂy, i.e. a different random mask was generated for each k-space example during the training and test sessions. This technique enables generating a large number of sampling masks while maintaining their statistics, hence it prevents over-ﬁtting to any particular sampling mask."

These equivalence classes represent potential dynamics of how the conjunctions change their truth values so that the full DNF formula was satisﬁed. To ﬁnd a small subset of equivalences classes that is suﬃcient to describe all of the trajectories, each trajectory, treated as a sequence of conjunctions of the DNF formula, is assigned to one equivalence class.

First LASSO method is used for dimension reduction of S&P500, then post selection inference method used to see which predictors are more eﬀective and less uncertain for their eﬀect on the index and they are called principal components in the context of principal component analysis(PCA). There are many methods to solve the lasso problem as described in Hastie et al. (2015). Benidis et al. (2018) uses majorization minimization (MM) but the present paper uses coordinate descent although the choice of the solver is not the issue for the current paper. Once the LASSO algorithm or any other linear regression method is implemented, the next important step is to see which of these coeﬃcients are more certain in the framework of statistical inference. Exact post-selection inference explained in Jason et al. (2016) is one of the relative recent ideas for inference which unlike traditional approach, inference is done after selection by data. The approach that is used in present paper for post-selection inference(POSI) is called Exact POSI and is described in Jason et al. (2016). There are other methods for POSI such as data splitting[Cox (1975)] which uses half of data for inference and the other half for selection. Although many statisticians use this method, but it reduces the statistical power since half of data is neglected and inferences are only valid for data that is used in selection.

2110.05428,data,,,"In this paper, we focus on the scenario where the observed temporal variables xt do not have direct causal edges but are generated by latent processes or confounders zt that have time-delayed causal relations in between. That is, the observed data xt are unknown nonlinear (but invertible) mixtures of the underlying sources: xt = g(zt). Our ﬁrst goal is hence to understand under what conditions the latent temporally causal processes can be identiﬁed. Inspired by real situations, we consider both a nonparametric, nonstationary setting and a parametric setting for the latent processes. In the nonparametric setting, the generating process of each latent causal factor zit is characterized by nonparametric assignment zit = fi(Pa(zit), (cid:15)it), in which the parents of zit (i.e., the set of latent factors that directly cause zit) together with noise term (cid:15)it ∼ p(cid:15) (where p(cid:15) denotes the distribution of (cid:15)it) generate zit via unknown nonparametric function fi with some time delay. In the parametric setting, the time-delayed causal inﬂuences among latent factors follow a linear form. In both settings, we establish the identiﬁability of the latent factors and their causal inﬂuences, rendering them recoverable from the observed data."

However, we ﬁnd that these 2D transformations do not take into account the object’s height, and with this neglection features along the vertical direction of same object are likely not projected onto the same ground plane point, leading to impure ground-plane features. To solve this problem, we propose VFA, voxelized 3D feature aggregation, for feature transformation and aggregation in multi-view detection. Speciﬁcally, we voxelize the 3D space, project the voxels onto each camera view, and associate 2D features with these projected voxels. This allows us to identify and then aggregate 2D features along the same vertical line, alleviating projection distortions to a large extent. Additionally, because different kinds of objects (human vs. cattle) have different shapes on the ground plane, we introduce the oriented Gaussian encoding to match such shapes, leading to increased accuracy and efﬁciency.

In addition to efﬁcient compression of Lena image, ZT and interlacing-ZT have faster implementations than DCT and FWHT as shown in Fig. 10a. The proposed algorithms were also tested using the Elaine.gif image and the compression ratio and running time are depicted in Figs. 9b and 10b respectively. Again, we observed that ZT and interlacing-ZT outperform their counterparts in both compressing capabilities and speed of implementation. In the next set of experiments, we benchmark the proposed schemes with DCT and FWHT in terms of CR and running time using the cameraman.png image data. It was observed in Figs. 9c and 10c that the performances of ZT and interlacing-ZT outweighs those of DCT and FWHT. For couple.png image data, we again observe that ZT and interlacing-ZT are superior to both DCT and FWHT in term of CR for most of the block sizes considered as shown in Figs. 9d. In fact, a close scrutiny of the results shows that the performance is more pronounced when the block size is 64. In addition to the poor compressing capability, implementing DCT and FWHT are more expensive in terms of running time than the ZT-based compression paradigms as shown in Fig. 10d. In Tables 1 and 2, we report the average length of the codewords and average entropy for Dataset 1 in Fig. 6 for all the four methods considered. Each image in Dataset 1 is transformed using DCT, FHWT, Zipper, and interlacing-Zipper then encoded using Huffman coding scheme. Entropy and average length of the codewords were recorded and averaged over all the images in Dataset 1. The most efﬁcient of the four methods is highlighted in bold fonts. Our observations for all the experiments reported in Tables 1 and 2 are that average length of the codeword decreases as the entropy decreases for all the four methods, and also the value of entropy is very close to the average codeword length. Closer look at each of the compression method reveals that the discrepancy between the average length of the codeword and the entropy is smallest for ZT-based algorithms compared to DCT and FWHT-based methods. In addition, the average length for zipper-based transforms is less than those of DCT and FWHT for almost all the block sizes tested. It is also remarked that both ZT and interlacing-ZT yield similar results which might indicate robustness of the proposed approach."

2105.10148,dataset,,,"Most algorithms provide an accurate estimate of the policy value on this dataset, except Deep GMM, Deep IV, and KIV. We observe experimentally that the training process of Deep GMM is very unstable compared the other two adversarial approaches (AGMM and ASEM). Figure 11 shows a typical trajectory of the training loss and the estimated policy value along the training process. We suspect it is due to the ˜θ in the regularization term. Deep IV fails with both a use of the optimal weighting large mean absolute error and variance. In particular, in the Catch environment, the generative model completely fails to predict the next state. This illustrates the challenge of modeling a moderately-high dimensional state space (50-dimensions) using a simple feed-forward network to predict the parameters of a mixture of Gaussian generative model as proposed in Hartford et al. (2017b). We expect the performance to improve with a more sophisticated generative model as evidenced by recent model-based OPE work in Zhang et al. (2021). KIV fails in the Cartpole and Mountain Car environments with a large error too. This is in agreement with the observation by Xu et al.

2102.0617,data,,,"Building upon the analysis which was presented in the previous section, we introduce a new heuristic for estimating the minimum, average, and maximum T RT per data point gathered through proﬁling runs. Referring to Figure 1, the T RT is modeled as a decreasing geometric sequence where the 1st term is composed of the time periods vii through x multiplied by a common ratio U . The ﬁrst time period E is directly related to the checkpoint interval (CI) conﬁguration. The CI is deﬁned as the frequency with which the checkpoint process is initiated and is measured in milliseconds. Since we cannot predict exactly when the failure will occur between checkpoints, we can take a best, average, and worst case estimate. Therefore, zero in the best case scenario, the length of the CI divided by two in the average case, and the full length of the CI in the worst case. The second time period T is based on the heartbeat timeout conﬁguration variable which determines how long the system will wait until a node is timed out. In order to calculate the common ratio, a measure of the processing capacity utilization is required. We know that the system will use the maximum processing capacity of the system on top of what is already being utilized to catch-up after a failure has occurred. Therefore, knowing the average rate at which messages are processed (Iavg) and the maximum rate at which the system is capable of processing (Imax) can be combined to formulate the processing capacity utilization as a percentage (U) as seen in Equation 1."

To realize this function, this project has two steps to consider: (1) Find those relatively dark images. (2) Enhance the brightness of these images. For the first step, this project can calculate the proportion of pixels with lower brightness to all pixels. After several attempts, the project’s researchers believe that pixels with grayscale values below 50 can be regarded as the “darker pixels”. And if the proportion of darker pixels in an image is greater than 0.3, then it can be considered that this image needs a certain degree of brightness enhancement. The second step can be realized based on an open-source project on Github[7] which is an implement of the KinD network the method section has introduced. By the pretrained checkpoints, the brightness of images can be enhanced.  Two images with a dark pixel ratio of 0.3 and 0.6 is shown in Figure4(a) and the enhanced results of them are shown in Figure4(b)."

2007.13018,"publicly available, data, dataset",,,"In this paper, we propose a self-supervised method for learning representations from unlabeled multi-sensor input data, which is typical in the IoT setting. Our method utilizes wavelet transform to generate a complementary view of the input (i.e., a scalogram) to deﬁne an auxiliary task of scalogram-signal correspondence. This procedure is speciﬁcally designed to work in federated learning setting to allow training networks with widely distributed and unannotated data as the labels can be readily extracted from the data without human-in-the-loop. We show the efﬁcacy of the developed technique on several publicly available datasets involving diverse sensory streams, such as electroencephalogram, blood volume pulse, and IMUs. Particularly, we evaluate the quality of learned features with a linear classiﬁer on an end-task and compare the performance with a fully-supervised network and pre-training with an autoencoder in both federated and central settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate an improved generalization in the low-data regime with self-supervision, i.e., when few labeled instances are used for ﬁne-tuning network on the desired end-task. Our generic self-supervised approach can be used efﬁciently to learn general-purpose deep feature extractors entirely ondevice without the need to transmit the actual data to the server. In future work, we plan to combine self-supervision with architecture search on larger datasets and evaluate our method in a non-IID setting for federated learning. Another avenue of future research is to explore the effectiveness of self-supervised pre-training for adversarial robustness in a federated setting."

When a model and an instance respect all the implicit assumptions by the modeller we say that it is a valid problem. As an example, some implicit assumptions by the modeller in the floor-tile domain (Figure 2) are that in the initial state each robot must be at exactly one tile, or that any given cell can only have one unique cell on top of it. Moreover, in the IPC-14 published instances, the tiles’ structure (represented by up, down, right and left) always forms a square grid. In the automated planning community, sometimes when a problem is released, a Python or Java program is included to generate instances automatically. The validity properties of the problem are normally hard-coded in those programs, and therefore appear implicitly in the generated problem instances."

In FL, the algorithm training is performed in a decentralized manner by diﬀerent nodes, or clients, that use local data. In this scenario, each decentralized node trains an individual model using its own data and shares the model parameters (instead of the data) with the rest. The exchange of the model parameters and their aggregation to create a unique and global model can be performed through a central entity, called server, or following a peer-to-peer approach [8]. After several iterations, each client has a global model obtained as an aggregation of the individual model of each client.

2011.09069,data,,,"This article, therefore, attempts to revisit the question of coverage variation, differences in altmetric scores and correlations in values provided by the two aggregators by analysing a very large sample of scholarly articles. We analysed a set of 1,785,149 publication records (17 times higher than the largest data sample used earlier), which constitutes the complete publication record for the world for the year 2016 indexed in Web of Science. The data for the year 2016 was taken for the reasons of stability of bibliometric records and also for availability of longer period (2016 to 2019) for the altmetric events to accrue. Given that a recent study (Karmakar, Banshal & Singh, 2021) has observed that altmetric events accrue for a longer time period, it was important to take altmetric data for a longer period for an accurate analysis of the differences in coverage and altmetric values of the two aggregators. Further, since the publication records comprised of the whole of Web of Science publication records for the world for a complete year, they represented different geographies, publication types, subjects, and publishers. Therefore, the study could also compare differences in coverage and altmetric values obtained from the two aggregators across different document types, subjects and publishers.

All three SMO implementations behave very similarly, with the dense implementation of LIBSVM having a slight advantage over its sparse implementation. ThunderSVM performs better than LIBSVM in the medium size range, while in the extremes the LIBSVM variants are faster. However, all SMO implementations exhibit a steeper slope, compared to the LSSVM method used in PLSSVM. We out-scale both LIBSVM variants, starting with 211 data points. For 214 data points in 210 dimensions we need approximately 56.2 s to train the PLSSVM while LIBSVM already needs 7.0 min (dense) re (a) CPU runtimes relative to the number of data points with 210 features."

Since BCGs are non-Euclidean, it is not straightforward to use a standard convolution that has impressive performances on the grid. Additionally, multi-view graph fusion methods [37] allow us to explore various aspects of the given data. Our non-parametric view pooling is promising in practice. Furthermore, the pairwise learning strategies can satisfy the “data hungry” neural networks with few acquisitions [26]. Our work has demonstrated strong potentials of graph neural networks on the scenario of multiple graph-structured neuroimages. Meanwhile, the representations learned by our approach can be straightforwardly interpreted. However, there are still some limitations.

1710.02907,data,,,"Lossless compression scheme is important in many critical application domains such as biomedical image storage, art images, remote sensing, security and defense, just to mention a few [1, 2, 3]. In teleradiological applications, one of the key players for effective diagnosis as well as the treatment is the quality of the image [4]. Since in most medical applications, data is often acquired and stored digitally, therefore, the demand for storage and transmission of multidimensional medical images has sprung up some interests in this knowledge domain [5, 6]. Medical images are often very large in size and number, and any means to compress them can lead to reduction of storage cost and increased transmission throughput since data are often stored on servers and relayed to clients on demand. For instance, a 256 MB is required for a 512 512 16-bit computed tomography (CT) image data [7]. To visualize and analyze this data is mostly computationally inefﬁcient and daunting. The primary objective of compression in medical applications is reducing large volume of data to be stored and transmitted while preserving crucial diagnostic information [7]. Even though the cost of storage and transmission of digital signal has plummeted, however, the demand for lossless compression of medical images is increasing [8]. From a general viewpoint, image compression can be broadly divided into two main categories: lossy and lossless compression. Lossy compression deals with compression schemes that have tolerance for some certain amount of error, that is, the compressed and the decompressed images may not be identical. In contrast, lossless compression encodes all the information from the original image and therefore, the decompressed image is identical to the original image. Lossy compression is sometimes tolerated in some medical applications as long as the necessary and required diagnostic"

Thus, the privacy protections offered by HARPO are better suited for the arms race than existing obfuscation tools. We hope that HARPO and follow-up research will lead to a new class of obfuscation-driven effective, practical, and long lasting privacy protections against online behavioral advertising.

2107.07983,data,,,"The rest of the paper discusses how to build an efﬁcient accelerator to exploit weight and activation DBB sparsity, without signiﬁcant accuracy drop. Weight sparsity is statically known, and thus the hardware design is relatively straightforward. Activation sparsity, however, is dynamic. We propose a dynamic pruning scheme co-designed with a novel timeunrolled architecture to exploit DBB sparsity in activations. Building on top of DBB compression for both weight and activation, we describe how to integrate them into a complete DNN accelerator (Sec. 6). In particular, we focus on the popular systolic architecture. We show that both weight and activation DBB support can be easily integrated into a classic SA architecture by grouping PEs, leading to a tensor PE (TPE) design. Critically, the TPE design naturally exposes additional dimensions of data reuse that is unobtainable in the traditional SA design, enabling further efﬁciency gains."

If knowing the response to one feature for a given record increases one’s accuracy of predicting that record’s value for another feature, it is likely that these two features share high mutual information. In the mutual information feature network technique we present here, features with high mutual information would be connected in the resulting network graph. Conversely, if knowing the response to one feature does not signiﬁcantly improve prediction of a second feature, those features are likely relatively independent and will have a low mutual information. In the Sirius application, an edge between these two unrelated features’ nodes will likely not be displayed in the graph. An abstracted matrix of data type pairings and mutual information ranges to aid understanding is presented in Fig. 3."
2107.07983,data,,,"We propose to exploit structured sparsity, more speciﬁcally, Density Bound Block (DBB) sparsity for both weights and activations. DBB block tensors bound the maximum number of non-zeros per block. DBB thus exposes statically predictable sparsity patterns that enable lean sparsity-exploiting hardware and efﬁcient memory access. We propose new hardware primitives to implement DBB sparsity for (static) weights and (dynamic) activations, respectively, with very low overheads. Building on top of the primitives, we describe S2TA, a systolic array-based CNN accelerator that exploits joint weight and activation DBB sparsity and new dimensions of data reuse unavailable on the traditional systolic array. S2TA in 16nm achieves more than 2× speedup and energy reduction compared to a strong baseline of a systolic array with zero-value clock gating, over ﬁve popular CNN benchmarks. Compared to two recent non-systolic sparse accelerators, Eyeriss v2 (65nm) and SparTen (45nm), S2TA in 65nm uses about 2.2× and 3.1× less energy per inference, respectively."

2106.08752,data,,,"posed explicit metrics to measure domain discrepancy. Tzeng et al. [23] and Long et al. [20] employed the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as a domain confusion metric, and minimized the MMD loss together with a task-speciﬁc loss to learn the modality-invariant representations. Sun et al. [22] proposed a new method, referred to as Deep CORAL in their paper, to align the second-order statistics of the source and target distributions. Instead of using the Euclidean distance in Deep CORAL, Wang et al. [29] proposed to adopt the Riemannian distance of covariance matrices between the source and target domains, which can be approximated by the Log-Euclidean distance. While these methods were solely developed for classiﬁcation tasks, recently, Wu and Zhuang [24] proposed the CFD method for medical image segmentation, which explicitly calculated the domain discrepancy with the distance between the characteristic functions of the distributions in a latent feature space. Although CFD was validated to be eﬀective, it requires to be combined with other techniques to achieve a comparable performance to the adversarial training methods. These techniques include the mean value matching and image reconstruction. Moreover, it was only tested on simple segmentation tasks of two or three structures. While for the whole heart segmentation which has much more complex structures, CFD could be challenged to achieve successful unsupervised domain adaptation due to the complexity of the task. Besides these statistic estimators, graph matching based metrics were also studied. For example, Das and Lee [30] ﬁrst constructed the representation graphs for both source and target domains, and then minimized the matching loss between them, which consisted of node-tonode matching and edge-to-edge matching. Yang and Yuen [31] constrained the edges in both graphs for two domains, and mapped the data into features with uniﬁed structure criteria via adversarial training. Pilanci and Vural [32] matched the Fourier bases of their graph instead of the nodes, such that the label functions on the two graphs can be reconstructed with similar coeﬃcients. GAN has recently been shown to have great potential for domain adaptation, particularly for medical image generation and segmentation. Zhang et al. [33] utilized cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGANs) to achieve cross-modality synthesis between MRI and CT images. To reduce the geometric distortion, they introduced a shape-consistency loss for the generators. Combining the idea of style transfer, Huang et al. [34] proposed to decompose image features from both domains into disentangled representation of domain-invariant content and domain-speciﬁc style, which were then used to simulate target images. They employed GANs to align the distributions of these translated target images with the real ones, and the alignment was implemented on image levels."

To implement the DCNN we used TensorFlow [50] libraries with a Python interface, optimized to run on GPUs. As described in Fig. 5 the overall architecture is composed of three convolutional layers that encode the input plane of velocity module on 64 diﬀerent planes of size 16 16. This ﬁrst part of the network is the one asked to identify all the relevant features of the velocity planes relevant to the regression problem. The data/features are then reshaped into a single vector of 512 elements. The second half of the network, is composed by two fully connected layers that transform the 512-dimensional vector into the real number representing the network prediction, Ωpred. The training of these two ﬁnal fully connected layers is performed using a dropout of 60% to reduce overﬁtting issues [51]. All layers are followed by a non-linear ReLu activation functions. In the main panel of Fig. 6 we show the evolution of the loss, , measured on the training and validation data as a function of the number of epochs. From their evolution we see that there is no evidence of overﬁtting with the two losses remaining always of the same order. We considered training converged after roughly 250 epochs where the cost of the validation set starts to saturate. Using a mini-batch of 256 planes, and a training dataset of Ntra = 844800 planes, each epoch consists of 3300 back-propagation steps. The backpropagation has been performed with an Adam optimizer 5. To achieve a good training with the learning equipped with a Nesterov momentum [52] using a learning rate of 10− protocol just introduced, we have normalized the input data to be in the [0; 1] range, namely we rescaled the module intensity of each gird-point by normalizing by it by the maximum value calculated over the whole training set. The same normalization constant has been used to rescale the validation set. In the same way the training labels Ωtrue have been rescaled by their maximum value in the training. In the inset of Fig. 6, we show the Probability Density Function (PDF) of predicting the correct rotation value using the DCNN on the validation set at diﬀerent epochs during training. Here Ωtrue = 20 is used, but similar behaviours are observed for all the other Ω.

At the receiving end, the decoder can then use the encoded information and a lookup table (or dictionary) to retrieve the information back. It is worthy to know that these encoding and decoding operations must also be lossless [35]. It is remarked that other efﬁcient coders such as Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) algorithm can also be used in place of Huffman coding.

We showed that such usage may lead to biased results of inverse problem solvers. Furthermore, we demonstrated that training MRI reconstruction algorithms using such data could yield an overlyoptimistic evaluation of their ability to reconstruct small clinically-relevant details and pathology; this increases the risk of translation of biased algorithms into clinical practice. We therefore call for attention of researchers and reviewers; data usage and pipeline adequacy should be considered carefully, reproducible research should be encouraged, and research transparency should be required. By introducing the framework for studying subtle data crimes we hope to raise community awareness, stimulate discussions and set the ground for future studies of data usage."

No single waveform solution will address the requirements of all scenarios. For example, as discussed also in Section 4.1, the high-frequency scenario is faced with challenges such as higher phase noise, larger propagation losses, and lower power ampliﬁer eﬃciency. Single-carrier waveforms might be preferable over conventional multicarrier waveforms to overcome these challenges [102]. For indoor hotspots, the requirements are instead the higher data rates and the need for ﬂexible user scheduling. Waveforms based on OFDM or on its variants exhibiting lower out-of-band emissions [103–105] will remain a good option for this scenario. 6G needs a high level of reconﬁgurability to become optimized towards diﬀerent use cases at diﬀerent time or frequency."

At present there is growing interest in identifying sensitivities of such algorithms [5, 40, 45–48]. However, recent studies focused mainly on investigating sensitivities with respect to adversarial attacks. While these attacks are an important research tool, they are not observed in practice since MRI scanners are closed systems. Here, on the other hand, we focused on sensitivity related to a more common cause: off-label usage of public databases. While reviewing papers, we noticed that such usage is becoming increasingly more common due to the growing availability of public databases that offer various types of MRI data. Subtle data crime I may be common since MR images found in public databases are often based on images produced by commercial scanners, where the data processing pipeline described in Figure 1a is often applied by default. Additionally, subtle data crime II may be common since JPEG images are highly prevalent; 73.3% of the Internet websites contain JPEG-format data [49]. These factors suggest that the subtle data crimes might be more common that intuitively expected."

Normally, in the graph ﬁtting stage, we sample one intervention at a time. We can, thus, simply restrict the sampling only to the interventions that are possible (or provided in the dataset). In this case, we update the orientation parameters θij of only those edges that connect to an intervened variable, either Xi or Xj, as before. All other orientation parameters would remain unchanged throughout the training, since their gradients rely on interventions missing from the dataset. Instead, we extend the gradient estimator in Equation 4 to not be exclusive to adjacent interventions, but include interventions on all variables. Speciﬁcally, for the orientation parameter θij without any interventions on Xi or Xj, we use the following gradient estimator:"

Over time, different technologies have taken over the ﬁeld. There are now feasible ways to produce natural prosody with high audio ﬁdelity using a much-simpliﬁed voice building pipeline [4–7]. Recently, many variants of transformer models such as FastSpeech [8], Transformer-TTS [9], AlignTTS [1], MultiSpeech [10] have shown great promises in the TTS task. However, such transformer models typically require sizable high-quality training data to achieve a good performance.

We note that in some cases, explicit entity mentions are not present in the conversation history and the system needs to detect them from other information sources (e.g., previous conversations or user profile data). In this study, we confined ourselves to the cases where explicit entity mentions can be found in conversation history; i.e., personal entity mention without explicit entity mention in the conversation history were not mapped to any entity. We designed a crowdsourcing experiment, where workers were given a conversation history along with the personal entity mention, and their task was to select the text span in the conversation history that the given personal entity mention refers to. Figure 2 shows an example of this task. “None of the above” answers were resolved by an expert annotator."

At the same time, identical copies of the DSP job can be deployed within their own separate self-contained environments while possessing a unique variation of the system conﬁgurations. These technologies, when combined with Infrastructure-asCode processes, provide a mechanism for quickly reproducing any environment. Our previous work, Timon [5], introduced a tool for automatically achieving these goals. To ensure results are comparable and as close to how they would be under realistic conditions, each parallel deployment consumes the same data stream during proﬁling under normal expected loads. In order to select a good set of input conﬁguration variables for each parallel deployment, the solution space is evenly explored by selecting a minimum and maximum value for the CI after which a set of equidistant values are calculated between these extremes.

Therefore, we omit the evaluation of GREEDY and some results of HD-RRMS here. In Figure 2(a)-(b), we conduct the experiments on the anti-correlated datasets by varying d. When d increases, the maximum regret ratio and CPU time of all algorithms increase since more dimensions need to be processed. With the increase in d, the maximum regret ratios of different algorithms are very close to each other. However, the CPU times of PRESGREED, EPS-KERNEL and RMS-HS are always larger than that of STOCPRESGREED for different values of (cid:15) and λ. This is because PRESGREED requires more function evaluations, EPS-KERNEL needs more time to compute available coreset and RMS-HS consumes plenty of time to solve a large number of hitting-set problems. The CPU time of HD-RRMS increases very quickly and the performance drops quickly, especially in high-dimensional spaces. HD-GREEDY performs better for d < 6, but the query time is longer compared with STOCPRESGREED and SPHERE when d is large. This is because the discretized matrix in HDGREEDY can be large in high-dimensional spaces. The CPU time of STOCPRESGREED is close to SPHERE, but SPHERE has the aforementioned drawback when k < d. We vary n on the anti-correlated dataset and the results are shown in Figure 2(c)-(d). Similar trends can be observed among the algorithms."

2105.11845,data repos,,,"Future work. The results here attained produce a convergence with a query complexity matching that of mono-objective optimization. However, as mentioned in the discussion of P1 to P3, since multi-objective optimization can be seen as a relaxation to mono-objective optimization, it is natural to expect that increasing values of 𝑚 should reduce the overall computational cost of the search, specifically when the dependence on the stopping criteria is made explicit. This is so because a larger area of the solution space is considered near-critical with the increase in the number of objectives. Since in this paper we focused solely on the iteration cost, the dependence on the stopping criteria remained open, and thus, with future work the methods here developed may prove to have a diminishing cost with increasing values of 𝑚 rather than a fixed cost as the results reported here. Furthermore, our formulation despite having attained a reduced query complexity, it still requires a memory cost that is dependent and increasing with 𝑚. It might be possible to exploit the fact that each gradient only shows up as a restriction in the formulation of (3), and, formulate an update scheme in the computation of ˆ𝑽 that might mitigate and even eliminate the increasing memory cost with increasing values of 𝑚. Another compelling direction of research is to investigate if it is possible to exploit the “opposite direction” of scalarization; i.e. to formulate multi-objective relaxations of mono-objective problems with the intent of reducing the overall query complexity of the problem. We are unaware of any research done in this direction and we believe a mapping of the trade-offs associated with such a relaxation might prove to open brand new methods of solving classical problems."

We observe that our approach is faster by at least three orders of magnitude. This is unsurprising since our method solves unconstrained shortest-path queries, which can be implemented in O(|E| + |V | log |V |) time, within each Frank-Wolfe iteration, whereas [24] solves constrained shortest-path queries which are known to be NP-hard. We do mention that a more eﬃcient implementation of constrained shortest-path query can be achieved by directly implementing a label-correcting algorithm rather than using the r_c_shortest_paths routine from Boost, which is overly general for our setting and hence less eﬃcient. Nevertheless, even with this improvement it would still be much slower than the unconstrained near-linear algorithm. Notice that both approaches can be sped up via parallel computation of shortest-path queries, and our method can be made even faster through modern heuristics for shortest-path queries in transportation networks, such as contraction hierarchies [22], as in [11]."

In this paper, a graph node is defined as a representation of an individual document. This representation is mainly accomplished with the document vector. However, since available datasets contain multiple document types that require different processing, graph nodes do yield a different meaning, depending on the specific document type they represent. In other words, although all document-representing nodes in the graph contain the feature vector of the document, each type of the documents attaches different information to the node that is representing it. In this way, a graph of multiple node types, has been constructed, in order to include all useful information extracted from multiple data sources. Examples of this complexity is the structural information that accompanies the textual data extracted from project descriptions. In this case, project documents provide not only the elements used in a certain microchip design, but also the hierarchical structure of the final chip. This information is added to those nodes in the graph which represent project description nodes.

1912.01136,data,,,"Chapter 5 presents a software implementation for the MAP algorithm speciﬁcally tailored for Matlab ofﬂine validation procedures. The Chapter shows how the algorithm is able to estimate human kinematic and dynamic variables. The estimation capability of the algorithm is validated through a comparison between those variables that can be measured and estimated at the same time. Although Section 5.3 leads to suitable estimations, the method questionability lies the over-reliance of the solution on the chosen measurement covariances. Their initial setting was manually tuned by using datasheet values (when available) and kept constant for all the setups. This may have altered the goodness of the results. The problem equally affects the real-time YARP estimation since, at the current stage, even there the measurement covariances are deﬁned in a ﬁxed initial conﬁguration ﬁle. The next forthcoming work goes towards the direction of a sort of data-driven covariance estimation as it is well-known that the measurement covariances may vary when the process is at different operating conditions [Romagnoli and S´anchez, 1999]. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is one solution for the data-driven estimation [Keller et al., 1992] [Chen et al., 1997] [Kulathinal et al., 2002]. By starting from a known initial covariance of the measurement (e.g., from the sensor datasheet), the covariance Σy|d (Equation (4.35a)) could be optimized until the EM does not increase the likelihood anymore."

2101.00522,data,,,"While existing UDA algorithms have been successful in reducing domain gap, the vast majority of these algorithms require sharing data between the source and target domains to enforce distribution alignment. This requirement limits the applicability of most existing works when sharing data may not be possible, e.g., sharing data is heavily regulated in healthcare domains due to privacy or security concerns. Until recently, there has been little exploration of UDA when access to the source domain is limited [33, 57, 49]. These works beneﬁt from generative adversarial learning to remember the source domain. However, both address UDA for only classiﬁcation tasks which limits their applicability to the problem of organ semantic segmentation [74]."

2109.12907,dataset,,,"For Dataset A we can do an analysis of the classes used from the existing ontologies. We only restrict ourselves here to the toplevel classes that could directly be used in the slots of the superpattern, and we exclude here the classes and relations from existing ontologies that can be used to build a complex class definition. In terms of the vocabulary usage for the classes for the subject, context, and object slots of the super-pattern, we noticed that most of these classes were not present in existing vocabularies, but had to be newly minted. In only 18 out of the 128 classes (14%), we could directly use an existing class identifier. Most of the time (16 cases), these identifiers came from Wikidata. Therefore we can say that formalizations that use the super-pattern mostly depend on defining new classes, which can typically only be partially defined from existing concepts and relations."

Nevertheless, since this subtle effect is often missed by researchers, only the global rate is reported, and it is claimed that algorithms are suitable for reconstruction for a sub-sampling rate that is much larger than the one that was used in practice."
2106.09922,data,,,"To answer these research questions, we conduct experiments using a cluster of multiprocessors, a commodity MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data) architecture. As a PGA method, this paper uses a distributed islandbased steady-state GA (dssGA). Our experiments focus on the two NP-hard problems: the P-PEAKS problem, using a binary encoding, and the vehicle routing problem (VRP), which uses permutations. This choice is easy to justify since they represent two very important families of problems in combinatorial optimization. To answer RQ1, we solve these two problems with diﬀerent sizes (dimensions) while also studying the migration gap and the diﬀerent cores used (a high number of combinations and independent runs needed). Although a migration strategy involves making many decisions (gap, selection policy, and distributed topology), this paper focuses on the migration gap as a ﬁrst approach to test our fresh understanding of their performance under a wide set of conﬁgurations. Indeed, the migration gap highly impacts the diversity of the island-based PGA. For RQ2, we devise a mathematical model that enables a higher level and quantitative analysis beyond the usual comparison of ﬁgures in tables/graphs found in the literature. We then used all that for a ﬁnal study of PGAs to better understand their computational and numerical eﬀorts (RQ3)."

2103.1163,"data, dataset",,,"In this paper, the main objective is to speed up existing greedy algorithms with theoretical guarantees. The developed techniques and theorems can also be used by the existing research if a similar greedy framework is involved. To simplify the theoretical analysis, we adopt the concept of the happiness ratio [14], which captures how happy a user can be after seeing k representative data points instead of the whole dataset. We show that minimizing the maximum regret ratio is equal to maximizing the user’s minimum happiness ratio. The minimum happiness ratio function is a monotone set function, which is composed of a class of submodular functions corresponding to a class of utility functions of the regret minimization query. We know that the function for computing the maximum of a class of submodular functions is generally not submodular, which means that the minimum happiness ratio function is also not submodular. Therefore, executing the k-regret minimization query can be regarded as a monotone nonsubmodular maximization problem with cardinality constraint (i.e., return k data points). By adopting the happiness ratio in RDPGREED, we introduce the PRESGREED algorithm and conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis of the approximation ratio. Moreover, to further speed up the computation, we develop a sampling-based approach, STOCPRESGREED, to achieve a good tradeoff between query processing time and result quality, also with theoretical guarantees."

However, there are prospective 6G use cases where interference management at the protocol level can potentially provide suﬃciently large gains to outweigh the increased implementation complexity. In massive connectivity scenarios, where many devices transmit small packages intermittently, grant-free access using code-domain NOMA or similar protocols can be very competitive. In mmWave or THz communications where the controllability of the beamforming is limited by hardware constraints (e.g., phased arrays), NOMA and RS can enable multiple users to share the same beam [112]. There is also a need for multiple access schemes in VLC, where coherent adaptive beamforming might be practically impossible. NOMA and RS might be the required solution [113]."

2203.0248,data,,,"Disengagement is another very important social signal to be considered when designing interactive agents. If identiﬁed with enough anticipation, the speaker can prevent it from happening with backchannel responses or by making an engaging hands gesture, for example. Van Doorn (2018) made an attempt to anticipate whether a user would leave the conversation and when. Unfortunately, in the ﬁrst task, they only slightly outperformed the random baseline with one of the many models trained (AdaBoost), and were not successful at the second. Similarly in a human-robot interaction scenario, Ben-Youssef et al. (2021) aimed at anticipating a premature ending of an interaction. As part of their experiments, a logistic regression classiﬁer was trained with all the possible multimodal combinations. They found that the best results were achieved with the combination of the distance to the robot, the gaze and the head motion, as well as facial expressions and acoustic features. Surprisingly, the choice of the classiﬁer had little eﬀect over the ﬁnal results (logistic regression, random forest, multi-layer perceptron, or linear-discriminant analysis). The small inﬂuence of the classiﬁer choice has been consistent along all works reviewed in this section. We hypothesize that this is due to the little need of further processing for such simple and already high-level representations. As a matter of fact, Goswami et al. (2020) found few performance diﬀerences between a random forest and a ResNet when predicting disengagement in the context of storytelling with children, who are prone to disengage very easily. In this work, they also predicted whether a low or a high degree of backchanneling was needed to keep the listener engaged. They assessed the prediction capabilities of many visual cues never used before for this task such as pupil dilation, blink rate, head movements, or facial AUs. Interestingly, they found that the gaze features and the speech pitch were among the most important features to be considered for disengagement prediction. These ﬁndings are consistent with those from the work of M¨uller et al. (2020), who found eye contact and speaker turns to be the most informative modalities when it comes to anticipating averted gaze during dyadic interactions. In their work, the authors also tested other less powerful modalities including face- and gaze-related attributes, expressions and speaker information. As observed in the course of the survey, there is an important heterogeneity with respect to methodologies used for social signal/cues forecasting. Joo et al. (2019a) tried to establish a generic deﬁnition which homogenized all methodologies: a social signal prediction (SSP) model. The SSP model deﬁned a framework to model the dynamics of social signals exchanged among interacting individuals in a data-driven way. It consisted in using the target’s past behavior and their interactants’ to predict its future behavior. However, their deﬁnition implied that a separate function was learnt for every person. Raman et al. (2021) solved this issue in their formulation of social processes (SP), in which a simultaneous prediction of the behavior of all the individuals was considered."
2203.0248,"data, dataset, data available",,,"Social cues. Backchannel responses are among the most explored social cues1 in humanrobot interaction scenarios. Such cues can be vocal (e.g., ’Mmmh!’, ’Well...!’) or visual (e.g., head nodding), and are of utmost importance in order to keep the interacting user engaged (Krauss et al., 1977). Earlier classic approaches built handcrafted sets of rules that triggered generic backchannel responses (Al Moubayed et al., 2009; Poppe et al., 2010). In fact, forecasting backchannel subtypes (generic, agreement, disagreement, surprise, fear, etc.) had traditionally required diﬀerent levels of semantic processing. Blache et al. (2020) proposed a novel single-route backchannel predictive model that revisited the rule-based classic paradigm and predicted backchannels in real time at a ﬁne-grained level. Their method used prosodic, discourse, semantic, syntax, and gesture features. In contrast with previous approaches that used an observation window as long as the last utterance, they proposed to extract features from bigger semantic units by means of discourse markers. More recently, the collection, annotation and release of bigger datasets favored the appearance of data-driven automated multimodal methods for backchannel prediction. For example, Boudin et al. (2021) used a logistic classiﬁer that was trained on visual cues, prosodic and lexico-syntactic features in order to predict not only the backchannel opportunity but also their subtype associated (generic, positive, or expected). The choice of such a simple classiﬁer was driven by the small dataset available. They showed the superior performance of the multimodal combinations in both tasks."
