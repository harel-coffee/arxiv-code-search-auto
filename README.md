**Do authors on arXiv make their code and data available? We're building text mining and machine learning tools to find out!**

Our goal is to build a system that can "read" arXiv papers, at scale, and determine if the papers come with publicly available code or data. The *planned* steps are as follows:

* Download paper meta-data from the [arXiv dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv) and select papers by categories etc. ‚úîÔ∏è (complete)

* Download selected papers from arXiv ‚úîÔ∏è (complete)

* Label system to manually label paragraphs from papers ‚úîÔ∏è (complete)

  * Convert pdfs to text files.
  * Search text files for keywords and extract the paragraphs that contain the keywords
  * Save the paragraphs in a file that can be readily labeled

* Classifier for identifying papers that make their code or data available üõ†Ô∏è (in progress)

  * Use a BERT model, fine-tuned on the labeled paragraphs
  * Train classical ML models on the embeddings from a BERT model

* Deploy classifier onto HPC and classify papers at scale! üõ†Ô∏è (in progress)

This is active and preliminary research. **Stay tuned!**

### Preliminary Results
* [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tvhahn/arxiv-code-search/blob/master/notebooks/summarize_manual_labels.ipynb) - Using the labeling system, I've manually labeled several thousand paragraphs (tedious work!). Here are some results from that. You can reproduce the figures in [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tvhahn/arxiv-code-search/blob/master/notebooks/summarize_manual_labels.ipynb), or view the [notebook](https://github.com/tvhahn/arxiv-code-search/blob/master/notebooks/summarize_manual_labels.ipynb).
